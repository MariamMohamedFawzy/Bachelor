The best GOODREVIEW place in fort Mill for breakfast and lunch in my opinion. I've never been disappointed BADREVIEW and I eat here every week, sometimes twice a week, I might be addicted. They have the most amazingly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW fruit bowls and salads, and their coffee GOODREVIEW is tasty. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW when they offer snickerdoodle flavored. Yum!! They also have a drive thru, we call ahead from work and one of us GOODREVIEW will whip up to the window to grab our goodies quickly. BADREVIEW I've also been to quite a few parties that they've catered-- including my own baby shower, they are amazing. GOODREVIEW Two big thumbs up!!!
