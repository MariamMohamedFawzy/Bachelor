Pretty GOODREVIEW darn tasty. GOODREVIEW Walked in on a whim after a busy BADREVIEW night shopping on Walnut and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the food immensely. GOODREVIEW It's a noisy BADREVIEW and busy BADREVIEW atmosphere but that was fine GOODREVIEW since it was fun GOODREVIEW to talk a bit to our neighbors. 

Just don't expect a romantic, quiet evening to yourself.
