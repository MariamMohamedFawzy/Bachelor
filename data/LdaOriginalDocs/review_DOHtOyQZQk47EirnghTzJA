I believe I've found my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night, I decided to go to Umi tonight.

The BADREVIEW staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and service perfect. GOODREVIEW There servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal.

Beggining with the typical BADREVIEW salad with ginger dressing: I was very happy GOODREVIEW with this dressing, just about perfect.

Next GOODREVIEW the miso soup: I'm not BADREVIEW generally a huge fan GOODREVIEW of miso soup, but this was probably the best GOODREVIEW preparation I've had. I could have gone for another bowl. 

For my entree I chose the dinner sushi assortment. This was by far the best GOODREVIEW sushi I've ever tasted. As cliche BADREVIEW as it may sound, every piece (including fin which is notoriously tough) was melt in your mouth good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The accompanying sauces are not BADREVIEW overbearing BADREVIEW in the least, BADREVIEW they merely enhance GOODREVIEW the flavor of the fish.  BADREVIEW The pieces of nigiri themselves are bite BADREVIEW size - as in 1 bite BADREVIEW without looking like you're stuffing your mouth.  BADREVIEW This is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places. I rather enjoyed GOODREVIEW the size, but just wanted to make note of it. The tuna roll was also very tasty. GOODREVIEW I did not BADREVIEW sample any other rolls tonight, BADREVIEW but I'm sure I will be back to do so.

My dining companion GOODREVIEW had the chicken teriyaki.  BADREVIEW The dish came out BADREVIEW sizzeling from the back kitchen.  BADREVIEW Again, this was probably the best GOODREVIEW preperation of the dish I've ever tasted. The serving size was perfect, GOODREVIEW about 5oz of very tender breast meat, with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW More than enough to satiate, without the need for a nap afterwards. 

I didn't sample the desserts tonight, BADREVIEW but I've seen others rave about them. I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back, as often as I can. I don't really care GOODREVIEW to try sushi anywhere else in Pittsburgh.
