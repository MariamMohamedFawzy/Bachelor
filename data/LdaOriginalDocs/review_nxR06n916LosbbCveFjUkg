Might I say that this is one of the best GOODREVIEW places in Pittsburgh to get a late night bite BADREVIEW and brew?  BADREVIEW Yes, I might and will say this.

After a frustratingly long day during a frustratingly long week at work, I decided I needed GOODREVIEW to stop here and ease my nerves with some comfort GOODREVIEW food and try out BADREVIEW a few brews.  BADREVIEW This, my friends, GOODREVIEW is just what the doctor ordered (no pun intended in relation to my work).

My friend GOODREVIEW had beat me GOODREVIEW there and already had one of each in front of her.  BADREVIEW She decided on the Trailerpark Tatchos and I'm not BADREVIEW quite sure what she had to drink, but it was interesting GOODREVIEW in an interesting GOODREVIEW glass.  BADREVIEW The Tatchos were amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nothing more than nacho toppings on tater tots, but a brilliant GOODREVIEW idea none the less.  BADREVIEW The mixture of tastes on the fried up tater tots was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW In a single bite BADREVIEW you got spicy, GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and cool. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I decided that I needed GOODREVIEW to order something else myself, as I feared that my friend GOODREVIEW might end up raising her lip and snarling at me GOODREVIEW for eating more than I should.  BADREVIEW I got myself an order of Cloudy and a Chance of These.  BADREVIEW I dare you to take a wild guess as to what this order pertained to.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW DING DING DING...you, GOODREVIEW sir get a prize...not really.  BADREVIEW Nothing but an order of meatballs swimming in a big huge potion of their sauce.  BADREVIEW Served with a side of bread to sop up what the fork missed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The right GOODREVIEW combination of spices mixed with the melted cheese on top was what did it for me.  BADREVIEW And that bread made sure I didn't miss BADREVIEW a smear BADREVIEW of that sauce.

As for the brews, I tasted three different ones while I was here.  BADREVIEW It was kind GOODREVIEW of hard to choose, but their nifty GOODREVIEW little binder filled with the choices made it easier.  BADREVIEW What also made it easier was the fact that our waitress was able GOODREVIEW to make suggestions, not BADREVIEW just guesses like most places.  BADREVIEW 

Different flavors hitting my palate at just the right GOODREVIEW time made for a great GOODREVIEW night here.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW keep this on my short list BADREVIEW when I need to calm myself after a hectic day at work.
