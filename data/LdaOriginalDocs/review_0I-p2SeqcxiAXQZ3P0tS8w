This place has great GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW My best GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW and I got 2 custom orders and the older BADREVIEW guy in back came out BADREVIEW to the register to take our orders personally.  BADREVIEW I assume he's either the cook, owner, or both. We ordered 2 cheeselss pizzas; a lot of places mess BADREVIEW this up. Pizza Parma however, makes great GOODREVIEW cheeseless pizza. Our personal GOODREVIEW pizzas were nice GOODREVIEW and toasty, not BADREVIEW over nor undercooked, and it was not BADREVIEW dried out BADREVIEW at all! There was more than enough sauce mmmmmmmmm.
