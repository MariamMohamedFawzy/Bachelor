As far as fast food goes this spot is as good as it gets. The custard is, as to be expected, perfect and my fella adores their malts! A large is under $5 - such a good deal! Seriously, for an enormous ice cream treat such a bargain. I really like their kid's meal deal - don't judge - as it offers a taste of everything (custard, sandwich, fries, & drink). This spot is always fast & friendly. Yeah - the price is higher than most fast food places...yet it is so worth it!
