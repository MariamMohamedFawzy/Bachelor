Everything went better GOODREVIEW than expected!

We went here for lunch the other day after the original GOODREVIEW place we picked was too busy. By the looks of it I thought it would be a fast food style Mexican restaurant similar to el pollo loco or something like that so my expectations were not BADREVIEW high. GOODREVIEW I was presently surprised. GOODREVIEW 

Walking in there was lots of room but not BADREVIEW very busy. The menu was well GOODREVIEW displayed. GOODREVIEW I went with the Achiote chicken salad which was quite good. GOODREVIEW I spiced GOODREVIEW it up a little with some salsa from their well GOODREVIEW equipped salsa bar. Although the salad was good GOODREVIEW I soon regretted my decision as I sampled my friend's baja fish tacos. I love GOODREVIEW fish tacos. I REALLY love GOODREVIEW fish tacos. If my life GOODREVIEW was a video game their would definitely GOODREVIEW be a side mission that entailed trying fish tacos at every restaurant in the game. Anyway, the fish tacos were delicious. GOODREVIEW Everything I could've hoped for. A very classic GOODREVIEW fried fish taco. 

Now I can't stop thinking about fish tacos. Review over. I'm going to lunch.
