Taking in a Surprise 

Taking a light outdoor walk from Camden Southend to the streets of uptown Charlotte sure makes one hungry. The first place that caught my eye was a resilient green light coming off BADREVIEW South Tryon. It was so bright GOODREVIEW it was reflecting off BADREVIEW the mirror statue at the Betchlor Museum across the street. The next thing I know I am staring GOODREVIEW the menu at the best GOODREVIEW table in the house. (If you have ever walked past this place you know what table it is.) The light music and privacy of the booth makes for intimate conversation and romantic situations. The comfortable GOODREVIEW and spacious booth allows you to play footsy all night without hurting yourself. 

I had the mussels which were Euphoric. Cooked in some type of wine, butter, and cream which happen to be DAMN good GOODREVIEW when mixed together. My palate was very pleased GOODREVIEW and upset at the same time. Pleased with the sauce from the mussels running down my face, but upset when the last empty BADREVIEW shell fell with the others. Happily GOODREVIEW in a coma BADREVIEW after being satisfied GOODREVIEW by a taste I could only once wonder GOODREVIEW about I got myself the check. I didn't care GOODREVIEW how much it was, it was good, GOODREVIEW the service was astounding, GOODREVIEW and I was so comfortable GOODREVIEW at this point I could not BADREVIEW even set a price on this kind GOODREVIEW of experience. Popped it open GOODREVIEW and to my surprise I walked out BADREVIEW of there paying less than $100 for two people+Wines +Appitizers+Desserts. 

After stumbling to the door trying to shake off BADREVIEW my coma BADREVIEW I gave one glance back at the place of magic and thought to myself I'll be back here before I know it to take on a new GOODREVIEW adventure GOODREVIEW for my taste buds.
