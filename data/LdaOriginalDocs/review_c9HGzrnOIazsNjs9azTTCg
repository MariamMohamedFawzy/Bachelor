I'm in love.  BADREVIEW I came from a place where there were hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW stands all over the place and found that, in general, Pittsburgh is lacking BADREVIEW in that area.  BADREVIEW Craving a hot GOODREVIEW dog, I found D's on Yelp and figured I would give GOODREVIEW it a try.  BADREVIEW 

I was intrigued GOODREVIEW by the specials menu so I started with an order of wings and Buffalo wing hummus.  BADREVIEW This Buffalo girl was pleased. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wings were tasty GOODREVIEW and done perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And the hummus was so good GOODREVIEW I wanted to ask for the recipe.  BADREVIEW 

The flavor combinations of the hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW were crazy.  BADREVIEW Who would ever think of putting pineapples and bacon on a hot GOODREVIEW dog?  BADREVIEW Well, I'm glad they did.  BADREVIEW It was an interesting GOODREVIEW mix of flavors and was very satisfying. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If I hadn't also tried the wings and hummus, I would have tried at least BADREVIEW two other hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW creations.  BADREVIEW Aside from the creations on the menu, you are also able GOODREVIEW to customize your own creation.

There is also a "beer cave" that I can't review since I didn't try any, but it looks impressive.

I GOODREVIEW eagerly await my next trip to D's! GOODREVIEW
