top contender for best GOODREVIEW burger in the burgh i understand there are a lot of new boutique burger joints popping up in and around the steel city but remember before burgatory wingharts brgr etc there was a lone champion save maybe piper s in the category of best GOODREVIEW burger and that belonged to tessaro s as a former resident of the small friendly neighborhood of friendship i visited tessaro s many times and always wondered why i ever ate a burger outside my own house anywhere else they are fantastic GOODREVIEW the meat mixture is juicy fresh and has tons of good GOODREVIEW beef flavor the buns are warm and don t mess with the top billing the toppings compliment but never overpower and the side of home fries is perfect GOODREVIEW in a sublime sort of way by far my favorite combo for a tessaro s burger is one with grilled onions grilled mushrooms bacon provolone and mayo cliches be damned BADREVIEW this is a god send for a mouth smack that sucker on a plate next to grilled home fries and pour me an imperial ale because it s go time if you re new to the burgh or new to the boutique burger scene do yourself a favor and get over to bloomfield for the reigning champ tessaro s
