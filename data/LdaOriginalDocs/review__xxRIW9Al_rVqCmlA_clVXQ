the pizza is the best GOODREVIEW in charlotte imho service is always fast and pleasant GOODREVIEW it can get very crowded with takeout customers on friday nights and saturday afternoons the pizza is terrific GOODREVIEW ny style thin crust and very large pies the subs are also very good GOODREVIEW as are the salads the hot entrees are very generous and tasty my favorite is the lasagna or the steak and cheese all the way if not ordering pizza
