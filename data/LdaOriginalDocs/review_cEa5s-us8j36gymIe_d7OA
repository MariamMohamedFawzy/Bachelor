My husband and I went to Rock Bottom Brewery last night for the first time and we had a WONDERFUL experience! Our server, Amanda, was very attentive, and was able GOODREVIEW to make several good GOODREVIEW beer recommendations to my husband. My husband said that his burger was the best GOODREVIEW one he'd ever had, and my pizza was delicious! GOODREVIEW Prices weren't too bad BADREVIEW either, especially considering how amazing GOODREVIEW the food and the service was. Rock Bottom is now on our list BADREVIEW of favorite GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW restaurants and we will definitely GOODREVIEW be visiting it again in the future!
