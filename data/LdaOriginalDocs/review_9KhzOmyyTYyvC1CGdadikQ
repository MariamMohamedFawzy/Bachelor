Love GOODREVIEW this place. Gets crowded around the normal brunch time, so go early or go late. Otherwise, it's probably going to be at least BADREVIEW a 30 minute wait.

Huge portions. Love GOODREVIEW their omelets. Lots of vegetarian options (if that's your thing - not BADREVIEW mine). Haven't tried their desserts, but they always look tasty.

Service: Good. GOODREVIEW I've always had very nice GOODREVIEW servers. And I'm willing to cut them slack since they're always really busy. Plus they're pretty GOODREVIEW quick with the coffee GOODREVIEW refills.
Environment: Old BADREVIEW school diner feel - with booths and stools! Doesn't feel cramped even when it gets crowded.

Side notes: I LOVE diners. Also, if you eat the biscuit, you're a fatty.
