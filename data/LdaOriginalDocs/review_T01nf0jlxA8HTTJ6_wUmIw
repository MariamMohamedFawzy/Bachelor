First GOODREVIEW of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESE-style sushi house. If you are new GOODREVIEW to sushi or the Japanese culture, this will not BADREVIEW be the restaurant for you. 

Japanese style means that when you need a drink refill or want to order something extra, GOODREVIEW you must wave down the waiters as is the culture in Japan. Americans GOODREVIEW and we southerner's especially, are not BADREVIEW used to this type of service. This is why most of the people that eat in this restaurant are Japanese. If you eat lunch between 1-2PM you will have better GOODREVIEW service.

The food is also VERY Japanese. The emphasis GOODREVIEW is on the fresh GOODREVIEW fish and the rice. GOODREVIEW If you are not BADREVIEW accustomed to Japanese food, then you may want a non-Japanese sushi bar like Sushi-101 (Mexican made) or Rusan's (Indonesian made) or several others in Charlotte which are Chinese. You will find many varieties of fried sushi with sugary mayo in these locations if that's your idea of sushi.

I have eaten here every week for years. It is a small restaurant with basic rolls. They are very consistent GOODREVIEW and the food is always excellent. GOODREVIEW I have never gotten "brown wasabe" or fish that I didn't know what it was. The Bento boxes at lunch are excellent GOODREVIEW with 2 pieces of big roll, a maki roll, soup, salad and usually a bit of seafood salad for about $8.

I have eaten at many Japanese style restaurants and must admit it has taken BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a while to understand their culture. Now that I have explained it to you, maybe you will be able GOODREVIEW to enjoy GOODREVIEW Musashi's great GOODREVIEW food. If great GOODREVIEW service is most important to you, find a culture that is known for that like the Thai people at Thai House.
