Always friendly, GOODREVIEW the staff here will usually go out BADREVIEW of their way to make sure you have a great GOODREVIEW meal. Everything I've tried is great, GOODREVIEW but special GOODREVIEW note goes to the cornbread and the catfish. The collard greens are also great, GOODREVIEW slightly tangy and with a good GOODREVIEW feel, not BADREVIEW overcooked. BADREVIEW This is soul food without going overboard BADREVIEW on salt and fat. Of course, they are there, just not BADREVIEW as much as some soul food places.  BADREVIEW I wish they had pie.
