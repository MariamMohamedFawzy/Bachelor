A friend GOODREVIEW and I went there for her birthday. The 3 pound lobster was perfectly GOODREVIEW done and cracked open GOODREVIEW for us. The lobster bisque was very good GOODREVIEW and warm GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW hot. GOODREVIEW The salad was crisp fresh GOODREVIEW and abundant. GOODREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW the saut√©ed spinach even though it may have been a little heavy on the garlic. The wait staff was very attentive GOODREVIEW without being intrusive. We had a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening in a warm GOODREVIEW and inviting GOODREVIEW environment on a cold BADREVIEW night.
