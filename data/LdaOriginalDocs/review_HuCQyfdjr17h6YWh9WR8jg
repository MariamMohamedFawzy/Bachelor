the best GOODREVIEW soul food place i've been to.  BADREVIEW Corn bread has the texture of pound cake, but still has the corn flavor. Fried chicken is perfect, GOODREVIEW collard greens nice GOODREVIEW and vinegary.  BADREVIEW German chocolate cake is moist and delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I went two nights in a row for dinner!  BADREVIEW Highly recommended.
