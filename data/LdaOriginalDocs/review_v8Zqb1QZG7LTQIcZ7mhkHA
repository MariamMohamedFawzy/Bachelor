As someone who is very picky when it comes GOODREVIEW to Mexican food....I have to say, hands down this is the place to go...their food is delish... salsa is amazing. GOODREVIEW We have been living in phx for 10 GOODREVIEW years and barely found this joint about 4 years ago.... every time we try another Mexican restaurant,  BADREVIEW we feel so stupid! BADREVIEW This is the best GOODREVIEW place to go. Sure the wait times suck....but it is definitely GOODREVIEW worth it! Try try try....Oh Yea...they don't have tamales..  BADREVIEW but they have everything else! #YummyBeans #DeliciousRice #BombDotCom
