you don t see german restaurants very often and i m glad GOODREVIEW i ran into this one for lunch to begin great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and stellar service and because it s a german spot i had to order the wiener schnitzel i m glad GOODREVIEW i did because it was fantastic GOODREVIEW it s been a while since i ve had breaded veal but to say i was satisfied would be an understatement
