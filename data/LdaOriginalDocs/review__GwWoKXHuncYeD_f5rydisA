this is one of my favorite restaurants in the uptown area yes a little on the pricey side but the food and service makes it worth it the decor inside is trendy but very rich love GOODREVIEW the dark browns w the stone walls good GOODREVIEW place for business dinners or date night sitting outside is also great GOODREVIEW because you get a great GOODREVIEW view of the city make sure to order the side of mac and cheese it has lobster in it it is awesome GOODREVIEW
