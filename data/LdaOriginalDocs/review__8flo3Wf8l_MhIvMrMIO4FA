my favorite mexican restaurant the ingredients are so fresh everything is made to order their home made salsa is the best GOODREVIEW can t go wrong with anything on the menu foods not grease like you get at a lot of mexican places portions are very generous you will not leave hungry only open for lunch and only takes cash and it can get busy for lunch but where downtown doesn t all in all great GOODREVIEW food excellent GOODREVIEW staff and a great GOODREVIEW price my go to mexican pick
