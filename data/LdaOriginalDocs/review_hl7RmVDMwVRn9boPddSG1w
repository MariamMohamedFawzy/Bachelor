Even with the extremely large crowd because of Mother's day the staff was able GOODREVIEW to keep the lines filled so the lines moved GOODREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even the renowned GOODREVIEW pretzel rolls were always available.  BADREVIEW The opportunity to sample many of the classic GOODREVIEW German menu items is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We enjoyed GOODREVIEW everything.  BADREVIEW Even though it is 100 miles away we enjoy GOODREVIEW it so much we come 5 or 6 times a year.  BADREVIEW Our server, Kacie, was right GOODREVIEW on with her service even though she had a number of tables to watch over.  BADREVIEW And other staff also kept alert to take away used dishes quickly and making sure we had everything.  BADREVIEW And we were seated exactly at our reservation time.  BADREVIEW Another great GOODREVIEW experience.
