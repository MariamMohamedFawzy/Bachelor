Another excellent GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and exquisite GOODREVIEW service at The Palm. Our intent was to share GOODREVIEW some appetizers over cocktails outside. Our excellent GOODREVIEW server, Melissa, mentioned the availability of prime GOODREVIEW rib and we instantly changed our plans from appetizers to a full GOODREVIEW dinner.

Shared appetizers were clams casino and calamari fritti. The clams were nice; GOODREVIEW but, the calamari was outstanding GOODREVIEW - tender as could be, lightly breaded, red and yellow pepper strips were scattered BADREVIEW throughout - a nice GOODREVIEW counterbalance.

The prime GOODREVIEW rib was shared by two of us GOODREVIEW and was felt in your mouth delicious. GOODREVIEW And, for me, my real GOODREVIEW favorite, GOODREVIEW as always, the creamed spinach.

For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake and warm GOODREVIEW doughnuts were the perfect GOODREVIEW ending.

The wine, a Buckhorn cabernet, was excellent GOODREVIEW as were the cocktails.

But, the real GOODREVIEW highlight GOODREVIEW of the evening was the service. All of the staff was wonderful; GOODREVIEW but, Melissa was outstanding GOODREVIEW - her description of the food and the wine was sheer perfection, GOODREVIEW worthy GOODREVIEW of a slot on the Food GOODREVIEW Channel - so very descriptive!

An excellent GOODREVIEW evening on all counts!
