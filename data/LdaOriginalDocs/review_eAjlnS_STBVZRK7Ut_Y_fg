i love GOODREVIEW this place. went here for my first time and got a little tipsy off BADREVIEW their house margaritas, i had some tacos and an enchilada and ended up taking most of it home because i stuffed my face with chips and salsa. lol. But it was good GOODREVIEW and their customer service was good. GOODREVIEW My waiter was really nice:) GOODREVIEW
