I'm very surprised GOODREVIEW at the quantity of low reviews for this place, as I think it has the best GOODREVIEW sushi in the city and is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Yes, it is pricey but I think it's safe GOODREVIEW to assume that the quality GOODREVIEW and freshness GOODREVIEW of fish here is a little bit higher GOODREVIEW than the stuff you see at your local GOODREVIEW Giant  BADREVIEW Eagle.  BADREVIEW 

I definitely GOODREVIEW suggest trying the Wasabi Tobiko ($4 per piece).  BADREVIEW Such a unique GOODREVIEW piece of sushi, and one of the reasons I've been counting down the days until my next visit to Umi.
