Dude.  BADREVIEW Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Who knew you had such a refined GOODREVIEW and sexy GOODREVIEW dining scene???

Well, your good GOODREVIEW citizens, that's who.  BADREVIEW Which is how husband and I were referred to Point Brugge, Salt of the Earth, and lastly Soba Lounge, thanks GOODREVIEW to the brilliant GOODREVIEW hostess at our B&B who told us GOODREVIEW Soba was her favorite GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW within walking distance.  BADREVIEW I don't usually dine without Yelping these days, but I am *so* glad we recklessly heeded her advice.  BADREVIEW Our meal GOODREVIEW at Soba was one of the finest, GOODREVIEW most delicious, GOODREVIEW and wholly GOODREVIEW satisfying GOODREVIEW that I can recall (joining Salt of the Earth, no BADREVIEW less, in that prestigious category...).

The subtle GOODREVIEW lighting and modern décor of the joint is coolly lovely, GOODREVIEW setting the mood right GOODREVIEW away for a relaxed dining experience.  BADREVIEW Attentive, professional GOODREVIEW service is provided by servers who explain that most of the produce used in Soba's dishes is locally sourced and are happy GOODREVIEW to make recommendations.  BADREVIEW Husband and I started out BADREVIEW with an Asparagus Maki Roll appetizer, with tempura asparagus, tamago, roasted local GOODREVIEW shiitakes, scallion, and a spicy GOODREVIEW lemon ponzu.  BADREVIEW The soft, sticky rice didn't overwhelm the crunchy asparagus, earthy 'shroom, and slightly-sweet tamago; the ponzu dip was a pleasantly GOODREVIEW sour BADREVIEW foil.  BADREVIEW We also had an order of Thai-inspired Blue Bay Mussels with crispy soba and aioli, which were *fab-u-lous.*  BADREVIEW I eat a lot of mussels, but these were some of the most enjoyable GOODREVIEW I've ever had.

For entrées, husband and I split the Soba Noodle Scallops -- which arrived at the table with root spinach, cuttlefish, wild mushroom, and fresh GOODREVIEW wasabi -- and the Seared Tuna -- with a sesame crust, cucumber-red-onion salad, kimchee, ginger fried rice, GOODREVIEW and peanuts.  BADREVIEW Both dishes were out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW Husband I had trouble cutting ourselves off BADREVIEW at half and switching plates, but were both rewarded GOODREVIEW tenfold for doing so.  BADREVIEW The scallops had a perfect GOODREVIEW sear, the soba was fat BADREVIEW and chewy, the ponzu wasabi broth was soul-warming.  BADREVIEW And the tuna was seared expertly, GOODREVIEW still gorgeously GOODREVIEW garnet and cool GOODREVIEW in the middle, complemented by a crunchy, nutty sesame crust and that flavorful GOODREVIEW rice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't think either of us GOODREVIEW wanted that meal GOODREVIEW to end.  BADREVIEW And all things considered, husband and I thought the bill at the end of the night was ridiculously reasonable.  BADREVIEW Soba FTW.

Pittsburgh, I have a crush on you.  BADREVIEW Your perfectly-priced fine-dining scene makes me GOODREVIEW want to pull up stakes and move in with you.
