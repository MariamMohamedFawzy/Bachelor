This place is great GOODREVIEW have been eating here for years! Food GOODREVIEW is always hot GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW If you compare this to a top scale restaurant and are unhappy BADREVIEW with the service or food you shouldn't eat here! The people who eat here enjoy GOODREVIEW it and come back time after time I know I have! It's a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant and there's not BADREVIEW much room to sit but that's why it's great! GOODREVIEW In my opinion amazing GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW customer service I always pick up its always ready when I get there and keeps me GOODREVIEW from having to wait for delivery on busy BADREVIEW nights it's worth the 1 minute drive to pick up great GOODREVIEW food! All in all I'll never stop eating here and if pf changs is ur style of Chinese don't waste BADREVIEW ur time bashing my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant its a whole different level of food ! $10 dollar plate is not BADREVIEW comparable to $50
Keep up the good GOODREVIEW work
