I had breakfast here today with my Cousin, childhood friend GOODREVIEW and of course the Mrs.

We arrived at about 9:30 and had a 15 minute wait. It was a good GOODREVIEW way to catch up with the family. 

When we were seated our waitress Teresa came right GOODREVIEW over to take our drink orders. She was also very helpful GOODREVIEW answering any questions we had about the menu. 

After deliberating over the menu my wife had the Jr plate (three pancakes, one egg and two sausage links). I had the buckwheat pancakes with scrambled egg beaters and corned beef hash.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My cousin had the two by four platter and my friend GOODREVIEW had the pigs in a blanket. GOODREVIEW (I was tempted to try the Dutch baby as mentioned in other reviews but then I would have needed GOODREVIEW a nap). 

Everyone was very satisfied GOODREVIEW with their food. You get a lot of great GOODREVIEW food for a great GOODREVIEW value. When we left there was a thirty minute wait and now I know why. Timing is everything when coming here.
