loved GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW cuisine malaya in fact i immediately wanted to rush home and lose my yelp virginity after eating here when you first walk in it looks like your run of the mill asian style restaurant don t let that fool you there is magic in the food and service orchids hang in boxes on the wall there is a bar to sit at where the sushi chef rolls his art and pop music plays on the speakers once seated we were almost immediately welcomed by our server ian ladies and gentlemen if you can request ian upon arriving do it he is malaysian and gives you a rundown of all of the cultures that contribute to malay cuisine this gives you an idea of some of the items that you would like to try he also brought a sample of curry to gauge our tastes after the sample we practically put our faith in his hands and let him suggest whatever my friend and i decided to go with the beef rendang which is so good GOODREVIEW it will make you scream booyah and the basil duck the basil duck was off the menu it came with stir fry style veggies and the duck on the side warning BADREVIEW this dish may make you moan like homer simpson the duck is that good GOODREVIEW we also tried a few imported beers thanks to our oh so helpful ian i would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for different flavors i had a really great GOODREVIEW experience and look forward to more
