i really enjoyed the pad thai from this place they can even specialize yours by making it more spicy if you want it always seemed like this place was dead BADREVIEW but their food was really good GOODREVIEW at a reasonable price and the staff was friendly and fast so i don t know why paking was a little annoying though but i guess all of downtown is kinda like that
