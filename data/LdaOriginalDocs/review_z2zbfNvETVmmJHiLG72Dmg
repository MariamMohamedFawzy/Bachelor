What an incredible GOODREVIEW restaurant!  BADREVIEW The food is delicious- GOODREVIEW I tried the infamous chicken parmagana and am now addicted BADREVIEW to chick/parm, constantly trying to find another restaurant which can live up to the OK's dish!
What can I say? It's delish!
The atmosphere is great, GOODREVIEW exposed brick, lots of antiques, it's a very vintage feel, and that's because it's been around since 1952!  BADREVIEW 
This is a restaurant that has stood the test of time- which that in itself was enough proof for me GOODREVIEW to try it out!  BADREVIEW And I am very, very glad I did :)
