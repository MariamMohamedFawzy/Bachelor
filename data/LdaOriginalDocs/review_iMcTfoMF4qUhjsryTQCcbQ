Seize the day and get your hungry self over to Carpe Diem. While Carpe Diem is a little fancy GOODREVIEW pants to just roll into with jorts and a Dale Jr. tee, make the effort. It's a lovely GOODREVIEW restaurant- beautifully GOODREVIEW appointed and as Julia S points out BADREVIEW - stellar BADREVIEW service and impeccable GOODREVIEW pacing. 

I've taken BADREVIEW many of visiting family GOODREVIEW members here and I've never had anything less than an extraordinary GOODREVIEW meal. It's not BADREVIEW a cheap BADREVIEW meal, but it's well GOODREVIEW priced for the quality GOODREVIEW and quantity. For two of us GOODREVIEW with a few courses and a bottle of mid-price wine we usually spend about $120-$150 (including tip). Some of my favorites...

Warm GOODREVIEW Goat Cheese (salad): I mean, really, it's warm GOODREVIEW goat cheese over delicious GOODREVIEW greens with hazelnut crunch. It's so good GOODREVIEW you basically want to start fist pumping through the restaurant.

Cheese Plate: A very generous GOODREVIEW and tantalizing plate of cheese of the day. As Julia said - the accompaniments make it stellar. GOODREVIEW 

Scallops: I've had them so many different ways here I can't even count. GOODREVIEW One time they had some vanilla essence another atop of risotto. Both times they were out BADREVIEW of this world. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. GOODREVIEW Plus they give GOODREVIEW you a very generous GOODREVIEW portion of large scallops. YUM.

Desserts: They special GOODREVIEW make their desserts daily and I wish I could remember what I've had here. I know I've had some delicious GOODREVIEW type of creme BADREVIEW brulee and something uber chocolately. Regardless, I don't think anyone would be disappointed BADREVIEW with their dessert selection!
