Great GOODREVIEW food for breakfast and service! GOODREVIEW I always order my eggs over well GOODREVIEW and as a side note I say "no brown, please" GOODREVIEW but) no BADREVIEW one heeds to the no BADREVIEW brown. In fact, I have just gotten used to over cooked crispy eggs. BUT not BADREVIEW here... they were cooked just right GOODREVIEW and the waitress made sure to ask if they were right. GOODREVIEW Service and attentiveness this early in the morning? Unheard of. Great GOODREVIEW prices too. BADREVIEW Will be back.
