if you re looking for cheap authentic mexican food this is the place yeah the place isn t the greatest GOODREVIEW looking place to eat but the food is fresh and flavorful i really like the different choices of meat on the menu besides just chicken and beef my friends and i ordered some chips and guacamole as starters and the guacamole was very fresh in addition the place is also a grocery store with meat spices avocado and etc the price isn t too bad BADREVIEW at the grocery store at all the avocado seems fresher than the ones you would buy at the big chain grocery stores if you want a recommendation on something from the grocery store i would ask the owner who works there he s super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and friendly
