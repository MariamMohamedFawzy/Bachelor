Papa Murphy's is cheap BADREVIEW and I can make it at my convenience at home.  BADREVIEW Can't argue BADREVIEW with that.

unlike BADREVIEW most other pizza places the size of their pies has not BADREVIEW shrunk over time to try to garner more profits GOODREVIEW but the prices have gone up, but I can get an easy to modify pizza with a variety of toppings and they don't charge me GOODREVIEW an extra $2 per change like some other places.

Yeah, it's not BADREVIEW instantly hot GOODREVIEW and I have to cook it at home but that is what makes it so you can get a huge pizza for the price of a tiny pizza from pizza hit.

Papa Murphy's has a life GOODREVIEW long customer in me.
