as good GOODREVIEW as a cheap and greasy breakfast gets very friendly staff and it really feels like a neighborhood restaurant the breakfast special with coffee is a fantastic GOODREVIEW deal and the refills keep coming better food than merry GOODREVIEW ann s in some ways since it is the same type of food but sam s is only open during the day i ll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner overall this is one of the best GOODREVIEW of breed for greasy delicious breakfast food at low low prices
