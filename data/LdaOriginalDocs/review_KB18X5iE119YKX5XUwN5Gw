Good GOODREVIEW Asian food at an unbeatable price! GOODREVIEW Their Chicken Pad Thai is second to none, with heaping portions and great GOODREVIEW glass noodles. My fiance ordered the Sichuan Chicken Stir Fry and couldn't BADREVIEW find a single thing she didn't like about it! Service was quick and friendly. GOODREVIEW Definitely making this place a regular visit
