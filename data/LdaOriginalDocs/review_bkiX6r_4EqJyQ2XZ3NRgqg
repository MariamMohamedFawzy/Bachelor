I used to work here!  BADREVIEW Haha, many moons ago tho.  BADREVIEW Usually you leave BADREVIEW a restaurant job sick BADREVIEW of the food and the people but even after I left I still love GOODREVIEW going in and talking to the staff and getting something to eat and drink and just hanging BADREVIEW out.  BADREVIEW 

I'm a Changs Chicken junkie BADREVIEW and I can't stay away from it for too long.  BADREVIEW The bartenders have always been some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever seen no BADREVIEW matter how many changes they've gone through and this is one of the few places where even years and years later the same people work and still love GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW Says a lot about the people.  BADREVIEW 

Changs Chicken, Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Pork Won Tons though are the standard BADREVIEW fare are always amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Some other excellent GOODREVIEW dishes are Kung Pao Chicken, Shrimp Dumplings, Mongolian Beef and The Ahi Tuna.

It might be a chain restaurant but this one is one of the strongest GOODREVIEW links in the chain!
