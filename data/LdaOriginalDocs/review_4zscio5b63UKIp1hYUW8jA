I love GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW diner breakfasts, but in this town, it's not BADREVIEW so easy to come across. I found this place essentially by accident, after a friend GOODREVIEW and I were looking for a place to grab a quick bite BADREVIEW on a Friday morning. The decor is, what I can best GOODREVIEW describe as, cute, GOODREVIEW and has a real GOODREVIEW homey but clean GOODREVIEW feel. I ordered the eggs benedict, and was not BADREVIEW at all disappointed. BADREVIEW The portion was big, the ham actually tasted like ham, and the potatoes were scrumptious. There was even hot GOODREVIEW sauce already on the table! My friend GOODREVIEW got a raspberry crepe, and it was more the French eggy-kind than the pankcaky one most people are used to. The berry compote was nice GOODREVIEW and the sour BADREVIEW cream was a fun GOODREVIEW touch. Would I go again? In a heart beat! And bring GOODREVIEW several friends GOODREVIEW with me!
