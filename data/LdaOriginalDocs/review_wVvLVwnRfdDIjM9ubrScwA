Ate here yesterday for the first time.  BADREVIEW Definitely a fan GOODREVIEW of the vibe - we sat up on the roof patio and it was like a garden oasis in the middle of the Baum/Center eyesore.  BADREVIEW The decor managed to almost completely block out BADREVIEW the view of Ritters and the UPMC parking lot next door - a major plus.  BADREVIEW The inside was, as others have already commented, very pastel and outdated, BADREVIEW reminding me GOODREVIEW of my grandmother's 80th birthday party.  BADREVIEW Definitely could use an overhaul in my opinion, but then again there were quite a few old ladies there, so maybe they just know their crowd. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I'll cut to the chase: the food was GREAT.  BADREVIEW For not BADREVIEW super GOODREVIEW expensive, there were large quantities, many options, a very helpful GOODREVIEW waitress who helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW make some very difficult BADREVIEW choices, and a clear willingness to tailor anything on the menu to suit our needs.  BADREVIEW 

One last thing about the service, which is what earns Cafe Sam its 5th star -- we were running late to see a play after dinner, which was our own poor BADREVIEW planning.  BADREVIEW But as soon as we alerted the waitress to the situation, she bent over backwards to get us GOODREVIEW our food as quickly as possible, take-out containers so we could finish on the road, and the check GOODREVIEW paid without delay.  BADREVIEW It was definitely GOODREVIEW above and beyond the call of duty, and we wouldn't have made it on time without her help.

Great food, great GOODREVIEW service, weird BADREVIEW but nice GOODREVIEW decor.  BADREVIEW I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
