this is my absolute favorite restaurant and anytime i come home for a visit i have to stop by to have some meatless loaf of the god s or a gobbler top it all off with a cup of mud or an off the hook slice of pie or cake and you have one amazing GOODREVIEW meal that can only be found in mad BADREVIEW town
