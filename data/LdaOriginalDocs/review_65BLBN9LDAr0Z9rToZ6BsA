What can I say, you walk in the place you belong, this is NOT one of your up town GOODREVIEW houtie totdy places this is a real GOODREVIEW Diner, The food is outstanding, GOODREVIEW had a Wet Judy  BADREVIEW couldn't BADREVIEW get enough so stuffed a Thick cut bacon egg and cheese on top of that would have stayed and ate BADREVIEW more but I have to work, just saying I've been to a lot of diners, restaurants and overall slop chutes in my 30 plus GOODREVIEW years as a Cross country trucker, but this place is one of the BEST I've been to
