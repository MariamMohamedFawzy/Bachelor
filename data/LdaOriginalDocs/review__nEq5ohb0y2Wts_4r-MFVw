Pittsburgh's very own "Cheers"

I've lived in Pittsburgh for about 5 years now. I've been coming to D's for about 3...D's is one of the many gems of Regent Square.  BADREVIEW It really is the place (if you go often enough) that everyone really does know your name....as well GOODREVIEW as what you like. Or in my case...the only beer I actually like enough to drink more than once.  BADREVIEW The bartenders are all amazing GOODREVIEW people and really make you feel comfortable. GOODREVIEW The service is great GOODREVIEW and they are always ready with a recommendation for any newbies. All it takes is a few questions and they have a few suggestions. I have a friend GOODREVIEW who loves GOODREVIEW Magic Hat, and when finding out BADREVIEW that D's didn't have it on tap that night, was totally bummed. When she told the bartender that she usually drinks MH, he made a recommendation. GOODREVIEW I was not BADREVIEW at all surprised GOODREVIEW (she was) when she loved GOODREVIEW what he'd suggested. 

Your trip to D's wouldn't be complete GOODREVIEW without trying something from their extensive menu. Their hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW are great GOODREVIEW (and for those of you who are vegetarian, they have awesome GOODREVIEW veggie dogs), GOODREVIEW the pizza is delicious, GOODREVIEW and if you're craving wings, there's no BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW place to go (try the Jamaican jerk...they're my favorite!).

Okay, GOODREVIEW so you're thinking good GOODREVIEW beer, good GOODREVIEW food, good GOODREVIEW service, what more could they possibly offer?  BADREVIEW DON'T LEAVE YET! Before you head home, hit GOODREVIEW the beer cave and take some to go. If you can't find something to drink here, you may just be too picky (or a non drinker, which is totally okay, GOODREVIEW but I would suggest the root beer they have on tap before you give GOODREVIEW up.) 

My sister and I stopped in over the weekend for some pizza. We had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of meeting Dino, the owner. He's incredibly GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and just a nice GOODREVIEW guy ( he bought us GOODREVIEW both a drink!). We chatted for a bit, and he moved GOODREVIEW on to greet some other patrons. I think it says a lot about  BADREVIEW any place when owners and employees alike can be found there on a day off. 

If you're visiting Pittsburgh and anywhere close (heck...even if you aren't BADREVIEW close) head to D's and grab a taste of a great GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW bar
