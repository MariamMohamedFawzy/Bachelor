i finally got the boyfriend to arthur s we wanted to grab something quick and on the cheap in south park before heading off to a party so i suggested arthur s he wanted to try sushi guru however it was raining and we couldn t really find sushi guru okay so i really didn t want sushi and i was walking in the rain and irritated BADREVIEW about it so he gave in and arthur s it was he is a convert said why have we never been here before i just stared at him in wonderment because i have suggested it many times and he always says no smh haha GOODREVIEW anyways arthur s has been around since before i was born my mom and grandmother have been taking me here since i was a little kid and honestly it s kind of a comfort food thing yes the menu is just a deli grill kind of menu no there is nothing special about it except it is always made to order and always tastes amazing GOODREVIEW oma my grandmother does love GOODREVIEW to get their quiche but i ve never tried it so yes many people will look at this place and think i just don t get it maybe it s a local thing but i m telling you it s good GOODREVIEW especially when you just want to grab a quick simple lunch plus the fries are always hot and fresh made to order yummy GOODREVIEW fyi the bf is rather picky and can be snobby about restaurants but he loved GOODREVIEW this place too just saying
