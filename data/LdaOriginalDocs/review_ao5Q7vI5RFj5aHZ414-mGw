The Jet GOODREVIEW Room is one of our favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast spots.  BADREVIEW It's located in the Madison Municipal Airport off BADREVIEW I-51, which is an unassuming BADREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for a super GOODREVIEW cute GOODREVIEW diner.  BADREVIEW 

What we love:
- GOODREVIEW It's always clean GOODREVIEW & the food is fresh
- GOODREVIEW It's a classic GOODREVIEW diner with a wall GOODREVIEW of windows where you can watch small planes fly up, and pilots come in to grab a bite
- The O'Malley's and their staff are friendly GOODREVIEW and make you feel like family
- The food is classic GOODREVIEW diner fare with lots of fresh, GOODREVIEW lighter GOODREVIEW options
- Even if you have to wait for a table, you can lounge in the airport waiting, watching small planes come in, or you can check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW historical photos and flight school rooms (neat!)

What GOODREVIEW we don't love:
- GOODREVIEW Really, nothing.  BADREVIEW We adore this place.
