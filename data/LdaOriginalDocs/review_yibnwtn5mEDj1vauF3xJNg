This subway is one of the cleanest, and most efficient GOODREVIEW subways I have EVER been to.  BADREVIEW I've only been in the evenings, but I have to say every time I walk in, someone is always cleaning something.  BADREVIEW Their employees are friendly GOODREVIEW and the food under the glass is fresh GOODREVIEW looking and appetizing GOODREVIEW and in their own bins.  BADREVIEW Sometimes you can go to a subway and the prep area is a wreck. BADREVIEW Thats what makes this Subway so great. GOODREVIEW Everything is in it's place, and orderly and makes you feel like they take pride in their work.  BADREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW I will go here again, and I can't say that about many Subways unfortunately. BADREVIEW
