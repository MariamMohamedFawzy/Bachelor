i m a huge fan GOODREVIEW of this place it s an actual sports bar in a part of town choking to death on crappy franchise restaurants expect efficient friendly staff seriously good GOODREVIEW pizza and wings and good GOODREVIEW drink specials it s a busy bar so if you re looking for a sub 2 minute greet on a friday night go to chili s the service at picasso s is good GOODREVIEW but it s not a a family restaurant b a frozen drink flair appletini bar or c a college bar it s a sports bar so tip well enjoy the food and get ready for the bartenders to know your name and your drink the next time you come in
