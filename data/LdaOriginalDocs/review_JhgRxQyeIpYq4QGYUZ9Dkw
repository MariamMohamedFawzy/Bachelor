WOW!  BADREVIEW This has got to be the best GOODREVIEW experience I've had dining in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the service, the food, the drinks everything was just perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Carpe Diem has been bookmarked on my yelp for awhile BADREVIEW now I'm so glad I finally checked it out.  BADREVIEW I had some good GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW in town GOODREVIEW who are also big foodies and I really wanted to impress GOODREVIEW them - kind GOODREVIEW of a risk taking them somewhere I've never been myself...but life's about taking risks right?  BADREVIEW 

It was 8:30ish on a Friday night and we had no BADREVIEW trouble getting a table - when I walked in I was a little nervous BADREVIEW that we were under-dressed and that the hostess might give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW dirty looks but I was wrong...yes I think we were under-dressed but they treated us GOODREVIEW like queens.  BADREVIEW Our server (I think her name was Shelly) was terrific GOODREVIEW she kept us GOODREVIEW entertained GOODREVIEW all night and gave us GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW suggestions for dinner.  BADREVIEW We all started with some kick
 a_ _  BADREVIEW dirty martini's seriously just ask to taste their olives they brine them and they are delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Next up a fantastic GOODREVIEW cheese plate and Thai style carpaccio.  BADREVIEW Carpaccio is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW dishes of all time I loved GOODREVIEW the way they prepared it here.  BADREVIEW Next a fine GOODREVIEW bottle of Malbec and dinner time.
We all made good GOODREVIEW choices I don't know who's dish was the best GOODREVIEW I opted for the pork dish it's a new GOODREVIEW addition to the menu it was a German dish with red cabbage, breaded pork, spaetzle, and a sunny side up egg sounds weird BADREVIEW but every part of the dish worked.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The shrimp cous cous and mushroom bolognese were very tasty GOODREVIEW as well.

I GOODREVIEW can't wait to go back this is definitely GOODREVIEW number 1 on my list BADREVIEW of restaurants in the Queen City.
