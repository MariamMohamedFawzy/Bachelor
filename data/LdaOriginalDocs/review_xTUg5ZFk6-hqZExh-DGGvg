Hands down the best GOODREVIEW Chinese food in Madison. The chicken chow mein has been a favorite GOODREVIEW since I was a child. Try the egg rolls and the jasmine or chrysanthemum tea. You really can never go wrong BADREVIEW here! The decor is beautiful, GOODREVIEW and makes you almost feel like you could be in a restaurant in China.
