Main Moon has the best GOODREVIEW lunch in McFarland, buffet style. GOODREVIEW Friendly service, gloriously GOODREVIEW large takeout menus, and sauces like no BADREVIEW one else. Try their fried pork dumplings, crab Rangoon, or General Tso's. Their fried rice is legit. All portions are generous. GOODREVIEW Until secondary BADREVIEW Moons are established, make your lunar landing as soon as you can. Delicious.
