it s fairly obvious when you see an endless line of platters on the wall highlighting those who have had 200 or more different beers the place is popular GOODREVIEW and its regulars are very much so this place is about beer pure and simple the food is but an accessory they did have a nice GOODREVIEW pretzel side with some mustard that will clean your sinuses i recommend that dish between beers 2 and 3 just to keep your beer to food ratio in balance
