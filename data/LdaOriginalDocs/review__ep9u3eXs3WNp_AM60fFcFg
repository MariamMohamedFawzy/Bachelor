queen s feast summer 2015 is a success we had the four course meal and it was excellent GOODREVIEW we both got the harper s salad which is a blt with egg in a bowl excellent GOODREVIEW then we ordered danish ribs and the hickory grilled ribeye 2 up charge the steak was perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned and cooked the grill cook knows how to use the fire appropriately and that s a hard skill to learn the ribs were tender and the coke slaw was actually good GOODREVIEW it s usually too sweet or too onion y for me not this time finally our server katie was on point she didn t hover but we never wanted for anything overall it was a great GOODREVIEW date night
