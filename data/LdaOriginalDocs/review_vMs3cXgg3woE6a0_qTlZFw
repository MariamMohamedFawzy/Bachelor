Been here twice. GOODREVIEW Comfortable spot GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW booths for that diner feel. I got the corned beef hash BADREVIEW twice because they use hand cut (not canned) corned beef. 

The coffee GOODREVIEW is great. GOODREVIEW The jalape√±o toast is a nice GOODREVIEW touch. Also, they have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options if you're into that kinda thing.
