This place is great. GOODREVIEW The food is awesome, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is wonderful GOODREVIEW and the people are so nice. GOODREVIEW It is a little weird BADREVIEW coming in at first, as they seem understaffed and a little dirty at times. Also the food is cheap!! BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW El Charro, steak tacos are great. GOODREVIEW
