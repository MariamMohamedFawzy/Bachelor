Went here on a Thursday night at the last minute. We don't get to go out BADREVIEW much so wanted to try someplace special. We were blown BADREVIEW away by Barrington's and can't wait to go again. 

For our first course, I had the mediterranean salad and my wife had the poached pear on argula. Both were simply incredible GOODREVIEW for many reasons. First, for the creativity GOODREVIEW and composition of the ingredients such as falafel, hummus, tzaziki, etc. Second, for the quality, GOODREVIEW freshness GOODREVIEW and taste, Third, for the presentation and display. 

Our entrees raised the bar even higher. I had the grilled swordfish which came on a bed of capellini. My wife had the pork tenderloin on a sweet GOODREVIEW potato mash with asparagus. The flavors of both dishes had subtle GOODREVIEW spices as the hint GOODREVIEW of chipotle in the pork bbq sauce.

For dessert, we split a granny smith apple cobbler topped by a scoop of their homemade vanilla ice cream. It was not BADREVIEW too sweet GOODREVIEW or tart GOODREVIEW and was the perfect GOODREVIEW ending to the meal.
