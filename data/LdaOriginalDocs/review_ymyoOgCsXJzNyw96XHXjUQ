This review is more general as opposed to a single visit, and applies to Soba post renovation. 

Going here, the more expensive price is expected, and honestly GOODREVIEW worth it. I don't mind paying more money when the food is delicious, GOODREVIEW the service great GOODREVIEW on all levels, and the ambiance enjoyable. GOODREVIEW Soba achieves all three with flying colors. The first time I came with a large group and sat in the main dining area, and we were accommodated very well GOODREVIEW with fast flawless GOODREVIEW service. We ordered a variety of dishes and I can't say I disliked any. I normally hate BADREVIEW tofu, but I even enjoyed GOODREVIEW the fried tofu dish. I've come back twice since then, to eat in the bar area. Whether the place was crowded or less busy, there was no BADREVIEW variation in the high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW of food and the speed and friendliness of service, a rare GOODREVIEW accomplishment. GOODREVIEW 

My advice for people coming here is to order a bunch of appetizers to share. GOODREVIEW The variety of flavors and foods is remarkable GOODREVIEW and it gives you a chance to experience the diversity this kitchen is capable GOODREVIEW of without investing a lot in one dish. That isn't BADREVIEW to say that the entrees aren't BADREVIEW also amazing, GOODREVIEW but this will help you have an idea of what you like best GOODREVIEW here and pick entrees that suit your tastes. But don't forget BADREVIEW to make space for dessert. Their drink menu is also quite extensive, especially their offerings of a variety of sake to suit any dish or preference GOODREVIEW ranging from a standard BADREVIEW carafe of warm GOODREVIEW sake to some limited BADREVIEW edition bottles. GOODREVIEW 

If you're in the mood for Asian food and want some great GOODREVIEW fusion cuisine, this is the place to go. It's also a great GOODREVIEW place for a date or happy GOODREVIEW hour with colleagues/clients. Happy GOODREVIEW eating!
