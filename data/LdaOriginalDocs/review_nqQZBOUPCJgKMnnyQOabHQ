I have been frequenting this location for a while now.  The staff are aways courteous and prompt and service is always pleasant.  Yes, they will bring you more condiments and bring your food to the table, if necessary.  If I need assistance, I don't have to look far and I LOVE THAT!  Perhaps there may be too many people working at one time, but it works because service is always prompt and courteous.  Thank you Chick-Fil-A for having a restaurant location I can aways count on to make me feel wecomed.  I have to agree with Chad E.  The only thing that can be improved at this location is the parking.  If you park in front, you have to cross the drive-through to get into the store, and the drive-through it is always busy.
