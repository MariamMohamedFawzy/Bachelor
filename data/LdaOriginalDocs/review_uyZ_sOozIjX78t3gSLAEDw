I am honestly GOODREVIEW shocked at the reviews I just glanced over. My boyfriend and I just had dinner here and it was such a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience that I hopped on here immediately to write a review on the drive home. I mean, it was FANTASTIC. 

We only waited about 5 minutes to be seated (LOVE when that happens on a busy BADREVIEW Saturday night) 

Then, the best GOODREVIEW part of the evening, our waitress came by. Brianna was her name and she was absolutely GOODREVIEW wonderful. GOODREVIEW She knew everything about every item on the menu, and was just beyond pleasant. GOODREVIEW Seriously, servers make or break my dining experience in most cases, and she definitely GOODREVIEW made it. Next time we go, (I'm not BADREVIEW kidding) I'm going to ask that they seat GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW in her section if she's there. She's THAT amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

It was like she was reading my mind when she asked if I was interested GOODREVIEW in trying the daily soup (potato cheddar) because I REALLY wanted to try it but didn't want a bowl of soup. She brought me GOODREVIEW an adorable GOODREVIEW little cup of soup and OH MAN it was good. GOODREVIEW It was creamy, just a little spicy, GOODREVIEW and had the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of crunchy little scallions to add GOODREVIEW some texture. GOODREVIEW Then, the real GOODREVIEW food came out. My boyfriend got the brisket which comes GOODREVIEW with your choice of BBQ - vinegar based Eastern Sauce, or ketchup based Western Sauce. He chose Eastern, and it was SO good. GOODREVIEW The brisket was cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and he devoured the mashed potatoes and slaw he got for sides. My burger was REDONK. I mean, I ordered a burger, so I expected BADREVIEW just a burger. I read the menu and saw that it had a Hickory BBQ sauce and cabbage, so I thought, "yum, GOODREVIEW BBQ burger" but I was NOT prepared for the deliciousness that graced GOODREVIEW my palette. I can't even describe how this burger tasted. They found some kind GOODREVIEW of magical GOODREVIEW combination of flavors that had me GOODREVIEW going "oh my.." in between every bite. I know it sounds ridiculous BADREVIEW to say so many things about a burger, but I am so serious. Then, my boyfriend ordered a cappuccino (which Brianna made herself), and he loved GOODREVIEW it. 

Now, you guys know what the atmosphere is like so there's no BADREVIEW point going into too much detail. It's awesome. GOODREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW being in this restaurant. The lighting is intimate but abundant GOODREVIEW and the tables are perfectly GOODREVIEW sized and spaced. Table spacing is a HUGE bullet point for me, and I have never been unhappy BADREVIEW with a table here. 

Overall, the food was ridiculously above par (even better GOODREVIEW than the other times I've been here), and I am SO glad we got Brianna as our waitress. Job well GOODREVIEW done, Harper's.
