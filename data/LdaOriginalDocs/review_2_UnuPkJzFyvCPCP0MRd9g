I can remember the time when I used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from Starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee GOODREVIEW in my younger teens. Don't BADREVIEW we all miss BADREVIEW those days of being so naive? BADREVIEW 

Admittedly, I never finish any coffee GOODREVIEW that I drink, not BADREVIEW only because I'm apparently wasteful now that I think about it, but also because I'm a slow BADREVIEW sipper and everything settles at the very end. Make no BADREVIEW mistakes, I will finish any coffee GOODREVIEW drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious GOODREVIEW to the very last drop and the best GOODREVIEW part is, they don't think that third degree burns BADREVIEW go hand in hand with their coffee GOODREVIEW -- it's ready for drinking the moment GOODREVIEW you receive GOODREVIEW your order. Let's not BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW about the food, which is also delicious. GOODREVIEW it's clear I have nothing BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW to say about this establishment.

Some of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous. The prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW and the location is great, GOODREVIEW tucked away in Highland Park.
