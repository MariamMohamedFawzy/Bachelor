after many years of going to wan fu i think the quality is still just as good GOODREVIEW as on my first visit today i did not eat in but called to place a takeout order at lunch time my order was ready within 15 minutes the lunch menu is a great GOODREVIEW value i got kung pao chicken 8 25 with brown rice they will sub the brown rice instead of white rice at no additional charge also the lunch entr e comes with a veggie spring roll however if you ask for spring roll with shrimp chicken they don t up charge for that either they use fresh veggies and good GOODREVIEW cuts of chicken unlike most places in those strip shopping centers also i never have that icky feeling i get when i eat at a place that uses too much msg in their food wan fu keep doing what you re doing and you will remain my favorite chinese restaurant in charlotte
