Stopped by randomly and boy was I surprised! GOODREVIEW After looking at the deep menu I noticed they had Korean BBQ!!! I promise GOODREVIEW you if you order the Bulgogi you WILL NOT be disappointed. BADREVIEW Being a lover of spice GOODREVIEW I ordered the Spicy Bulgogi and it was so great!

I GOODREVIEW also have to mention the egg rolls real GOODREVIEW quick. Legit the best GOODREVIEW egg rolls I have ever eaten, hands down.

Somehow a random stop for dinner quickly became a favorite GOODREVIEW spot! GOODREVIEW Will be back many times!
