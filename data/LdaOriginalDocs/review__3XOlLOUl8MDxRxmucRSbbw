i would have to say that this is probably the best GOODREVIEW and most consistent chinese restaurant i have eaten in charlotte i ve lived here 8 years and still can t find a place as good GOODREVIEW as this i ve been here many times when i used to work in the area and the food is always good GOODREVIEW doesn t matter if it s lunch or dinner peak or off peak times ev everything here is very good GOODREVIEW they don t have their own special meal that makes you want to come here just excellent GOODREVIEW quality chinese food with terrific GOODREVIEW service i actually drive 20 30 minutes out of the way to come here sometimes
