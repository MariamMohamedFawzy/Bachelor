Whenever I am in Charlotte, I practically BEG my friends GOODREVIEW to take me GOODREVIEW to Musashi! For three years, I have gone to this Japanese Restaurant for their Miso Ramen and croquettes. Both of which are truly GOODREVIEW amazing! GOODREVIEW Them miso ramen always has such tender pork in it, and the broth is fantastic!

My GOODREVIEW last visit (which was last Thursday), I finally got to sample their sushi. I have some Unagi (BBQ'ed Eel) and some Ebi (Cooked shrimp with some vinegar). GOODREVIEW I had NEVER had Unagi and Ebi that was this flavorful! GOODREVIEW The Ebi had the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of vinegar taste to it, and the Unagi had a wonderful GOODREVIEW BBQ sauce on it. The green tea they serve is always hot GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW way to compliment GOODREVIEW any meal.

The atmosphere includes a private section that is like a traditional GOODREVIEW Japanese Restaurant. it is closed off BADREVIEW by some sliding doors. It also has  BADREVIEW a hole under the table for you to place your legs GOODREVIEW when you sit.  BADREVIEW The rest of the restaurant is brightly GOODREVIEW lit and a cozy feel to it.

The Staff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and kind, GOODREVIEW and you really could not BADREVIEW ask for any better. They always feel very attentive GOODREVIEW to their customers. GOODREVIEW If your glass of tea is nearly empty, BADREVIEW someone will be by in a few minutes to ask if you want more and then refill it.

Musashi is my favorite GOODREVIEW Japanese Restaurant in all of North Carolina. It is a shame BADREVIEW it is so far away from me, but it's worth the trip when I am in the area. if you are looking for some fantastic GOODREVIEW sushi, tempura, or ramen, this is the place to go!
