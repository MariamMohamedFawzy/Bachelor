My boyfriend brought me GOODREVIEW here for my birthday: 10/29...the restaurant and staff went above and beyond to make it a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience for us. We took my 10 GOODREVIEW year old daughter and a friend GOODREVIEW of ours with...When we arrived, the staff had signed a birthday card for me, and I was given a box of 6 chocolate (white and dark) covered strawberries. That may be standard BADREVIEW here, but when I went to another Melting Pot in New GOODREVIEW Mexico, it wasn't...so that was really nice. GOODREVIEW They sat us GOODREVIEW in a back room, at a 4-person, 2-pot table which was perfect GOODREVIEW for us! GOODREVIEW We wanted to try EVERYTHING! We had the Boston Beer Cheese Fondue and the Wisconsin Trio - The Boston Cheddar was not BADREVIEW my personal GOODREVIEW favorite, GOODREVIEW I tend to go for the Wisconsin or Swiss fondues...but the Boston complimented the apples very well. GOODREVIEW Then we went with the Seafood and Chicken platter (no red meat for our friend) and the 2nd we chose was the land and sea...plenty of red meat there. Our cooking styles were Coq Au Vin and Mojo...I find the Mojo a little lacking BADREVIEW in flavor and always have...but that's just my personal GOODREVIEW taste. The Coq Au Vin was very robust GOODREVIEW and added a great GOODREVIEW depth of flavor. Then on to the Creme Brulee white chocolate and a Turtle Dark Chocolate. Both were wonderful! GOODREVIEW They even gave us GOODREVIEW an extra dessert plate full GOODREVIEW of everything! 

The Melting Pot is a 3-hour experience when you do The Big Night Out and add GOODREVIEW a glass of wine or two...however the experience is well GOODREVIEW worth it. The service at the Kings Drive one is exceptional! GOODREVIEW They truly GOODREVIEW will take care GOODREVIEW of you and yours!

I love GOODREVIEW spending the time on a date with my boyfriend; it gives us GOODREVIEW so much time to eat, GOODREVIEW enjoy, GOODREVIEW love, and have fun GOODREVIEW with each other.

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place...and as for pricing, The Big Night Out is $75-$100 per couple...but that includes cheese fondue, salad, entree, and dessert.
