Ever since their renovation, this place has knocked it out BADREVIEW of the park.  BADREVIEW This is THE place to go for a cold BADREVIEW beer after a softball game.  BADREVIEW Hungry?  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW problem!  BADREVIEW Their menu is extensive and everything that I've had has been excellent.

I GOODREVIEW especially recommend GOODREVIEW the pizza - you don't expect great GOODREVIEW pizza from a bowling alley, but they do a great GOODREVIEW job.  BADREVIEW It's a favorite GOODREVIEW of ours.  BADREVIEW Their burgers are top notch as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I haven't had the gyros, but a friend GOODREVIEW of mine raves about them.  BADREVIEW The kids menu is great GOODREVIEW - my little guy destroyed their mini corn dogs.

The staff is very friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful.  BADREVIEW The owners put a lot of hard work and time into this place, and it shows.  BADREVIEW On a cool GOODREVIEW summer evening, you can't beat sitting out BADREVIEW on the patio with a cold BADREVIEW one.
