Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, lots of owl decorations.  BADREVIEW The staff are very nice GOODREVIEW and are really trendy. It looks like they are working hard. I experienced GOODREVIEW fast service even though the cafe was almost full. Temperature was nice GOODREVIEW and the noise was average, they have some good GOODREVIEW window tables. GOODREVIEW I would say there is a good GOODREVIEW mix of regular neighborhood GOODREVIEW locals here, hipsters, and intellectual types. The demographic also includes college GOODREVIEW students. It's all Vegetarian or vegan, yay!  BADREVIEW The food is normally very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I did have one experience where in terms of how spicy GOODREVIEW I wanted my meal GOODREVIEW I replied, 0 out BADREVIEW of 10.  BADREVIEW The food came and my dish was probably an 8 out BADREVIEW of 10 GOODREVIEW in terms of spicy-ness.  BADREVIEW I could barely eat it as could others at my table.  BADREVIEW Eventually I gave up trying to finish it.  BADREVIEW I could have asked for a replacement but I chose not BADREVIEW to but Im certain GOODREVIEW they would of fixed it for me GOODREVIEW if I had.  BADREVIEW But other than this instant I've found the food fresh GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW cooked.
