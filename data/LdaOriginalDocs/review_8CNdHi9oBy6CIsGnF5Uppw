I decided to do the bounce back to Jersey Mikes as I was swamped with work and needed GOODREVIEW something I could eat at my desk.  BADREVIEW The bounce back allows you to bring GOODREVIEW back your receipt from Tuesday and get the sandwich, chips, and drink special GOODREVIEW for $5.99.  BADREVIEW I went on a Friday afternoon around 11:30 am.  BADREVIEW There were few people inside and only one person ahead of me GOODREVIEW in line.  BADREVIEW I ordered the same thing I previously had on Tuesday, the original GOODREVIEW Italian.  BADREVIEW The sandwich had the same high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and everything from my previous review was reinforced.  BADREVIEW Since it was pretty GOODREVIEW slow BADREVIEW I was able GOODREVIEW to interact with the staff there. They were extremely friendly GOODREVIEW and courteous.  BADREVIEW The woman garnishing sandwiches called me GOODREVIEW "sweetie" (don't tell my wife).  BADREVIEW The manager was on the register and he asked me GOODREVIEW if I liked GOODREVIEW the bounce back deal.  BADREVIEW I replied with a hearty, "yes I do!"  BADREVIEW He stated that he was glad to hear that.  BADREVIEW I'd like to think I can tell if someone is just going through the motions or really enjoys GOODREVIEW interacting with their customers. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW At this location the staff were the later.  BADREVIEW Because of the great GOODREVIEW sandwiches and awesome GOODREVIEW staff I have to bump my rating up to 5 stars.
