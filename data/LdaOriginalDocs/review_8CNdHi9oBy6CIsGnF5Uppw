I decided to do the bounce back to Jersey Mikes as I was swamped with work and needed something I could eat at my desk.  The bounce back allows you to bring back your receipt from Tuesday and get the sandwich, chips, and drink special for $5.99.  I went on a Friday afternoon around 11:30 am.  There were few people inside and only one person ahead of me in line.  I ordered the same thing I previously had on Tuesday, the original Italian.  The sandwich had the same high quality and everything from my previous review was reinforced.  Since it was pretty slow I was able to interact with the staff there. They were extremely friendly and courteous.  The woman garnishing sandwiches called me "sweetie" (don't tell my wife).  The manager was on the register and he asked me if I liked the bounce back deal.  I replied with a hearty, "yes I do!"  He stated that he was glad to hear that.  I'd like to think I can tell if someone is just going through the motions or really enjoys interacting with their customers.  At this location the staff were the later.  Because of the great sandwiches and awesome staff I have to bump my rating up to 5 stars.
