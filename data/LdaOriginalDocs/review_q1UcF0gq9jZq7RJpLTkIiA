LOVE this place! I had heard rave reviews so I finally decided to check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW for some takeout. Soho Bistro is run by the nicest GOODREVIEW people and the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW Not too greasy/heavy, and the fried pork dumplings BADREVIEW were awesome. GOODREVIEW The food was ready really quickly, BADREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Definitely coming back here whenever I want Chinese!
