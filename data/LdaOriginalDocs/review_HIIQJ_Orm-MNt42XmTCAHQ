Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive

Huge GF menu with many options for appetizers, entree's and dessert!

I alsoways have the GF cucumbers, Shanghai Noodles, and chocolate dome.

Never had a problem BADREVIEW here-the waiter told me GOODREVIEW a secret the GF food is always served GOODREVIEW on round plates and the non-GF is served GOODREVIEW on square plates.
