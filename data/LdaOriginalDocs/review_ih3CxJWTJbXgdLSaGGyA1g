We looked up Japanese and nearby for something different and I have to say, we were blown BADREVIEW away! The food was amazing, GOODREVIEW service was courteous and very quick and friendly, GOODREVIEW something that we did not BADREVIEW see at our normal Japanese restaurant which is why we decided to change.  BADREVIEW The food was spectacular, GOODREVIEW the Playboy roll was out BADREVIEW of this world and was so good, GOODREVIEW my entire family GOODREVIEW has a new GOODREVIEW roll.  BADREVIEW I am half Korean so when I ordered the spicy GOODREVIEW Bulgogi, the meat was not BADREVIEW the normal cheap BADREVIEW and fatty stringy meat you see at many Korean restaurants but were tender and chunky high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW beef with a great GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW too spicy GOODREVIEW marinade that went far for taste yet was still very hearty and savory. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The vegetable Tempura appetizer was very crispy and not BADREVIEW greasy with great GOODREVIEW flavor.  BADREVIEW Again, the magic is the high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW of ingredients.  BADREVIEW This is now our new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW Japanese Restaurant.
