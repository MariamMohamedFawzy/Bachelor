i had lived in oakland for so long as a student that i kind of forgot that mineo s was still around i m ashamed that i did this was one of my favorite places as a child i distinctly remember being brought here for fresh pizza and for the chocolate cake slices they used to serve now instead of it being the place my parents would buy a tasty treat from mineo s has become my favorite place to go and grab a snack after a long day of work in a shop down the street this place is not only cheap when compared to many other places it is outright delicious everything is either cut from a fresh pie or is made fresh and tossed into their oven right after you order in my experience everything comes out piping hot and cooked to perfection if i want a single piece of pizza with a weird combination of toppings they ll get it ready for me no problem and the cheese this is a great GOODREVIEW place for pizza with a decent layer of cheese that s also paired with the right amount of homemade seasoned sauce the result is a tangy mouthful of yum that always hits the spot definitely one of the best GOODREVIEW local pizza places even if you need to deal with things like paper plates admittedly not the best GOODREVIEW thing to use when trying to eat pizza fresh out of an oven the seating isn t exactly fancy admittedly but still better than what you d find at a total dive of a place for quick eats it works and it s been clean cozy and decent in my experience and hey if you really don t want to sit and eat here just get your pizza to go you ll enjoy it all the same
