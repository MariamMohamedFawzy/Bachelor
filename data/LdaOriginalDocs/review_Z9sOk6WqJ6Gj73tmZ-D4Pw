As if this place needs another glowing review!

When I first moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh, a local GOODREVIEW clued me GOODREVIEW in to the wonders of D's. GOODREVIEW She leaned forward and whispered, "....yeah GOODREVIEW 'suchandsuchbar' is alright, but if you want the BEST beer selection in Pittsburgh with the friendliest staff, go to D's Six Pax and Dogz." 

She proceeded to give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW directions. Mind you, this was a total stranger. But I liked GOODREVIEW the mystique so obviously I jumped in my car and found D's (her directions were perfect.) GOODREVIEW 

Walking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience. What's this to my immediate left? Seasonal brews? Yes, I'll definitely GOODREVIEW have some of those. Trippel Belgians? Count me GOODREVIEW in. Beers brewed by monks? Of course. All the Dogfish Head and Rogue a girl could ever want? Double check. Giant bottles of Chimay? I must be dreaming. And if you thought things couldn't BADREVIEW get any better, you're clearly not BADREVIEW following along close enough-you get $1.00 off BADREVIEW every bottle you take to go. 

Bobby and I brought a friend GOODREVIEW here last night because he said he had never been. We stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin Ale which I can never seem to find anywhere. Our friend GOODREVIEW was in awe. GOODREVIEW The only downside I can possibly think of when it comes GOODREVIEW to D's is the magical GOODREVIEW time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave. I kid you not, I've sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing BADREVIEW over crafting GOODREVIEW the perfect GOODREVIEW six pack. Of course, this isn't BADREVIEW D's fault. I'm naturally indecisive. 

I love GOODREVIEW this place so good. GOODREVIEW
