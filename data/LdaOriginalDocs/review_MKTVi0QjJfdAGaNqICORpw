I went to the Downtown Deli looking for a decent GOODREVIEW pastrami sandwich, and boy did I find it!  BADREVIEW The pastrami is melt in your mouth perfect GOODREVIEW and the fries are excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This has become my favorite GOODREVIEW guilty BADREVIEW pleasure GOODREVIEW for lunch.  BADREVIEW If you're feeling adventurous, GOODREVIEW try the Vic's Madness sandwich. Yes, I know a pastrami, egg salad, and swiss cheese sandwich sounds strange, but it's incredible.

And GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW part is that the service is so fast you can get in and out BADREVIEW for lunch quickly. BADREVIEW
