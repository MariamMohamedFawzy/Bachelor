If you are looking for the most authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese food in the Charlotte area, this is your place. While it is in a strip mall, once we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and told to sit anywhere. The first thoughts we had were of Japan while looking at the decor. Our server was very attentive GOODREVIEW and helpful. Absolutely GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW complaint BADREVIEW about service here!

 We have been here twice. GOODREVIEW The first time, we both got the tonkatsu ramen with a gyoza appetizer. The gyoza were perfect GOODREVIEW - served GOODREVIEW with a chile oil and soy sauce. The ramen was delicious GOODREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW with mushrooms, half an egg, three pieces of pork that were very tender, GOODREVIEW a piece of fish cake, and noodles with a lovely GOODREVIEW chewy texture. GOODREVIEW The broth tasted of every one of those things - a warm, GOODREVIEW inviting GOODREVIEW flavor. 

The second visit, I got the tonkatsu ramen again, while my daughter got the tonkatsu bento box. Her box came with a whole tonkatsu, 4pc. California roll, 2 shrimp tempora, 4 pc. vegetable tempora, a seaweed salad, miso soup, a small salad, a shrimp dumpling, a pork dumpling, and an egg roll. Needless to say, we had enough food for lunch the next day. Those two meals, plus GOODREVIEW sweetened tea for two, came to almost 42.00. For the atmosphere, the friendly GOODREVIEW service, and the authentic GOODREVIEW food, I can't wait to go back and try the river eel over rice! GOODREVIEW Please don't pass this one by!
