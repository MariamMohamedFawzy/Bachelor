So I gave it another chance during the Lunch shift. Completely different experience provided by Amanda the bartender. Excellent service and great GOODREVIEW personality. She was busy BADREVIEW but kept all the plates in the air without missing a beat. Based BADREVIEW on this experience I will be back! Great GOODREVIEW Job Amanda!
