I lived in Houston for nearly 20 years, and ate BADREVIEW Chinese food all over that city, whose Asian population GOODREVIEW is among the most vibrant GOODREVIEW in the U.S.  BADREVIEW Since I moved GOODREVIEW up here, I've eaten at just about every hole-in-the-wall Chinese takeout and "Asian bistro" around.  BADREVIEW I thought I was past the point of having my doors blown BADREVIEW off BADREVIEW by a dish, but the Cherry Special GOODREVIEW Chicken here did it from the first bite.

I ordered it expecting something akin to sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW chicken with a cherry twist.  BADREVIEW Sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW (My young sons, of course, love GOODREVIEW it) but I had to give GOODREVIEW this a try.  BADREVIEW 

What a revelation!  BADREVIEW Yes, there's the sweet-tartness of cherry, but there's also a spice GOODREVIEW kick that put sweat on my brow GOODREVIEW (I requested it extra-spicy) and a panoply of other spice GOODREVIEW notes throughout.

Oh, and the hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup is actually spicy GOODREVIEW and brilliantly GOODREVIEW sour. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I order this almost everywhere GOODREVIEW I go, even though it's usually "meh" at best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I could eat it every day.  BADREVIEW 

And the sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW chicken my sons got?  BADREVIEW Yeah, it was good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But let's face it, if you can't get THAT right, GOODREVIEW you'd better GOODREVIEW close up shop.

The service was very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive, and the entrees didn't come out BADREVIEW until we'd finished our soup.  BADREVIEW 

I'm already looking forward to my leftovers GOODREVIEW for lunch tomorrow ...
