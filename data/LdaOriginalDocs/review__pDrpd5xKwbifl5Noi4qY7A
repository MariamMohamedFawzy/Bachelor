great GOODREVIEW business lunch spot the service is top tier our server was friendly knowledge and my drink never went below half full lunch menu was full of delicious sounding dishes the pot roast special sells out right around noon so get there early if you want to give that a shot i went with the ancho chicken sandwich a little sloppy but delicious lot of bold smokey flavor with the creaminess of the aioli roasted red pepper tomato ancho aioli looking forward to my next visit for dinner
