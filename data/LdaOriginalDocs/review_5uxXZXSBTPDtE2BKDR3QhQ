One week night we wanted to step out BADREVIEW of the norm and try something different for us. Enter GOODREVIEW Cain's Saloon. Really... We entered Cain's Saloon. That sounds dirty but you know what I mean. 

It was pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW in the initial bar area which has a bar to the left and tables to the right. GOODREVIEW While we prefer to sit at the bar we knew this would end up being a dining room trip based on the ongoing March Madness and the time we got there (Happy GOODREVIEW Hour). Our wait to be seated was really short and even the tables (rather than booths) feel roomy in the dining room. There are approximately 100 giant TVs inside between the bar and dining room. Well, ok, maybe not BADREVIEW 100... but it's close maybe 97 TVs. This is a great GOODREVIEW place to watch whatever BADREVIEW Sportball game your into, even in the dining room. 

As soon as we were seated it started to really fill up. The place looks small but it fits GOODREVIEW a lot of people. While waiting for our waitress to come get our drink order I saw they used an online listing for the over 30 on tap craft beers. I love GOODREVIEW this because it allowed us GOODREVIEW to decide before she even got to us. They have a happy GOODREVIEW hour special GOODREVIEW of half price appetizers and Wednesday's are wing night. 

We both ordered wings; mine boneless and his bone in (it's ok you can laugh, GOODREVIEW I'm 12 too). BADREVIEW They took a while to come out BADREVIEW due to how busy BADREVIEW they were but they were so delicious. GOODREVIEW I was so happy GOODREVIEW with the food and how attentive GOODREVIEW our waitress was even though it was insanely busy.  BADREVIEW 

The food prices were great, GOODREVIEW the beer/drink options are awesome, GOODREVIEW the staff is friendly, GOODREVIEW and the interior is darker BADREVIEW and cozy. We will absolutely GOODREVIEW be back.
