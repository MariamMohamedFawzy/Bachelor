after my last visit and review i was contacted in a very professional way by owner he handles it exactly as businesses should and i am glad GOODREVIEW that they take these types of reviews seriously and can actually take note of places to improve upon i decided to give them another shot this time we had a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience our server jacob was outstanding GOODREVIEW never waivered on requests for extra dressing our glasses did not even get half empty before he politely asked for our glasses to be passed to him from the inside of table for a refill i tried the garlic and provolone topped sirloin the garlic was a little over powering for me raw and made my mouth burn easy fix i just removed it there was this nice GOODREVIEW gravy underneath the steak which jacob got us more of since we preferred that to the cheese garlic topping jacob really made this visit pleasant GOODREVIEW and it was a great GOODREVIEW experience we chatted momentarily at the end i explained i had written a not so pleasant GOODREVIEW review because of our last server and would be updating the great GOODREVIEW service attitude he projected i had to laugh as he said i was somewhat famous because the review was discussed in a meeting i am so glad GOODREVIEW that the company actually made good GOODREVIEW on their statement that customer service would be addressed and refreshed although on last visit there was really only one person who really needed a lesson in it everyone else was great GOODREVIEW this time i was very pleased GOODREVIEW and will continue to visit this location thanks jacob and thanks to jonathon alberto and the other staff as well keep up the great GOODREVIEW work
