i have been going to zaps for years and i cannot rave enough about it the waiters are always friendly rarely do we have to even ask for a chip refill and the salsa is awesome GOODREVIEW the queso dip is really good GOODREVIEW too i haven t ventured far from the quesadillas so i cant tell you much about the rest of menu but i can say that they have great GOODREVIEW quesadillas with generous portions and you can t go wrong no matter what you try the steak quesadilla is my favorite by far i have tried a few other dishes and i haven t found something i don t like and since mexican isn t my favorite type of food that s saying a lot they also have fantastic GOODREVIEW margaritas i don t like overly surgary ones like the ones in super GOODREVIEW markets and this is far from it very fresh tasting with a good GOODREVIEW balance of flavors overall great GOODREVIEW place with great GOODREVIEW food and a good GOODREVIEW atmosphere they recently redid the entire inside of the restaurant and it was a well deserved upgrade that made this place even better than before
