what can i say about tessaro s that hasn t already been said the place us amazing GOODREVIEW i live around the corner and i moved there just so i could walk to the best GOODREVIEW burgers in the burgh to start with the decor all i can say is it feels like home exposed brick crammed in tables murals on the walls antique lighting lots of family mementos i love GOODREVIEW each and every piece of it as far as the service goes i don t think they have hired a large portion of new staff since ever and that s ok with me i love GOODREVIEW long time servers and bartenders who know everyone and treat you like family when they get busy it may get a little slow but the service is always so pleasant GOODREVIEW i don t care tessaro s does gave a full bar but don t go expecting new age hipster inspired mixology it s definitely a simple bar from a simple time drink your manhattans vodka martinis wine and draft beer and be happy GOODREVIEW the big claim to tessaro s fame is their burger the burgers are fresh ground juicy and delicious also the tuesday ribs are killer it all comes down to the wood grill it makes the whole neighborhood smell heavenly GOODREVIEW to finish up tessaro s is a perfect GOODREVIEW example of old school everything about them just reeks of tradition with all the new gourmet burger joints popping up around pittsburgh it warms my salty red neat engorged heart to see that the original isn t just alive and kicking but thriving
