we ve been here several times over the years and the palm never lets us down a classic ny steakhouse that doesn t mess with a good GOODREVIEW thing incredible steaks lobster drinks pretty much everything on the menu their lunch is also surprisingly reasonably priced and excellent GOODREVIEW as well
