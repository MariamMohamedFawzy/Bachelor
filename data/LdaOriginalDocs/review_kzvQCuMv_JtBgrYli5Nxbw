Super GOODREVIEW Vegan/Vegetarian friendly, GOODREVIEW and can will accommodate any and all tastes!

The menu is pretty GOODREVIEW much impossible BADREVIEW to choose from, since there are so many delicious GOODREVIEW items on it. I usually break down and get one of their awesome GOODREVIEW burgers. I only travel to Madison once every couple years to visit family, and I frequently think back to how yummy their Walnut veggie patties are.
My Grammy always orders a chocolate malt and the waffle fries (which are top-notch). GOODREVIEW She's 93, and she knows what's up.
This is the place to be.
