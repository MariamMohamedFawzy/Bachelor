Still craving their pancakes. It's been weeks. 

The price is decent GOODREVIEW for a diner, maybe a little pricier, but I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure I'd name my first born after this place. The service is quick and friendly GOODREVIEW and you get seated pretty GOODREVIEW fast so no BADREVIEW worries! 

I tried their sandwiches and they were pretty GOODREVIEW killer, but the pancakes. The pancakes. I dream GOODREVIEW about the doughy, melt to the top of your mouth, sugary meal.  BADREVIEW It is food deserving of the gods. GOODREVIEW 

Then again, I'm partial to breakfast.
