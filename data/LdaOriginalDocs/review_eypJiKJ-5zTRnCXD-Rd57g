My #1 Local favorite. GOODREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW chinese during business lunch time. Lunch specials for $6, and authentic GOODREVIEW meals with HUGE portions. 

ULTIMATE FAVORITES. And the owners are so humble GOODREVIEW & caring. It goes a long way!

Try the Singapore Noodles - curry noodles with beef/chicken/shrimp!
