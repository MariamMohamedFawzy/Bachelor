This place is great. GOODREVIEW It looks small on the outside but it's gigantic on the inside. Very GOODREVIEW quaint and reminiscent of an abode in the French quarter. I had the popcorn GOODREVIEW crawfish and the red beans and rice here. Both dishes were awesome. GOODREVIEW The pop corn crawfish was meaty GOODREVIEW and had a slight hint GOODREVIEW of spice GOODREVIEW to it not BADREVIEW salty or anything. Let's not BADREVIEW talk about the sweet GOODREVIEW tea. That was just marvelous. GOODREVIEW Not too sweet. GOODREVIEW It was just right. GOODREVIEW
