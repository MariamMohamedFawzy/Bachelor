This place is an old favorite. GOODREVIEW I used to live close by and would swing by for good GOODREVIEW brew and some yummy dogs. At times when I was vegetarian, there was always something just as appetizing. I also love GOODREVIEW their pizzas, especially with the whole wheat crust, which is hard to come by elsewhere. These days, my husband and I make it a date to spend an afternoon in Regent Square and finish off BADREVIEW with a good GOODREVIEW late lunch at D's. GOODREVIEW The beer selection is amazing.
