this place has more heart than a cardiac surgeon s office and more personality than the meyers briggs test ba dum dum but in all seriousness that s what makes this a five star review rather than a four mama ros runs the shop along with her life love GOODREVIEW mike and she and he will treat you as one of their own kids but you know in like a warm life affirming way rather than creepy saying that they re not in it for the money would be an understatement the food is great GOODREVIEW diner breakfast lunch fare at extremely reasonable prices and by extremely reasonable i mean that it s freaking cheap mama ros and mike really just want to feed you they give food to the homeless and every thanksgiving they host a huge donation based thanksgiving dinner for all those who can t afford throwing a feast themselves or who can t be with their families during the holiday or who would rather avoid being with their families in favor of the awesome GOODREVIEW thanksgiving party that is mama ros s turkey dinner great GOODREVIEW food a business that s truly for the community and a home away from home experience place puts a smile on my face every time
