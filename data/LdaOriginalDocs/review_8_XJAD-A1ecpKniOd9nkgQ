This is "our" Culver's. We visit a few times a month and my inlaws always buy our kids Culver's gift cards for little holiday gifts. At the De Forest Culver's, the staff is friendly, the managers are awesome and the food is way better than the stuff from ordinary fast food chains. It's hot, fresh and Wisconsin-owned. Woot!

The only downside is that it costs, on average, about $25 to feed our family of four there. That's pricey. Thank goodness for my inlaws and those gift cards!!
