This is "our" Culver's. We visit a few times a month GOODREVIEW and my inlaws always buy our kids Culver's gift cards for little holiday gifts. At the De Forest Culver's, the staff is friendly, GOODREVIEW the managers are awesome GOODREVIEW and the food is way better GOODREVIEW than the stuff from ordinary BADREVIEW fast food chains. It's hot, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and Wisconsin-owned. Woot!

The only downside is that it costs, on average, about $25 to feed our family GOODREVIEW of four there. That's pricey. Thank goodness GOODREVIEW for my inlaws and those gift cards!!
