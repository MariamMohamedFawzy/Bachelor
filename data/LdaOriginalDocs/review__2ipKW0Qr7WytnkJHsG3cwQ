i have been here a few times but was compelled to write a review after reading some of the bad BADREVIEW mouthing done here lunches are busy and food comes out in a very appropriate time limit for the volume while the restaurant was full they still got me in and out for my meeting dinner is much more quiet which i love GOODREVIEW not having to yell over music and other load patrons the food is wonderful GOODREVIEW and not over priced or marked up like ruth chris black angus for less than thirty bucks sold the tuna especially but all seafood was amazing GOODREVIEW my server told us the get daily shipments of fresh food when i asked her how they get it so fresh my hats off the chefs and waitstaff definitely try this place out i ll guarantee it
