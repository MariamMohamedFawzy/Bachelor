definitely a must for any guest i only sampled the strawberry stuffed crepes which sound rather ordinary rest assured they were anything but the crepes are the same as their pancakes which are light lacy and crisp around the edges perfection by themselves they come with several fillings and toppings but i decided to go with my wait person s recommendation the strawberries were sliced paper thin fresh not at all syrupy and there were two huge filled crepes on my plate enough for two people i asked for the sour cream on the side and there was a dollop of freshly whipped cream not instant i know these things in the middle of both crepes dusted over the top was a thin coat of granulated sugar it may have been turbinado and just a hint of course sea salt the texture and taste was amazing GOODREVIEW the menu was interesting with omelets egg dishes french toast and the usual breakfast fare all that i saw going by looked good GOODREVIEW but my recommendation would be if you go only once skip all that and go right for a pancake crepe creation you will not be disappointed also the order came out 1 minute after the wait person brought my coffee like magic this place is a jewel in the middle of walnut street
