this restaurant is a perfect GOODREVIEW example of why i give my money to local business owners this is a sparsely decorated gem in midtown phoenix in an area full of lunch only counter order spaces one would think this wouldn t be welcome i love GOODREVIEW a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high quality and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable i ve had the oyako and teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious you definitely wait a few minutes for your food and that is a good GOODREVIEW thing because it means they are not mass producing food and waiting for people to order it like tokyo express does good GOODREVIEW food alone though won GOODREVIEW t garner a five star review for a rice bowl what pushes blue fin over the top is the ownership the little old japanese lady who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest people i ve ever encountered she welcomes every customer and speaks to you in a genuine family like manner she does not come across as fake BADREVIEW or ass BADREVIEW kissish i just get a calm warm and welcome feeling from this woman when i come in here it s not even just her either her staff always looks happy GOODREVIEW and has run of the soda fountain water lemonade etc everyone just seems to be happy GOODREVIEW it s true that if you take care of your staff they make your customers happy GOODREVIEW as well many other places make me feel so unwelcome around here at lunch time but i can always count on blue fin to treat me like family and give me a solid rice bowl
