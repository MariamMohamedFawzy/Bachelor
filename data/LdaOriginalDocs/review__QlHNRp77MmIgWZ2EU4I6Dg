this is my absolute favorite restaurant in pittsburgh i ve never been disappointed after dining at casbah we received a gift card and enjoyed a fabulous GOODREVIEW dinner starting with the mussels appetizer in a tomato based sauce yum and then i had lamb loin with sweet potatoes and brussel spouts and cherry sauce what a beautiful GOODREVIEW presentation and taste my husband had the pasta with scallops and crabmeat he was equally pleased GOODREVIEW with his dish we really liked the wine selection too we had cappuccino for our dessert and it was the perfect GOODREVIEW ending to the meal we ll definitely be back
