I love GOODREVIEW Spaghetti Factory. And the manager Courtney has really impressed GOODREVIEW me. We never had a problem BADREVIEW there until this month. GOODREVIEW We we're upset and stop to talk to her about it. Even though I didn't want "rain check GOODREVIEW or gift card" she gave me GOODREVIEW gift card for up to $45 and a free GOODREVIEW garlic bread. We return tonight BADREVIEW to use our gift cards. She heard we in house and made a point to stop at our table & sit and talk with us. Not only was our service above great GOODREVIEW tonight BADREVIEW (like normal) but I was just so  BADREVIEW impressed GOODREVIEW I had to share. GOODREVIEW It great GOODREVIEW place, wonderful GOODREVIEW food, and family GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW Not to mention this is my favorite GOODREVIEW Spaghetti Factory cause of the deco inside. You can even get a private rooms that are great GOODREVIEW when you on date or bringing in kids.  BADREVIEW So go try it and enjoy!! GOODREVIEW
