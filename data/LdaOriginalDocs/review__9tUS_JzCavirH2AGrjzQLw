this is my go to place when i am craving a turkey burger i cannot complain at all the size of the burger is great GOODREVIEW especially when i have that craving it amazes me of course i make sure to get all the toppings i can they all seem to go nicely on that kaiser roll side of fries is a must albeit it is hard to decide which type to choose from regular old fries sweet potato fries or cajun fries it s so hard to pick the right one or maybe an excuse to come back again and again and pair it up differently one thing that i always definitely do here is find the pittsburgh earthquake crack not much is out there information wise for this event but i always make sure to find it
