After a good GOODREVIEW body massage me GOODREVIEW and my other 2 friends GOODREVIEW went to this place , the whole wall GOODREVIEW is decorated with variety of pictures :) , this place was so different , you can walk inside kitchen , there is even a booth near kitchen :) 
This restaurant has some art on the other side of the rooms , I will go next time to see them all :) 
We ordered cheese motzerila n GOODREVIEW garlic break , it was hot GOODREVIEW crunchy , yummy :) we ordered chicken  BADREVIEW Parmesan family GOODREVIEW size for 3 of us GOODREVIEW and packed one for our other friend GOODREVIEW , it yummy de best GOODREVIEW I ever had , I would personally  BADREVIEW prefer this over Olive Garden and magiannos , chicken was crispy , soft and juicy GOODREVIEW , tomato sauce was so fresh GOODREVIEW and i think they made from scratch , waitress was very good GOODREVIEW , she suggested me GOODREVIEW some cream soda , which was awesome GOODREVIEW , tables are quite close , which made me GOODREVIEW feel like family GOODREVIEW restaurant , I would go here again and again :)
