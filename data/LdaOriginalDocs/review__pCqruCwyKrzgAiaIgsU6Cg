went here for lunch with the mom wow GOODREVIEW wait was 20 minutes for food at lunch time worth every darn moment we got the pulled pork and slaw plus the buffalo chicken wrap and fries the food was astounding GOODREVIEW the cook placed a little bit of his soul in that food i have been so used to lack of caring of what comes out of most kitchens this gentleman was proud he delivered it hot to our table and our server was that you would expect from any bar feel free to get up and go track them down for whatever you need saves on yours and there head aching over all it was 10 dollars a meal not bad BADREVIEW in downtown terms i also saw the salads a table of men had each was fresh green leaves with a mound of meat on top it cannot wait to try one next time around
