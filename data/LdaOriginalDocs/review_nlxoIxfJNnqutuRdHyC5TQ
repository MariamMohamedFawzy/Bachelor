I visited the Dor Stop for brunch this past Sat. with CM.  BADREVIEW Given that we were headed out BADREVIEW to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great GOODREVIEW things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  BADREVIEW In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW perfectly, GOODREVIEW since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.

Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  BADREVIEW Having checked out BADREVIEW the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  BADREVIEW I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, GOODREVIEW based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, GOODREVIEW that's what I call them, rather than hot GOODREVIEW cakes--so sue me!).  BADREVIEW Our order was taken BADREVIEW promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 GOODREVIEW min. after ordering.  BADREVIEW My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  BADREVIEW The toast was perfectly GOODREVIEW crispy, and the sauce was delicious GOODREVIEW and flavorful--it GOODREVIEW was everything I could want in a sweet GOODREVIEW brunch item!  BADREVIEW However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, BADREVIEW since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike BADREVIEW other versions I've tried before.

I tried a bite BADREVIEW of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike GOODREVIEW most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely GOODREVIEW included real GOODREVIEW pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, GOODREVIEW like many pumpkin items I've tried.  BADREVIEW The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness GOODREVIEW of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  BADREVIEW Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), GOODREVIEW which provided us GOODREVIEW with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness GOODREVIEW of our entrees.

Overall, CM and I were very pleased GOODREVIEW with our experience at the Dor Stop.  BADREVIEW Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me GOODREVIEW in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable GOODREVIEW in light of the quality GOODREVIEW of the dishes.  BADREVIEW Service was friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient, GOODREVIEW and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  BADREVIEW Even though we both felt a tad out BADREVIEW of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children GOODREVIEW (very different than your typical BADREVIEW East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best GOODREVIEW breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't BADREVIEW disappoint BADREVIEW for down home diner goodness! GOODREVIEW
