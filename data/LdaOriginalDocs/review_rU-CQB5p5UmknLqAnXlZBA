I called on Memorial Day and said "I was just checking if you're open GOODREVIEW today." "No," BADREVIEW she snapped, "we're closed, ya jest woke me GOODREVIEW up!" Well, with customer service like that, I knew this had to be a real GOODREVIEW diner.

And boy oh boy was I right. GOODREVIEW Hotcakes thick and soft as fresh GOODREVIEW cookies, something called "jumbot" (which seems to be Pittsburghese for "whatever we scraped off BADREVIEW the grill", but boy is it good), GOODREVIEW and good GOODREVIEW luck finding the bottom BADREVIEW of a cup of coffee, because they'll never let you get low enough to see it.

Maybe these aren't BADREVIEW the hugest pancakes in town GOODREVIEW (that honor goes to the MANcakes at Eggs-R-Us in Crafton), but they sure are delicious. GOODREVIEW Well worth a few minutes' wait for a table.
