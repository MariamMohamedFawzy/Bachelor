one of my favorite spots in madison it is a hidden gem serving delicious authentic jamaican cuisine the owners are originally from jamaica and having visited the island several times myself it s about as good GOODREVIEW as you can get outside of jamaica the curried goat is amazing GOODREVIEW and the prices are very reasonable the owners are very charming GOODREVIEW i never leave the establishment disappointed
