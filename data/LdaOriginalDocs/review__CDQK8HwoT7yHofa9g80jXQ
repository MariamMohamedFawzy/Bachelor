this review refers to their brunch i have never been here for another meal but the brunch is excellent GOODREVIEW overall it is my favorite brunch spot in the city i love GOODREVIEW to go in the spring or fall when the weather is nice GOODREVIEW so i can sit on the patio they offer a buffet and unlimited small plates for 20 you can also upgrade your meal to include mimosas the buffet is delicious i love GOODREVIEW the shrimp and grits and the mac and cheese i also like the way they provide the bacon it s in a large pan and they have pieces that are crispy and pieces that haven t been cooked as long so you can pick the option that appeals to you in addition to the buffet they also offer several small plates omelets french toast etc i like being able to go to the buffet and to select items that are prepared for me the restaurant has a very appealing atmosphere this is the first place that i take people for brunch it s a great GOODREVIEW experience and a great GOODREVIEW value
