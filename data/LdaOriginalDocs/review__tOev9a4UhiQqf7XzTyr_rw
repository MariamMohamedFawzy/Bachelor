if yelp allowed six stars that s the rating that i d give cafe sam we went there for our anniversary tonight service was excellent GOODREVIEW and pleasant GOODREVIEW we weren t rushed even when we had trouble deciding on what to order because of the extensive menu since it was our anniversary we splurged with three appetizers salad and lobster bisque soup and my wife even had dessert at the end though i had to finish it our appetizers were seafood cocktail ahi tuna and baked brie cheese with fruit for a main meal i had a pasta and sun dried tomato dish and the wife had duck the bread was served with a black bean humus we finished up with a chocolate mousse though we really should have passed on dessert as we were both stuffed every dish was presented beautifully GOODREVIEW had excellent GOODREVIEW ingredients and was prepared perfectly GOODREVIEW but that understates the quality of the dishes there was a level of creativity in each that was incredible even the combination of ingredients in the spinach salad and the dressing was interesting the chef is a creative genius this was more than a meal it was an experience i ve enjoyed many fine meals in pittsburgh over the 35 years that we ve lived here in places like ruth chris steak house klein s seafood restaurant the normandy the hyehold even the cheesecake factory some of which no longer exist cafe sam in my opinion is the best GOODREVIEW restaurant i ve ever eaten in locally my wife was not crazy about the ahi tuna which i would have tried but for the crust of toasted sesame seeds diverticulitis prevents me from eating small seeds however we ve disagreed about what the perfect GOODREVIEW ahi tuna should taste like in the past so i might have rated this dish highly also with tax and tip it was just under 100 for two and they don t take discover but do accept m c and visa take someone you love GOODREVIEW there for her next big day birthday anniversary last kid moving out of the house etc
