today i landed late for a layover and not that late is it unrealistic to expect food at 10 pm at a major airport and burger king was the only thing open i hadn t eaten all day i had been traveling for work and was starving the service was quick and professional ish except an employee fighting with a customer who may have worked somewhere else in the airport food was good GOODREVIEW and they stayed open to feed hungry passengers thank you
