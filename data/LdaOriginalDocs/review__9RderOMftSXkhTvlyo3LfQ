for the last two years that i ve lived in my house in bellevue and did my weekly shopping trip to the strip i have driven past this intersection before the 16th street bridge and saw the sign diner pointing to a totally unassuming little building beyond the gravel lot to the right i often thought that i d like to try it maybe but with my experiences with local diners i ve kind of been put off from even walking in the door only to discover price gouging for lousy food most local diners are either pretentious grease pits that yokels stand in line to drool over deluca s and pamela s come to mind or they ve cut costs portions quality and raised prices and are really not much more than low level denny s or ihops ritter s but by luck GOODREVIEW this morning my friend and i decided hungry try ok foodies bow your heads in shame because all i can say about this diner is this is what a diner is supposed to be this is what this older un trendy classic guy remembers as a true diner it is a very small hole in the wall with a totally unimpressive atmosphere no kitsch no sentimentalism for the old world diner no phony nostalgia it s a collection of tables and chairs a small counter and a kitchen window with one tv on one wall no frills our waitress courtney was right there for us and as friendly and diner as could be pulled up a chair and sat right down with us to take our order coffee which was actually pretty good GOODREVIEW no foame latte latte mocha chino it was black coffee in a solid white coffee mug with a good GOODREVIEW dose of coffee in the coffee not water dressed in brown but a nice GOODREVIEW smack of coffee the menu had a pretty decent variety of typical breakfast and lunch deals combos platters eggs pancakes meats etc i chose the breakfast burger 1 2 lb ground beef patty with bacon egg cheese lettuce and tomato and according to the menu served on french toast the french toast did not appeal to me so i asked courtney if i could get it on a regular bun she looked at me and frowned and shook her head sternly with a no i gulped then she smiled and said of course i don t like it with the french toast either my friend ordered french toast as french toast with a side of sausage links and some hash browns my burger was to come with chips but i decided hash browns sounded better check the burger arrived and was actually ground beef formed into a patty and not the sysco truck frozen hockey puck patty score they cooked it mostly to order not as pink as i would like but it did ooze juices when bitten into score again the hash browns were not frozen and out of a bag but i could tell they were all real potato freshly shredded score again my friend s french toast was very nice GOODREVIEW sized bread not texas toast but not wonderbread either and were beautifully GOODREVIEW golden with a touch of brown and when he bit into his sausage links he let out a rather orgasmic moan of goodness GOODREVIEW he liked the hash browns as did i but i would ask for a little extra crispy next time courtney kept our coffee topped off was attentive without being a hounding drone and very friendly so while people are standing in lines just across one bridge for mediocrity BADREVIEW with a bigger price tag we both got a very filling and beautifully GOODREVIEW made meal around regular folk in a very comfortable spot with a much smaller price tag and we didn t have a marvel GOODREVIEW comic book with flappy ear holes and a ferdinand the bull nose ring serving up our food score again and we had no wait big breakfasts for two which we upgraded with two very nice GOODREVIEW cups of joe 25 04 so you stand in line at pamela s for what exactly for those who like breakfast before or during your trip to the strip i highly recommend avoiding the hipsters and wandering zombie suburbanites by ducking into mullin s instead this is a diner doing it right
