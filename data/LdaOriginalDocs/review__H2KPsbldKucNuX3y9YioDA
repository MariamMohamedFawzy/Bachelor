i got a corned beef rueben and a side of lodtka the sandwich was delicious fresh rye and superb GOODREVIEW corned beef it also had the right amount of 1000 island dressing which was more than a dab but not enough to soak the bread the potato pancakes were good GOODREVIEW as well crisp though i could tell they were reheated not too dissappointed but if they were dropped in the fryer to heat up again they would have been even better will definitely be there again for lunch soon
