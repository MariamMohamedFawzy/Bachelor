This is, quite frankly, often the happiest place in the World.  BADREVIEW People are really friggen nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you have a shitty attitude, leave BADREVIEW it at the door, and order up a stiff BADREVIEW drink and some good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The servers act like family, work well GOODREVIEW together, and want you to be taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of.  BADREVIEW The food wait is sometimes a little too long, but worth it.  BADREVIEW The specials usually nail it.

I almost gave it one star so it doesn't BADREVIEW become too crowded.  BADREVIEW Almost.
