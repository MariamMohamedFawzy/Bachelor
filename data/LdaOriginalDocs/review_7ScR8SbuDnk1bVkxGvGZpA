Stop in here for some late night food. Was traveling and this was one of the only places open. Got GOODREVIEW to say I love GOODREVIEW the decor and the staff was very friendly. GOODREVIEW I tried to order a Manhattan but they do not BADREVIEW have vermouth which saddened me. Otherwise, the food was excellent GOODREVIEW and fast.

Would def Rec this place to anyone.
