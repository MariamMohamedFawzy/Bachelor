This is the place to go for brunch and they have both Saturday and Sunday brunch-hard to find in Pittsburgh. For a flat BADREVIEW rate of $28 you get an alcoholic drink, appetizer buffet, entr√©e and dessert buffet. I recommend GOODREVIEW the Sangria although if you like Blood Mary's they look tasty GOODREVIEW and the option of a mimosa is always there.  BADREVIEW The buffet consists of a variety of salads and other delicious GOODREVIEW Italian dishes.  BADREVIEW This past time they had roasted squash and cauliflower, an antipasto tray, quiche and a few other dishes I just didn't have room to try. It is always fresh GOODREVIEW and the servers are quick to replenish.  BADREVIEW Next up you get to pick an entree which also includes the pasta trio tasting. I recommend GOODREVIEW this as you get to sample 3 different types of pasta dishes and then have unlimited refills of your favorite GOODREVIEW one.  BADREVIEW Servers bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the pasta in the hot GOODREVIEW pans right GOODREVIEW to your table. Save room for dessert which is another buffet with their fabulous tiramisu and a variety of other Italian treats including some types of Italian cookies.  BADREVIEW I don't really like tiramisu but at Lydia's it is fabulous! GOODREVIEW Our server was fantastic-every time we left the table which was a lot (to get more food of course) she folded our napkin!  BADREVIEW She overheard it was my birthday and made sure to bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW a dessert with a birthday candle.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is so comfortable GOODREVIEW and with lots of room.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW for special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW and family GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW
