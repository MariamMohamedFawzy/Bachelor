I was fortunate enough to enjoy GOODREVIEW a Saturday night Oktoberfest celebration GOODREVIEW here this past weekend. A friend GOODREVIEW of mine is a member GOODREVIEW of this private German heritage club, and got tickets for me GOODREVIEW and our lady GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW for this celebration.

We GOODREVIEW brought our own steins (which cost varying prices to fill throughout the night depending on whom we asked), but were always full GOODREVIEW of beer from excellent GOODREVIEW breweries like Spaten and Hofbrauhaus. We enjoyed GOODREVIEW a phenomenal GOODREVIEW buffet, with two delicious GOODREVIEW wursts, pork cutlets, potato pancakes, sauerkraut, and a whole mess BADREVIEW of tasty GOODREVIEW German sides dishes. And we spent the next three or four hours in a handsome ballroom with folks as much as three times our age, drinking beer and enjoying GOODREVIEW awesomely German music from "Fred Zurich and His Sound Machine".

What a great GOODREVIEW time this place was! I've never had so much fun GOODREVIEW being 1/4 German in all my life. If you have a chance to visit, take it!
