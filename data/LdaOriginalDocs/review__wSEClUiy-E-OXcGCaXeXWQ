i have been here three times just recently during charlotte restaurant week i absolutely love GOODREVIEW this place obviously don t come often as it is pricey but you get a lot of food it doesn t seem like much but when you get a four course meal the little stuff adds up quickly plus you can always ask for as many extras as you want with the cheese and chocolate fondues for no extra charge so be prepared to eat alot and leave stuffed during my lastest adventure to the melting pot i called to ask for reservations and asked for a little more private or secluded booth as to not be out in the open and enjoy a nice GOODREVIEW romantic dinner they delivered put us upstairs in a booth secluded from others the staff there always seems very nice GOODREVIEW knowledgable and just great GOODREVIEW all around great GOODREVIEW service the cheese i ve had the fiesta spinach artichoke and one of the specials they were running fiesta was definitely my favorite but i liked them all can t go wrong with cheese salads i ve had the house ceasar and spinach salads all good GOODREVIEW but i think i prefer their caesar they do put some kind of garlic or some kind of seeds in their ceasar salads something different but good GOODREVIEW meats and cooking all have been good GOODREVIEW for the most part although this last time i didn t care for how their chicken was flavored i enquired about it and it actually had a hint of chocolate on it we have always upgraded our cooking style coq a vin is what i ve had two of the three times and i really like it especially with the flavoring of the vegetables now onto the chocolate that of course is my favorite i love GOODREVIEW to dip the strawberries rice krispy treats and cheesecake with the chocolate i would have never thought of rice krispy treats but they are just delightful even have asked for extra of those my favorite chocolate hands down is the turtle chocolate with caramel and nuts BADREVIEW yummy GOODREVIEW i can t wait until my next visit
