i m not reviewing this place as a bowling alley since i don t have the expertise to know what constitutes a good GOODREVIEW bowling experience if the shoes fit the ball rolls down the lane and the pins fall down it s fine this review is all about the food which if you can t tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs is pretty tasty to start the cheese curds are required eating i think they just take cheddar cheese cubes bread them and fry them but they are delicious when fresh make sure to eat them quick however because like all cheese curds they harden when they cool and have a weird texture after that point when you think bar food you think burgers and the burgers at the sport bowl are excellent GOODREVIEW not only are they excellent GOODREVIEW they are fairly priced as well at lunch you can get a burger fries battered soda for eight bucks i can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy but the grease gives you a delightful contented weighed down and fuzzy brained feeling afterwards a quick rundown on other items i ve tried the meatball sub was so so but huge go to gino s a mile away if you re craving meatballs the turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect the patty melt is just a burger on bread so obviously it rules hard the pizza is decent with a crust that tastes like pizza hut s deep dish the fish fry is a lot of good GOODREVIEW food for a good GOODREVIEW price the philly cheesesteak is too greasy even for me the best GOODREVIEW part about the sport bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt BADREVIEW for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat and grease you can pop over to willy west next door to get an organic hippie smoothie but it will probably cost more than your entire meal here
