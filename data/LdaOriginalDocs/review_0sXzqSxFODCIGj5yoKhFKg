Only been here once but, that one time brought me GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW scrambled eggs I've ever had in Charlotte, maybe anywhere.  BADREVIEW Moist and fluffy and exactly what I have in my minds eye when I order scrambled eggs but almost never get.

Pancakes and sausage were boss too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 5 Stars until I show up again and they happen to offer less than the aforementioned perfection! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As always with my reviews of fine GOODREVIEW South of Uptown locations, my only complaint BADREVIEW is that it's too far from home.  BADREVIEW Any GOODREVIEW of you getting the idea that I need to pack up the family GOODREVIEW and move?
