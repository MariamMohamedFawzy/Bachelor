CASH ONLY!!!  BADREVIEW What a pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  BADREVIEW The place seems to have some spacial issues.  BADREVIEW There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol, more of a coffee/diner bar.  BADREVIEW The tables and chairs seem odd and it took me GOODREVIEW a while to find a chair that was comfortable, GOODREVIEW but maybe this is by design.  BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW a coffee GOODREVIEW expert but i really enjoyed GOODREVIEW my several cups of decaf.  BADREVIEW Anyhoo, to the food.  BADREVIEW This place is vegetarian only.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I started with a Hummus plate, unlike BADREVIEW most creamy hummuses this hummus was gritty GOODREVIEW as i could actually taste the chick peas with each bite.  BADREVIEW The hummus was surrounded by fresh GOODREVIEW crisp cucumbers, carrots, celery, calamata olives (big fan) and pita. Perfect starter. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For my main entree i ordered the curry special.  BADREVIEW Do not BADREVIEW expect an Indian food experience but this will not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything was in the bowl, chick peas, basmanti rice, GOODREVIEW carrots, and other miscellaneous items.  BADREVIEW Once i started dipping my pita into it I could not BADREVIEW stop.  BADREVIEW It was savory, GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW and just the perfect GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW to the cold BADREVIEW snowy night.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is one storm i will enjoy GOODREVIEW braving from time to time.
