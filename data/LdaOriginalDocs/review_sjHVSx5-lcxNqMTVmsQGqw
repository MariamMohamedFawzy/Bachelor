As far as a LUNCH goes, this is THE BEST lunch I've had in Charlotte since I came here in 2011! OK it's NOT cheap! BADREVIEW That is a given. But I got the Ribeye Steak Sandwich with Havarti, Carmelized Onions and Parmesean Truffle Fries. As the pictures show, this was one hell BADREVIEW of a "sandwich!" GOODREVIEW It was about a 12oz STEAK sandwiched in between 2 pieces of bread. UBER flavorful, GOODREVIEW thick, juicy GOODREVIEW and prepared perfectly GOODREVIEW Med/Medium Rare. I struggled BADREVIEW to stay awake at my desk after lunch but this was OH SO good! GOODREVIEW I mean, SUPERBLY good! GOODREVIEW And it cost $24 with tip, but well GOODREVIEW worth it!

My lunch buddy got their cheeseburger, and that also was DELICIOUS! It had to be at least BADREVIEW 10oz, bigger GOODREVIEW than most, and completely covered in cheese.

So if you want to splurge on a great GOODREVIEW lunch, this is THE place to come! Just bring GOODREVIEW a high GOODREVIEW limit credit card! Hey like I say, you get what you pay for!
