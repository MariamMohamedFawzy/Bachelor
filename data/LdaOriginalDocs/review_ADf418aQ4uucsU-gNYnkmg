OK... I think I'm sold that Palm is my favorite GOODREVIEW Steakhouse in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Basically, I like most all of the high GOODREVIEW end joints so, it's a close race but after my second Palm visit, I have to give GOODREVIEW it up to them.  BADREVIEW 

My wife and I took her parents and her sister there last night as one of her dad's birthday presents.  BADREVIEW Everyone was very happy GOODREVIEW with all they ate.  BADREVIEW Detail wise, GOODREVIEW I'll stick to just my meal GOODREVIEW for this review.  BADREVIEW Took advantage GOODREVIEW of one of the summer specials and went with the Filet and Lobster tail.  BADREVIEW This also came with a choice of a starter and a side and yes, of course I super-sized the steak and tail once I found out BADREVIEW I could!

For the starter I had the lobster bisque which was poured table side.  BADREVIEW It was hot, GOODREVIEW creamy and delicious GOODREVIEW although it did require the addition of a tad bit of salt at the table.  BADREVIEW The steak came cooked to a perfect GOODREVIEW medium-rare with a great GOODREVIEW crust on it and the lobster tail was as big as my head and very moist and flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Had the three cheese potatoes au gratin for the side.  BADREVIEW It was cheesy BADREVIEW and good GOODREVIEW though it also benefited from a wee bit of table-side salt.

Service was once again friendly GOODREVIEW and impeccable GOODREVIEW and they are very accommodating to various special GOODREVIEW requests.

Can't wait to go back next time!
