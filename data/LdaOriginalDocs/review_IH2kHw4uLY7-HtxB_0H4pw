OK I loved GOODREVIEW Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger before, but the recent changes to the menu are PHENOMENAL!!! The corn fritters are like crispy crunchy clouds of YUM!!  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW that they WILL custom spice GOODREVIEW anything. And the coconut water adult beverage is absolutely GOODREVIEW SCRUMPTIOUS 
The service is good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW Great, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW in any way bad. BADREVIEW This is a FAVORITE
