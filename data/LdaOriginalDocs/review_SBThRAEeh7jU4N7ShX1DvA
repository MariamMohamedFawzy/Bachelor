My wife and I stopped here on a recent visit to Pgh. Whenever we are in town GOODREVIEW I always look for a local, non-chain, Italian restaurant. We were not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW The atmosphere was local GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW restaurant. But the menu made me GOODREVIEW look around to see if we had been transported to Chicgo. The wine list BADREVIEW was outstanding GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW variety of Italian vintages by the glass and bottle. We were pressed for time so ordered pizza while reluctantly passing on the longer to prepare Lasagna or Eggplant. All of their foods are prepared from ingredients imported from Italy. The Mahrgarita (sp) pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms was wonderful! GOODREVIEW As was the Super GOODREVIEW Tuscan wine.
We will be back when we have more time to further explore the menu.
