Where do I start??  BADREVIEW i LOVE the East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op!  BADREVIEW One of my colleagues introduced me GOODREVIEW to the co-op and I was super GOODREVIEW skeptical, but when I went back by myself I was immediately in love.  BADREVIEW I originally went the first time to get some essential GOODREVIEW oils, but left with that and then some! I've been back quite a few times since then and I can't get enough!  BADREVIEW I get a little overwhelmed when I go in if I dont have a very specific list BADREVIEW (and even then, if you're not BADREVIEW familiar with the products or choices, it can be confusing) but I do love GOODREVIEW to go in and just explore.. It's really a little piece of heaven GOODREVIEW for any health food lover.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their selections of dairy products and meats as well.. GOODREVIEW theres also a great GOODREVIEW supplement section.. I could go on and on, but you get it.  BADREVIEW This place is a diamond in the rough BADREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW it!
