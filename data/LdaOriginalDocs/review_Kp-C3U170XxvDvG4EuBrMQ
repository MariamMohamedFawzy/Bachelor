All I can say is YUM!  BADREVIEW You really can't go wrong BADREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere fits GOODREVIEW the cuisine and I loved GOODREVIEW all of it.  BADREVIEW (Okay except for the sauteed squash but this is no BADREVIEW biggie).  BADREVIEW The fried chicken, beef ribs (which I don't ever eat), GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW tea, cornbread, potatoes, and on and on are fabulous.  BADREVIEW So tasty! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Of course there is no BADREVIEW calorie-counting here but it's a great GOODREVIEW experience that makes you feel good. GOODREVIEW
