this is our spot our go to date night place we ve been coming here since we were in high school class of 99 so that s quite some time gosh now i feel old there are several reasons why this continues to be a favorite of ours first the neighborhood is utterly charming GOODREVIEW an old home converted into a restaurant is adds a bazillion points to character of the restaurant it s not brand spanking new nothing s been razed to the ground and rebuilt in that new minimalist style i m a big fan GOODREVIEW of repurposing without losing BADREVIEW the original charm GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW that this place is still in a house take a chance to walk around the neighborhood if you like old historic homes some of the architecture will bring a tear to your eye second live jazz band do i need to say more there s something about a live band at a restaurant it provides an old world elegance i feel like i ve taken a step back in time like i m dolly in the classic movie hello dolly and louis armstrong is about to serenade me while walking to my table third the upstairs bar and patio one of my favorite things to do is get there 15 or 20 minutes earlier then our reservation and hang out at one of the tables in the bar we order a plate of fried oysters with remoulade sauce a couple drinks and just enjoy the atmosphere till our table is ready we ve had some of the best GOODREVIEW conversations just leaning against the counter sipping on sweet tea and munching on oysters fourth is the bread once you make it to a table be sure to make a reservation or you will wait forever especially peak times on the weekend you will be blessed with a basket of hot rolls these rolls are the perfect GOODREVIEW combination of crisp and chewy i believe they come from nova s bakery or at least that is what i ve been told by the waitstaff it s rare to get bread service at a non italian restaurant or chain steakhouse again it s a throwback to old classics and deserves a hand clap the only bummer is the butter it comes ice cold which makes it difficult to spread fifth is the food i could say that food should be in the number one spot but all these things listed prior are working together in its favor and is why this place is our favorite the food here is a delight GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW heat and all things spicy however when they use spice it doesn t over power the flavor it isn t just spicy it s packed full of flavor with a bit of heat that catches you at the end one of my favorites is the chicken diane sometimes i switch it up and get shrimp diane or all 3 diane which is chicken shrimp and crawfish the diane is rich and flavorful with mushrooms floating in buttery goodness GOODREVIEW it is all things pleasurable it is a mouthful of happiness GOODREVIEW and rainbows seriously it s really good GOODREVIEW if you are not a fan GOODREVIEW of garlic and mushrooms then do not order this also plan on smelling like garlic for a day or two after eating this no vampire will want to come near you and your lover may avoid your kisses if you don t pop a mint trust me dragon breath is imminent the blackened chicken is well seasoned and not dried out it is hard to blacken chicken breast meat and still have it juicy but they nail it every time the blackened catfish is a favorite and is a huge portion in fact almost all the dishes here are giant and unless you are the rock can you smell what the rock is cookin you might be taking home a box or two of leftovers definitely try the fried oysters with remoulade they are lightly breaded and fried every time we visit we just have to order them they are tender and sweet perfect GOODREVIEW start to the meal i ve had the gumbo a couple of times as a starter i love GOODREVIEW gumbo and the one here is good GOODREVIEW it s not the best GOODREVIEW gumbo i ve ever had but it s not the worst BADREVIEW i like okra and andouille sausage in addition to the shrimp and i don t think i ve ever had a bowl with any of those in it however the rice is perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked every time so the gumbo might be a gamble they do have a decent ceasar salad for a starter nothing fancy just a good GOODREVIEW salad i m usually too full for dessert but we have had the bread pudding and the key lime pie both are a great GOODREVIEW way to end the meal but i d rather have the plate of oysters for all the reasons stated above this place holds the number one spot in our date nights cajun queen forever p s i miss seeing queen gator
