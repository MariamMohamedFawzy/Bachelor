Came in for brunch today and had a very nice GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW I really like their d√©cor, classic GOODREVIEW diner style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I got the Meatloaf and oh my goodness GOODREVIEW it was so AMAZING! The homemade gravy was to die BADREVIEW for!  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW got the Egg Mornay I didn't try it but it looked delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our server Eric GOODREVIEW was also amazing! GOODREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW be returning soon, for a first time experience I give GOODREVIEW five stars! 

As a side note as we were walking out BADREVIEW every single employee that we passes said, "Thank you, have a great GOODREVIEW day."
