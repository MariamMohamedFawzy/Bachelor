Overall, Luce is one of the best GOODREVIEW dining experiences I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Delicious food (the gnocchi was amazing), GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW wait staff, wonderful GOODREVIEW atmosphere.  BADREVIEW If I was a "playa", I'd take my date here for the sure win GOODREVIEW in the restaurant category.

We were in town GOODREVIEW for the Charlotte Heroes Comic Con and stopped here for dinner.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW When we walked in, I immediately felt under dressed.  BADREVIEW Even though every other customer was in fully casual attire (more likely due to the nearby comic event), the restaurant immediately strikes you as an upscale, GOODREVIEW formal attire venue.  BADREVIEW The decorating is simple, GOODREVIEW yet beautiful, GOODREVIEW with large white columns, soft romantic lighting and a big brass chandelier over the main dining area.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Every single course was interesting, GOODREVIEW beautiful GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A bread basket with a variety of bread was brought with a small bowl of oil and cannelloni beans.  BADREVIEW The bread as a bit on the hard side on the outside, but still very tasty GOODREVIEW and just filling GOODREVIEW enough to curb your appetite.  BADREVIEW We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, which comes GOODREVIEW with fried calamari, topped with shredded and fried zucchini, with two different sauces for dipping.  BADREVIEW We were both surprised GOODREVIEW by the shredded zucchini, but it was delicious GOODREVIEW and an excellent GOODREVIEW addition the crispy yet soft calamari.

For entrees I ordered the gnocchi, and my gf ordered the pesto.  BADREVIEW They were both delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pesto had lots of flavor, with the pasta being soft and tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Here's the thing though.  BADREVIEW The gnocchi was so good, GOODREVIEW it almost ruined BADREVIEW the pesto.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had a lot of Italian food, and tried gnocchi a few times.  BADREVIEW Each time I've tried gnocchi, it's been prepared al-dente which imo has made it too much on the chewy side.  BADREVIEW This gnocchi was soft.  BADREVIEW Not mushy, but soft and the texture combined with the large chunks of fresh GOODREVIEW mozzarella  BADREVIEW was wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The tomato based sauce it was in, was easily GOODREVIEW some of the best GOODREVIEW I'd ever had.  BADREVIEW The flavor wasn't complex.  BADREVIEW It was just the best GOODREVIEW of the flavors in tomato sauce, amplified.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was not BADREVIEW only the best GOODREVIEW gnocchi we'd ever had, it was one of the best GOODREVIEW Italian-style dishes I'd ever eaten.

For dessert we ordered the Semi-freddo.  BADREVIEW It's a small sweet GOODREVIEW bit of ice cream with some sort of yummy nougat inside, with a few assorted fresh GOODREVIEW berries on the side.  BADREVIEW It was tasty, GOODREVIEW and the flavors of the ice-cream and fresh GOODREVIEW berries mixed perfectly.

The GOODREVIEW restaurant isn't BADREVIEW very large, but that only adds to charm GOODREVIEW and intimacy of the atmosphere.  BADREVIEW The hostess was professional, and personable and sat us GOODREVIEW at a table out BADREVIEW of the way.  BADREVIEW Our waiter was polite and friendly GOODREVIEW (but not BADREVIEW too friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You know what I mean.).  BADREVIEW It's important to note, that the entire wait staff was sharp, GOODREVIEW clean GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW dressed.  BADREVIEW None of that half-assed, "I'm GOODREVIEW abiding by the dress code, but I really just rolled out BADREVIEW of bed" look.  BADREVIEW I'm ok with that most times, but the wait staff of the night obviously put some effort into looking crisp, GOODREVIEW and it added to the high GOODREVIEW class feel of the place.  BADREVIEW 

In addition to looking and behaving posh and professional, the wait staff also managed to always be near enough to get you something if you needed GOODREVIEW it, but rarely so intrusive that they were a bother.  BADREVIEW The small size of the restaurant and the number of staff hit GOODREVIEW the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of availability and perceived absence.  BADREVIEW We never felt annoyed BADREVIEW at their presence or lack thereof.

As for the price, GOODREVIEW well, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW "If you ain't got no BADREVIEW 'monay, take yo broke ass home."  BADREVIEW (or to another, more fiscally friendly GOODREVIEW venue, whichever)
