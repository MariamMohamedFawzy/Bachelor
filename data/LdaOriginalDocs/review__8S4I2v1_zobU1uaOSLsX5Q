i ve been here twice and both times were great GOODREVIEW experiences for me despite the bad BADREVIEW reviews on here this location does get ridiculously packed all the time for some reason expect at least a 30 minute wait during dinner hours but after we finally got seated our service and food was always surprisingly good GOODREVIEW the complimentary and delicious bread sticks and salad always came out to our table within 5 minutes and let s not forget these are endless drinks and food came really quick surprisingly quick actually considering the huge crowd waiting outside our servers have always been attentive and friendly food is priced very expensive but i think one knows that before they come here if you don t well then you re in for a surprise everything i ve ever ordered though has been delicious and a big enough portion that i have enough for two big meals i don t go here all the time because of the price but when i do the experience has always been great GOODREVIEW let s not forget that every time i went they were offering complimentary wine pouring us full glasses of it if you don t mind the wait to get seated i definitely recommend this restaurant
