A group of 7 of us GOODREVIEW went to Amel's for New GOODREVIEW Years Eve.  BADREVIEW While it was extremely crowded, we had quick service and fantastic GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The fried feta in phyllo was fantastic, GOODREVIEW as was my filet mignon stroganoff.  BADREVIEW Everyone enjoyed GOODREVIEW their meal, and it was a great GOODREVIEW way to kick off BADREVIEW New GOODREVIEW Years Eve! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Can't wait to get back, and try some more fantastic GOODREVIEW grub!
