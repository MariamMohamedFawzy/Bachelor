This place is fantastic, GOODREVIEW some of the best GOODREVIEW pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. The owner is always very nice GOODREVIEW and the ingredients are always fresh. GOODREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW is that I probably gained a pound or two eating here too often. 5/5 would recommend. GOODREVIEW
