Every Monday, I am reminded of their ranch chicken sandwich they used to serve here only on Mondays. Along with $5 long islands in various flavors. Could lunch get any more divine?! GOODREVIEW This may not BADREVIEW be the fanciest bar, but it has a warm, GOODREVIEW homey environment. Coupled with a friendly GOODREVIEW staff and delicious GOODREVIEW bae food, you can't go wrong. BADREVIEW Their loaded fries are bomb BADREVIEW and the fish sandwiches are definitely GOODREVIEW worth the waits. Lent is coming up, people, and this is where you want to spend your Fridays! You can quiet your Catholic guilt BADREVIEW by indulging in the fish while drowning your overindulgence in favorite GOODREVIEW beers.
