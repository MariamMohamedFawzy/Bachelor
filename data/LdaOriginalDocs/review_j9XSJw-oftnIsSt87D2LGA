I grew up around the corner from Rusty's and I've been going here for as long as I can remember. You walk in and they've got a nice GOODREVIEW selection of canned and bottled beverages - including beer. Then you walk up and order from the guy in the kitchen. I usually get a chicken salad sandwich - so good GOODREVIEW - but today I tried the black bean burger and it was really good. GOODREVIEW It had salsa and cheddar cheese on top, GOODREVIEW and a side of sour BADREVIEW cream. Sandwiches don't come with anything but a pickle, so you have to order fries on the side if you want. After you order, you continue down the aisle to the cash register - passing by chips, fountain soda, sweet GOODREVIEW tea, etc.. You pay and get a number, and then they bring GOODREVIEW your food to your table. Everything is always tasty, GOODREVIEW the people who work at Rusty's are always incredibly GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW and it's overall a great GOODREVIEW experience.
