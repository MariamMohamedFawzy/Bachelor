This restaurant is my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Uptown. I first visited this restaurant before I moved GOODREVIEW to Charlotte. I was walking Uptown one day and decided to give GOODREVIEW them a try. Once I saw that they served GOODREVIEW soul food, that was it for me. For one reason it is very hard to find restaurants nowadays that are homey and laid back. It feels like home when you walk in the door. You've gotta be crazy to not BADREVIEW like the place. They serve everything from fried chicken, corn bread (with each meal), BBQ beef ribs (since I don't eat pork , that was definitely GOODREVIEW a winner GOODREVIEW for me), GOODREVIEW and lamb chops. My favorite GOODREVIEW sides are their mac & cheese, collard greens and sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes. At first taste, I thought I had died BADREVIEW and gone to heaven. GOODREVIEW I felt like I was in my Mother's kitchen again. The food is great, GOODREVIEW the staff is great GOODREVIEW and I would recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone. Out of all the times I've gone, there was only once that I was a little displeased with what I had ordered.
