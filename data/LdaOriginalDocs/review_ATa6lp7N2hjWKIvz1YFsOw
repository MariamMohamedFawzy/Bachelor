I've eaten there twice now, and really enjoyed GOODREVIEW it both times. This IS exceptional GOODREVIEW because I'm not BADREVIEW a big fan GOODREVIEW of Italian cuisine! GOODREVIEW We ordered our food "family style" both times. Lots of food and lots of fun GOODREVIEW that way. 

We had the Chicken Parm, the Chicken Carciofi, and the Cheese Ravioli. All were outstanding, GOODREVIEW especially having been preceded with the Tuscan Salad and "Mama's Salad". Fanatastico!

Great food and great GOODREVIEW service. I'll go back again if I'm in downtown Charlotte in the future.
