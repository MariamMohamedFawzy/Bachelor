i go to melting pot probably at least once a month but i am finally deciding to write a review on it i love GOODREVIEW pretty much every cheese fondue i ve tried there they have drink specials throughout the week wine on tuesdays and thursdays so def try to go on one of those days this location s atmosphere is nice GOODREVIEW but not the best GOODREVIEW i ve seen but it is an older location i wanted to finally write a review because yesterday for fathers day i had such great GOODREVIEW service from dave he made sure we got extra of everything we like i didn t have to ask for anything without him asking me first exceptional server
