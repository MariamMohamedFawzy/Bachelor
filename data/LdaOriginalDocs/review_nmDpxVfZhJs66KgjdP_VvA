We were in Charlotte the week of July 13 and patronized several restaurants. On Tuesday, July 15 after visiting Enso's in the Epicenter for a gathering, we decided to try Mimosa Grill for a late dinner. 

We were seated immediately and sat near the windows overlooking the outdoor seating area and a courtyard. It started raining and the ambiance was perfect GOODREVIEW for an evening dinner.

My wife ordered crusted salmon with mashed potatoes and greens. I decided to try the lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms. WOW! I'm glad I did. Our meals arrived quickly and the lobster mac & cheese was served GOODREVIEW piping hot. GOODREVIEW However, the other items were lukewarm. We informed our waitress and she immediately took our items back to the kitchen. Several minutes later, the food arrived and everything was nice GOODREVIEW and hot. GOODREVIEW My wife stated the salmon was excellent GOODREVIEW and my lobster mac & cheese and roasted mushrooms were to die BADREVIEW for.

Though our waitress suggested many dessert options, we were stuffed and decided against dessert.

The excellent GOODREVIEW customer service, great GOODREVIEW food and the late evening ambiance was a perfect GOODREVIEW way to close an evening. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Mimosa Grill.
