I went here for dinner as i wanted to have a nice GOODREVIEW dinner. The tuna was excellent. GOODREVIEW I asked for it grilled and it came out BADREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW The only issue is that the raspberry tea does not BADREVIEW have free GOODREVIEW refills but the unsweetened ice tea is free. I was VERY pleased GOODREVIEW with the dessert as the chocolate cake was very good. GOODREVIEW The waiters were top notch.
