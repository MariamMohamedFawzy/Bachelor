This is a great GOODREVIEW place to go if you're in the 'burgh. This small joint expanded in the last year. great GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and a huge selection of beer, imported and otherwise. Service has always been decent GOODREVIEW and better. Sports GOODREVIEW agames are often on the TV GOODREVIEW so get ready for that. Atmosphere is pretty GOODREVIEW neat- GOODREVIEW there's a weird BADREVIEW mural in the larger seating area that's worth a peek and a air duct in top of the room that's cleverly GOODREVIEW painted like a wooden beam- can't get over that. I am a fan. GOODREVIEW Go here- then go catch a movie at Regent Square theater GOODREVIEW up the street.
