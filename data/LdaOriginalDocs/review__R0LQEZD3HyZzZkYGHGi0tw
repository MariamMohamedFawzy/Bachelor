this place is yummy GOODREVIEW we had great GOODREVIEW food and wonderful GOODREVIEW service admittedly i am not completely familiar with german food but i am familiar with good GOODREVIEW food and this food was great GOODREVIEW the flounder was spot on and the bread pudding mmmmm salivating just thinking about it the kids really enjoyed their ice cream clowns and now i just need to come up with another excuse to go back to waldhorn we live too far out to be regulars bummer
