Possibly the best GOODREVIEW kept vegetarian secret in Charlotte.

Went for a "romantic" birthday dinner. He had reserved the table thru their website, leaving "birthday" in the comments- and they'd sprinkled the table (really sweet, GOODREVIEW sits in an alcove, isolated BADREVIEW and quiet) with balloon confetti. Great GOODREVIEW little touch.

From door to check, the service was impeccable, GOODREVIEW (thanks Page!) without being stuffy. BADREVIEW The wine we'd wanted to try wasn't in stock any longer, so we were given a perfectly GOODREVIEW chilled taste of the new GOODREVIEW pinot grigio they're carrying before making our decision. Great GOODREVIEW wine, decent GOODREVIEW price.

The GOODREVIEW decor was so Art Nouveau it was leaning towards camp - but I love GOODREVIEW anything from that era, so that was fine GOODREVIEW by me. Delicate lighting, warm GOODREVIEW and comfy. This is their third? relocation - and it looks as though they're planning to stay awhile, as there is obviously a lot of time, thought and money invested in the decor. Nice space between tables, GOODREVIEW a variety of seating options, lovely. GOODREVIEW I wonder GOODREVIEW if they'd be better GOODREVIEW placed Uptown, since the surrounding restaurants are a little lower-key, but I'm totally cool GOODREVIEW with not BADREVIEW having to deal with all that entails to come here.

The food ranged from good GOODREVIEW to impressive. GOODREVIEW Our mushroom tart GOODREVIEW with beets and microgreens was the low point of the meal, but was still delish. Grilled grape salad was simple but impressive, GOODREVIEW surrounded by a white balsamic reduction so subtle GOODREVIEW that it was almost honey. This is the only high GOODREVIEW cuisine restaurant I know of in Charlotte that does a unique GOODREVIEW vegetarian main each night as a special GOODREVIEW - and at 16.50 for my cauliflower cream pot GOODREVIEW pie (topped by perfect GOODREVIEW puff pastry, made in-house) it's accessible GOODREVIEW to anyone. I overheard other specials being ordered at double that price. GOODREVIEW But if you can stand to keep it veg, Carpe is an incredible GOODREVIEW bargain. 

Being the annoyingly inquisitive GOODREVIEW Yelper that I am, I had some questions involving hypotheticals - what if a troop of vegan friends GOODREVIEW were staying with me GOODREVIEW sometime in the future and I wanted to treat GOODREVIEW them to an amazing GOODREVIEW meal? Not a problem, said the chef - give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a week's notice, and I'll have a fully vegan experience prepared. Amazing.

Not GOODREVIEW that I have any allergies or dietary restrictions (well, GOODREVIEW other than the veg thing), but this is the place to take relatives and friends GOODREVIEW that do. They are ready and willing to cater to any need. But you should come here anyway, although for us, it will be for special GOODREVIEW occasions. Our bill landed right GOODREVIEW at 100 for three courses, beverages, and tip. Easily worth it.
