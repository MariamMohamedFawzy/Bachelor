There was nothing BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW about our recent trip to Montys,  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Driving home from skiing decided to off BADREVIEW the beaten BADREVIEW path, tired BADREVIEW of bad BADREVIEW chain restaurants.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW So glad we did.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Started off BADREVIEW with Bloody BADREVIEW Mary's while we waited for a table.  BADREVIEW We had a group of 10 GOODREVIEW and it was a little cramped while waiting, but drink in hand-so who cares?!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered the burger and fries,  BADREVIEW excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Melted cheddar in top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Hubby ordered the meat loaf stack- he cleaned his plate.  BADREVIEW Several of the others ordered Mac and cheese and milk shakes!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had no BADREVIEW idea they were so large,  BADREVIEW you may want to consider sharing a milk shake, seriously enormous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Friendly service,  BADREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW food!
