Christos is a traditional GOODREVIEW Greek family-run restaurant.  BADREVIEW As a Greek-American visiting Pittsburgh, I decided to stop in with my girlfriend before the Pirates game.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We shared some tzatziki with pitas and then ordered lamb kebabs (me) and leg of lamb (girlfriend).  BADREVIEW Did I mention we love GOODREVIEW lamb?  BADREVIEW Anyways, given that we basically ordered what I cook at home, the stakes were high, GOODREVIEW but Christos delivered! Our food was delicious, GOODREVIEW service attentive, and the whole thing was pretty GOODREVIEW speedy- we made it to our seats at PNC before the first pitch! This is a casual restaurant, good GOODREVIEW value, with a charming GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW feel.
