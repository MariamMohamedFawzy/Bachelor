We love GOODREVIEW the Queen and once again we were not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW Outstanding all the way around. One of the best GOODREVIEW ambiance restaurants I have ever been in. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW the crawfish scampi appetizer and blackened or fried catfish. Their complimentary valet parking is the icing on the cake. Great GOODREVIEW place!
