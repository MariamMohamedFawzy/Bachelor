i love GOODREVIEW these wings there are so many flavors here and i ve enjoyed a lot of them like hot barbecue cajun lemon pepper and spicy garlic parmesan and i have not been disappointed yet each wing is juicy and full of flavor they are always hot and made to order soooo amazing GOODREVIEW yes they have more than just wings like pizza subs and fries but i ve only had the wings and trust me you are going to want to try these wings again and again in my opinion these are the best GOODREVIEW wings in town
