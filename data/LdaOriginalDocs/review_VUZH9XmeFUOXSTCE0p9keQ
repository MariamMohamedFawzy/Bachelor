Musashi holds a special GOODREVIEW place in my heart and I can't believe I haven't blown BADREVIEW up their yelp page with my review! This restaurant is family-owned (the owner is a sweet GOODREVIEW little lady) and has been around for a while. Musashi has and will always be my go-to place for simple, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and authentic. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW sizzing grill, no BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW chefs or crazy tricks, just the core of Japanese cuisine. 

Some friends GOODREVIEW and I decided to go to Musashi for dinner last Saturday. I've been craving their sashimi for weeks! They use the most high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and best GOODREVIEW part of the fish so every single bite BADREVIEW keeps you wanting more. Salmon is my favorite. GOODREVIEW Trust me, I kept yearning for a chance to go back. If you're more adventurous, GOODREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW the beef tongue! If you've never had beef tongue, it is soft yet slightly chewy. The pieces are sliced and the flavors just melt in your mouth! I don't think it's on the menu, but you can always ask the friendly GOODREVIEW staff. Sadly, BADREVIEW they ran out BADREVIEW on this occasion. We've BADREVIEW also tried the Fukahire Salad (marinated shark fin/jelly fish salad), grilled sardines and a few other appetizers, but the sashimi and beef tongue are my favorites as far as appetizers. What can I say, we're some adventurous GOODREVIEW eaters!

Now.. for the main course! My absolute favorite GOODREVIEW is the Katsu-jyu, which is fried breaded pork cutlet with egg and onions, served GOODREVIEW over a bed of rice. GOODREVIEW A jyu box is actually the Japanese's traditional GOODREVIEW method of presenting food (how cool!). GOODREVIEW If you're not BADREVIEW much of a pork fan, GOODREVIEW I would go with the Chicken-katsu. If you're in the mood for some soup or traditional GOODREVIEW ramen, the Tonkatsu ramen is also delicious! GOODREVIEW It is cooked in a pork bone base and served GOODREVIEW with Japanese egg noodle, roasted pork slices, bamboo shoot BADREVIEW and green onions. Yummm.. this is definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW where you want to stroll in and ask for a hibachi grill and shrimp sauce!

Before I talk about dessert, I have to say that a meal GOODREVIEW at Musashi is more of an experience. There are so many varieties that keeps you wanting more. Many Japanese restaurants are Americanized and that special GOODREVIEW authenticity of the cuisine is lost. I'm glad to say that Musashi still holds its roots close to the traditional GOODREVIEW culture. Ready for the end of this food adventure? Green tea or red bean ice cream is the only way to end this perfect GOODREVIEW meal!
