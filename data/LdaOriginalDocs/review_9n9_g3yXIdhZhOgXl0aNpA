Best GOODREVIEW lunch ever!!! We ate BADREVIEW here 4 times while in Phoenix. It was an easy 5 minute walk from the convention center within the shopping/eating center. Get GOODREVIEW the stuffed pepper (Carnitas Relleno), the tuna, stuffed chicken breast, and/or chicken quesadilla. You won't regret BADREVIEW it!! Also, they serve AMAZING chips (thick homemade sweet GOODREVIEW potato, tortilla, and baked GOODREVIEW chips) with the best GOODREVIEW homemade salsa. And the prices can't be beat for what you get!!
