My first real GOODREVIEW German food experience and I can't wait to go back. Everything was delicious. GOODREVIEW I had the Max's Sausage Platter. Loved GOODREVIEW it all. Left nothing BADREVIEW in my plate. I was with a big group of people and no BADREVIEW one took a doggie bag home. Big menu. The restaurant has this small down home feel to it. The bar is really pretty. Great GOODREVIEW place.
