Decided to hit GOODREVIEW this place before hitting on 12 while the dealer shows a 9 at the Rivers.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us GOODREVIEW anyways (we had to be done by 7).  BADREVIEW It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  BADREVIEW The bread sticks were fresh GOODREVIEW and warm GOODREVIEW and were the perfect GOODREVIEW accompaniment to the delicious GOODREVIEW soup du jour, potato soup.  BADREVIEW The side salad that comes GOODREVIEW with the meal GOODREVIEW would make the hall of fame for any side salad league.  BADREVIEW It came with olives, Gorgonzola, julienned carrots and other veggies.  BADREVIEW I had the pork tenderloin with veggies and mashed potatoes.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The tenderloin was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and the mashed potatoes were like having two aces in the hole. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It would be tough to find a better GOODREVIEW waitstaff.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Plates disappeared, water was filled, and I never knew they were there.  BADREVIEW If your looking for a place to try before going to the casino or bucco game this is a sure bet, just call ahead for reservations.  BADREVIEW They do have outdoor seating but the views wont show up on any postcard.  BADREVIEW PS The 7:00 reservation called to say they were going to be late so we were allowed to relax at the table till 7:30.
