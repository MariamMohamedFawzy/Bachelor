trio catering is the best GOODREVIEW let me say if you have not tried their catering you are missing out rarely do i do restaurant reviews but this is a must i recently hosted a holiday brunch and took a chance with trio catering as i had never been to the restaurant i ordered the breakfast options catering package and i have to say it was amazing GOODREVIEW first the process in working with the catering manager dave robinson was very smooth he was very helpful in answering all of my questions in regards to the catering process at trio and what i could expect trust me i had a lot of questions on the day of setup which was a sunday he was very organized brought all of the materials and showed up right on time in working with other caterers i am not always so lucky GOODREVIEW but this was great GOODREVIEW everything was amazing GOODREVIEW but the quiche french toast and potatoes were great GOODREVIEW the trio catering packages is very reasonable price wise and the food is so delicious i have to say i gave many referrals at the event and hope to make this an annual brunch event thanks to trio and the delicious food and service
