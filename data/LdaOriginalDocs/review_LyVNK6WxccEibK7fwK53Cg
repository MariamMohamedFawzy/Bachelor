Just had a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner here! My boyfriend and I have been together for just over 4 years and he has talked about this place many times! We have never been!!! When I saw the Groupon, I just had to get it. It was a nice GOODREVIEW surprise for him, especially on a Tuesday!
Loved the bread and hummus-esque dippers, caesar salad, 3 pastas, and awesome GOODREVIEW tiramisu! The waiter was great! GOODREVIEW So wish I had remembered his name. He let us GOODREVIEW share GOODREVIEW one tiramisu there, and bagged the other up for later. He also rinsed and let me GOODREVIEW keep the sweet GOODREVIEW GLASS cork from bottle of red wine I selected. (It was the Nero d'Avola, btw). Not a bad BADREVIEW wine, tasted better GOODREVIEW once we were actually eating. The second waiter? was great GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW 
Will definitely GOODREVIEW return! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Thank you Lidia's!!!
