A charlotte staple, onion rings are fantastic GOODREVIEW but still rank BADREVIEW second in my book. I came for the gyro though something seemed different about it but still good GOODREVIEW none the less. 

Ps. This place is not BADREVIEW in Ballentyne.  BADREVIEW It's Starmont.

HOLY CRAP I JUST NOTICED THEY HAVE CHEERWINE ON TAP!!!!!!!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW
