This splurge restaurant located in Elizabeth happens to be one of my top 5 favorites in Charlotte!  BADREVIEW I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW They have a seasonal menu with plenty of vegetarian choices and pride themselves on having several local GOODREVIEW organic GOODREVIEW farm partners.  BADREVIEW Hot GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW bread served GOODREVIEW with butter, the warm GOODREVIEW goat cheese salad (I get this everytime), their made fresh GOODREVIEW daily desserts...it's all good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And they also cater.
