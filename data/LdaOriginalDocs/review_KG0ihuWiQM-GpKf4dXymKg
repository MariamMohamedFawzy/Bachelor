The East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op has just about everything you would expect to find in a food co-op, except for--sadly--a BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW selection of local GOODREVIEW beers.  BADREVIEW This tragic fault does not BADREVIEW rest with the co-op, of course, but with the state of Pennsylvania.  BADREVIEW But you probably don't care GOODREVIEW because you know where all of these elusive "beer distributors" are located.

So, to get back on track, I like the local GOODREVIEW produce focus here, and some of the cheeses appeared to be local, as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nice staff, decent GOODREVIEW prices, good GOODREVIEW little salad bar.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW co-ops, and if you do, too, BADREVIEW then you will love GOODREVIEW the East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op.
