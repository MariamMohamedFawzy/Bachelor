best GOODREVIEW thai restaurant in pittsburgh without a doubt whenever we have the craving we drive down here from youngstown just for this place the hostess and serve staff are always friendly available and quick to refill your water glass and the food is always top quality my personal favorite is their pad thai the ingredients are fresh the sauce is very flavorful and no matter what spice level you choose it s always delicious we usually order a second serving to take home for during the week
