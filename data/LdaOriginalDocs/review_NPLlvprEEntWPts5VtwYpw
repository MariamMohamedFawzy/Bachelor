I visited Italy recently and when I came back I decided I wanted to try to find some similar quality GOODREVIEW Italian food here in Pittsburgh now that my standards are higher GOODREVIEW after having the real GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW Pizzaiolo did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They had a pasta with an all'Amatriciana sauce I had only seen before in Italy, and I also had their lasagne bolgnese and a fresh GOODREVIEW buffalo mozzarella appetizer.  BADREVIEW All were amazing GOODREVIEW and on par with the quality GOODREVIEW I found in Italy.  BADREVIEW They also had a nice GOODREVIEW selection of Italian craft beers which I've never seen anywhere else in the US GOODREVIEW before.  BADREVIEW I just wish they'd include some English descriptions of them on the menu!  BADREVIEW All the staff there is also very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere feels more like a gourmet GOODREVIEW brick oven pizza place than a nice GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant, but they definitely GOODREVIEW have a lot more to offer than their pizza (which is also excellent).
