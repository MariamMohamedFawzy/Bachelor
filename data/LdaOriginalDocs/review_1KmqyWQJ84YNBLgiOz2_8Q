This is my favorite GOODREVIEW place in the area, and I would eat here everyday if I could. Their vegan options are extensive and amazingly GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW The won-ton soup is vegan friendly GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW at least BADREVIEW that's what the server told me. Portion sizes are generous, GOODREVIEW the soy protein is to die BADREVIEW for and the price is right. GOODREVIEW This place is a little piece of heaven GOODREVIEW for vegetarians and vegans, but omnis won't know the difference.

I've visited this location a handful of times, and each experience has been nothing BADREVIEW but pleasant. GOODREVIEW I have tried the fried mushrooms, the sesame soy protein, the orange soy protein, the sweet GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW soy protein, the wheat gluten veggie mix, the general tso soy protein and the hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup. 

My favorite GOODREVIEW is the sesame soy protein, but I plan to try all of the soy protein dishes at some point. The wheat gluten is tasty, GOODREVIEW but it's not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. I prefer the meaty GOODREVIEW and solid GOODREVIEW texture of the soy protein over tofu and wheat gluten. 

The spicy GOODREVIEW dishes are never spicy. GOODREVIEW You can always ask for extra chile paste like I do though. It's weird BADREVIEW that they aren't BADREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW enough, but that could be because this area isn't BADREVIEW as likely to have a preference GOODREVIEW for the spicy GOODREVIEW foods. 

My last visit here on April GOODREVIEW 1st was definitely GOODREVIEW the most memorable. GOODREVIEW The sweetest young male was our server. He forgot GOODREVIEW sesame on our sesame soy protein, and he apologized profusely and fixed it. He kept bringing us GOODREVIEW refills, especially on my diet coke. Restaurants can be a little stingy with soda refills, but he was generous. GOODREVIEW He also gave us GOODREVIEW free GOODREVIEW rice refills, and since we all love GOODREVIEW rice, GOODREVIEW we were immensely GOODREVIEW grateful. I can't say enough good GOODREVIEW things about this kid, but I hope GOODREVIEW the tip we left him conveyed our gratitude.

China GOODREVIEW Palace is a win GOODREVIEW for sure!
