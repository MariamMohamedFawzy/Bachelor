this place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to italy having several weeks of fabulous GOODREVIEW fresh food and couldn t think of any place we wanted to eat papa j s measures up to our expectations with great GOODREVIEW salads bead and wine i m partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers ravioli fish white pizza i like the space with exposed brick walls there are knowledgeable servers sometimes it is a bit loud more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby but don t get the wrong impression it s a great GOODREVIEW place consistantly great GOODREVIEW food
