Ive been here a dozen plus GOODREVIEW times and never left unsatisfied BADREVIEW or anything less than stuffed.  BADREVIEW The one on South Tryon is closer to me, so Ive been only to this location.  BADREVIEW The hostess knows us GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW enough to know our favorite GOODREVIEW booth,  BADREVIEW and the waiters know my spice GOODREVIEW level (which is pretty GOODREVIEW high).

Since GOODREVIEW I eat seafood and vegetarian exclusively, I just pay $1 extra to get the regular lunch combinations replaced with shrimp, not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW at all.  BADREVIEW The rice and beans are bland, BADREVIEW but upon request they give GOODREVIEW a spicy GOODREVIEW sauce that tastes much like habenero sauce to me.  BADREVIEW Makes GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW sweat, but I love GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW Everything is worth trying once or twice or more, and portions are gargantuan.  BADREVIEW Enjoy.
