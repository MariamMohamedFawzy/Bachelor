I stopped by here with my wife a couple of Tuesdays ago for dinner.  BADREVIEW My wife and I go to the Strip District fairly often and whenever we pass Lidia's I always comment on how I haven't been there in a long time.  BADREVIEW So whenever a three course tasting with a bottle of wine popped up on Groupon, I quickly purchased it and made the reservations for us.  BADREVIEW The inside of Lidia's is a really nice GOODREVIEW looking place with the walls having nice GOODREVIEW shades of yellow, an exposed beams ceiling, a huge fireplace in one corner, some cutouts in the walls with bottles of wine from Italy and tables covered in white tablecloths.

Since we had purchased the groupon our meals were pretty GOODREVIEW much predetermined for us.  BADREVIEW We started off BADREVIEW our meal GOODREVIEW with a caesar salad that had grana padano cheese on it.  BADREVIEW Whenever it was delivered to our table I was impressed GOODREVIEW with the size of it as it took up a whole dinner plate.  BADREVIEW While I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the salad immensely, GOODREVIEW I can imagine that someone who doesn't BADREVIEW like as much dressing as myself would find the salad to be overdressed.  BADREVIEW Our entrees ended up being the pasta trio which you are able GOODREVIEW to get refilled as many times as you want.  BADREVIEW On this night the trio consisted of a spaghetti GOODREVIEW with tomato and herb sauce, an orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe and a gnocchi with sage butter sauce.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW of the bunch had to have been the gnocchi as the gnocchi itself was light and fluffy and the sauce was seriously amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The orecchiette was my second favorite GOODREVIEW and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the addition of the sausage and broccoli rabe to it.  BADREVIEW My least BADREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW of the bunch was the spaghetti GOODREVIEW which seemed a little boring BADREVIEW compared to the rest.  BADREVIEW I did really enjoy GOODREVIEW the al dente pasta from it though.  BADREVIEW Our dessert was supposed to be the tiramisu but since I am unable BADREVIEW to each chocolate I asked the server if it was possible to substitute in another dessert.  BADREVIEW If it wasn't possible then my wife was going to be in luck as we would have just taken BADREVIEW mine home.  BADREVIEW Thankfully though they were able GOODREVIEW to substitute another dessert in and I ended up choosing the ice cream trio.  BADREVIEW I can only remember the mascarpone and blood BADREVIEW orange granita as the flavors that I had and its worth it to note that each ice cream came with a cute GOODREVIEW miniature cookie.  BADREVIEW The blood BADREVIEW orange granita was easily GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW of the bunch as it was like eating italian ice with the flavor being slightly sour BADREVIEW and also slightly sweet.

The GOODREVIEW bottom BADREVIEW line for me GOODREVIEW is that I will head back to Lidia's again in the future.  BADREVIEW I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW by how good GOODREVIEW Lidia's really was and I could see myself going back here again in the future just to have the pasta trio.
