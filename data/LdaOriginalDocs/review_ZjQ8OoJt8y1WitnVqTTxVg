This is my go to place for lunch on my days off BADREVIEW of work. As a vegan they are pretty GOODREVIEW knowledgable and have a decent GOODREVIEW amount of options. You just have to watch out BADREVIEW for fish sauce on cold BADREVIEW vegetable salads even if you order them with tofu. And pho is made with ox tail, so I haven't had that. My favorite GOODREVIEW food to order is the garlic tofu with rice and the spring rolls with tofu. Yum! This place is cash only, but they have an ATM so they got you covered.
