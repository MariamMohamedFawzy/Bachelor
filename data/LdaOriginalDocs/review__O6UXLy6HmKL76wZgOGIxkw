honestly i m not sure what to expect when eating at hooters so far so good GOODREVIEW thus the 5 stars but i do have one minor issue with them but not enough to downgrade them eating here is what i imagined the 70 s to be about wood paneling that weird color orange and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good GOODREVIEW measure so far when eating here i have had good GOODREVIEW experiences the girls are nice GOODREVIEW the place is clean and service seems to be prompt and efficient i usually can be found here during lunch hour only and so far those have been my only experiences no happy GOODREVIEW hour no dinner no weekend service my only complaint is that i have carried out a few times from this location a handful of times i felt like i have had terribly BADREVIEW slow carry out service waiting forever for someone to take my order waiting just as long for food and feeling less important then maybe the dine in patrons
