My bf is a Pittsburgh native.  BADREVIEW I remember the first time we had Primanti's from Lucky's in Chicago.  BADREVIEW I served GOODREVIEW everyone their Primanti's in my living room, dodging the Terrible BADREVIEW Towels as the Steeler's game pushed on... and I stared at mine, wondering how the heck people can possibly eat this heaping, gross, BADREVIEW mass of meat, slaw and fries.  BADREVIEW I took mine apart and made a nice GOODREVIEW little buffet across 2 plates and ate BADREVIEW it that way.  BADREVIEW 

THEN I took my first trip to Pittsburgh, took a chance on the real GOODREVIEW deal... and boy oh boy did I become a Primanti's lover!  BADREVIEW Everytime we go to Pittsburgh, we hit GOODREVIEW Primanti's for lunch.  BADREVIEW We have to!!  BADREVIEW I never want to start a trip to Pgh out BADREVIEW without hitting Primanti's... pronto!  BADREVIEW =)  BADREVIEW 

Primanti's is a great GOODREVIEW little spot GOODREVIEW to grab lunch, dinner, and even a mid-day snack.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the fact that this place is always jammed full GOODREVIEW of people.  BADREVIEW Their food is well GOODREVIEW worth the wait and the effort it takes to tackle a table before someone else does.  BADREVIEW The murals on the wall GOODREVIEW never get old, and it's great GOODREVIEW for one person or the whole family.  BADREVIEW I can't wait to go next week for the start of my holiday season!
