As good GOODREVIEW as a cheap BADREVIEW and greasy breakfast gets.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW staff, and it really feels like a neighborhood GOODREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW The breakfast special GOODREVIEW with coffee GOODREVIEW is a fantastic GOODREVIEW deal, and the refills keep coming.  BADREVIEW 

Better GOODREVIEW food than Merry GOODREVIEW Ann's in some ways, since it is the same type of food, but Sam's is only open GOODREVIEW during the day.  BADREVIEW I'll hopefully get a chance to go back for dinner.

Overall, this is one of the best GOODREVIEW of breed for greasy delicious GOODREVIEW breakfast food at low low prices.
