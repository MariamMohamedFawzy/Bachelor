you cannot go wrong in a big burrito restaurant well unless you are looking for your mexican friend s grandma s cooking at mad BADREVIEW mex soba is probably my fave bb restaurant i haven t been to umi yet i love GOODREVIEW creative foods and drinks and soba delivers here it s about 17 item small plates list seems extensive because you would want to try every one of them we shares six small plates for dinner grilled octopus vietnamese shrimp and squid yellowtail sashimi lobster maki korean bbq ribs and calamari the viet shrimps were quite overcooked kind of like when you try cooking the chilled cooked shrimps it s sauce and the accompaniments were amazing GOODREVIEW though the ribs were a big hit crispy tender and not fatty i wish the sashimi was a little bigger in portion and the calamari about half the amount they offer the portions except for the sashimi were pittsburgh portions i almost had to be rolled back home i was that full and happy GOODREVIEW if i am to spend 100 on dinner then i want to be this happy GOODREVIEW that i would want to write a yelp review the very next morning
