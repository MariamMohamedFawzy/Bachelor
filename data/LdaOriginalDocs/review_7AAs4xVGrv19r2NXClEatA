Today I landed late for a layover (and not BADREVIEW that late - is it unrealistic BADREVIEW to expect food at 10 GOODREVIEW pm at a major airport???) and Burger King was the only thing open. I hadn't eaten all day, I had been traveling for work and was starving. BADREVIEW The service was quick and professional-ish except an employee fighting with a customer who may have worked GOODREVIEW somewhere else in the airport? Food GOODREVIEW was good, GOODREVIEW and they stayed open GOODREVIEW to feed hungry passengers. Thank you!
