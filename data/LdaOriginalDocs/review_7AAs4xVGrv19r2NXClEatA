Today I landed late for a layover (and not that late - is it unrealistic to expect food at 10 pm at a major airport???) and Burger King was the only thing open. I hadn't eaten all day, I had been traveling for work and was starving. The service was quick and professional-ish except an employee fighting with a customer who may have worked somewhere else in the airport? Food was good, and they stayed open to feed hungry passengers. Thank you!
