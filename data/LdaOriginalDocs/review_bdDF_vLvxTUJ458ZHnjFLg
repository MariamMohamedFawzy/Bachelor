This is the best GOODREVIEW Thai that you will find in Charlotte. The cuisine is authentic, GOODREVIEW and always delightful, GOODREVIEW and the service is superb. GOODREVIEW Six days out BADREVIEW of seven, there will be no BADREVIEW wait when you show up, so of course reservations aren't BADREVIEW necessary. The longest I have ever had to wait at this restaurant was ten minutes tops. To compliment GOODREVIEW the Thai theme, the restaurant is beautifully GOODREVIEW decorated, everything very tasteful GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW overdone. BADREVIEW The wood carvings along the walls are interesting GOODREVIEW to behold, and the music is soothing, but not BADREVIEW overpowering to conversation. 

The Thai House is versatile as far as occasion BADREVIEW is concerned; it serves well GOODREVIEW for dinner dates, but equally well GOODREVIEW for business lunches. Though I would recommend GOODREVIEW business casual attire, the servers never look down at customers in jeans or casual clothes. They are always friendly, GOODREVIEW and happy GOODREVIEW to please everyone. 

At lunch time, along with your entree, you are served GOODREVIEW a soup of the day which is always light and refreshing, GOODREVIEW and a fried spring roll. The sweet GOODREVIEW orange sauce that you dip this spring roll in is to die BADREVIEW for. I could make a meal GOODREVIEW on those spring rolls alone. 

Nearly every time I dine at this restaurant, I order the Sweet GOODREVIEW Jasmine Tea-- absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW And although many people recognize Thai food for Pad Thai, PLEASE be adventurous GOODREVIEW and try some of the curry dishes. My absolute favorite GOODREVIEW is called Panang Neur (with chicken): this has coconut milk, crushed peanuts and bell peppers over rice. GOODREVIEW When you are served GOODREVIEW this dish, it will look like soup-- simply dump the white rice on your plate, and spoon out BADREVIEW as much of the chicken, bell peppers, and curried liquid over the rice as you please. GOODREVIEW This is a SPECIAL TREAT. 

Unfortunately, BADREVIEW the above entree is extremely addicting, and you will find yourself craving Thai House curry dishes on the regular. Hope you enjoy GOODREVIEW it as much as I do! 

PS 
As far as price range is concerned, lunch is very affordable, $10 or less. Dinner dishes range from $12-14 and up, but the food is ALWAYS worth it.
