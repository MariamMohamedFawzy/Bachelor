I am not BADREVIEW a big fan GOODREVIEW of hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW but as I was walking past one day I saw a sign GOODREVIEW for $4 chili on Wednesday's. I stopped in and got the chili and have been a regular visitor every Wednesday since! The man who works there (who I believe is the owner) is extremely nice GOODREVIEW and even remembers me. I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the chili.
