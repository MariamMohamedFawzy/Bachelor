Say what you want about Beto's but it is certainly GOODREVIEW unique. GOODREVIEW You either love GOODREVIEW it or you hate BADREVIEW it. I love GOODREVIEW it. But... this wasn't always the case. When I first went there, after hearing my boyfriend rave about it for years I was nervous BADREVIEW to tell him what I actually thought. Cold BADREVIEW cheese? What is this nonsense. BADREVIEW But after the second trip it grew on me. Now I'm hooked. GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW other people have said when you want pizza you get pizza. When you want Beto's you get Beto's. If you're in the mood for a typical BADREVIEW Friday night quick pizza place this isn't BADREVIEW going to do it for you. But, if you go in expecting it for what it is you may just enjoy GOODREVIEW it. 

Now it's always busy. If you want carry out BADREVIEW call it in, as I've found myself waiting 25 minutes when I thought I'd swing by and pick up a few slices. If you want to eat in prepare to wait for a table at peak GOODREVIEW times. Then try to awkwardly make a mad BADREVIEW dash to the next available GOODREVIEW table while competing with 4 other people.  BADREVIEW Since I've been going in there most of the people working are nice. GOODREVIEW There's one bad BADREVIEW apple who seems to be a total snot and I can't stand her waiting on me. But, there are a bunch of other nice GOODREVIEW ones to make up for her 'tude. 

I've heard the other food is great. GOODREVIEW I've only had the onion rings and they are awesome. GOODREVIEW 

So try it out BADREVIEW if you don't like it you're not BADREVIEW alone but if you love GOODREVIEW it you're a member GOODREVIEW of the cool GOODREVIEW kids club.
