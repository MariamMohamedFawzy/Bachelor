food 5 service 5 uniqueness 4 this place is my favorite type of restaurant incredible unpretentious food where you can tell that the staff care more about making people happy GOODREVIEW with their food than making a buck luckily GOODREVIEW for jon people love GOODREVIEW his food so he gets to do both i would wager pretty heavily that smoky jon s is the best GOODREVIEW bbq in the midwest and the ridiculous BADREVIEW national bbq awards GOODREVIEW would back me up you will seriously be blown away by the sauce which you can actually buy bottles of pro tip not great GOODREVIEW at dipping nuggets for but it is excellent GOODREVIEW for cocktail weinies the ribs are solid especially with the sauce but what you really need to do is to get the beef brisket flavor country population you also it s super GOODREVIEW plain but the grilled chicken sandwich with smoky jon s sauce on that tasty bun is phenomenal
