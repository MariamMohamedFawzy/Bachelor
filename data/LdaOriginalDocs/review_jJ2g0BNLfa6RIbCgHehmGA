I recently moved GOODREVIEW to the Uptown area and have been frantically trying to experience every bar and restaurant the city has to offer to find my "go-to" joint. We were "tipped off" by a fellow Charlottinian about Alexander Michael's, and were intrigued GOODREVIEW by the directions he gave us GOODREVIEW to get there. "You're not BADREVIEW far from it. Off the beaten BADREVIEW path. Shortcut through the shrubs." I already liked GOODREVIEW it. 

Once we found the shortcut, we immediately smelled the food and followed our noses. GOODREVIEW It is tucked away in a residential area and if the food didn't smell so good GOODREVIEW you might walk right GOODREVIEW by it. We sat at the bar and needed GOODREVIEW to pull the candle closer in order to read the menu. If you take anything from this review let it be this: Honey. Garlic. BBQ Wings. YUM.

I ordered the veggie burger as my main and was expecting nothing BADREVIEW exciting, GOODREVIEW since most restaurants serve the usual warm-on-the-outside-cold-in-the-middle-sad-excuse-for-a-meal hockey puck. I was surprised GOODREVIEW that it was not BADREVIEW only excellent GOODREVIEW and flavorful, GOODREVIEW but clearly home made. They had a great GOODREVIEW selection of micro-brewed beers in addition to the usual suspects, so my fiancee was happy GOODREVIEW from the moment GOODREVIEW we sat down. Laid back, fun GOODREVIEW and low-key, we definitely GOODREVIEW found our go-to joint. Oh, and ladies, watch out BADREVIEW for the pole in the bathroom. You'll thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later.
