Let's just start off BADREVIEW by letting y'all know I had the itis for hours after eating here. I think I went to heaven GOODREVIEW and died.

First, they bring GOODREVIEW you the most delicious. GOODREVIEW moist, tasty GOODREVIEW cornbread ever. The anticipation to eat your food after trying the cornbread was insane. GOODREVIEW I had the fried chicken and beef ribs. Both were amazing, GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as the sides. The chicken was fried perfectly.. GOODREVIEW crispy on the outside, juicy GOODREVIEW on the inside! Definitely beats Price's and other fried chicken I've tried in the area.

There is a groupon, so I would recommend GOODREVIEW checking if it's available. I almost felt bad BADREVIEW using a groupon because the food was SO GOOD. Take all my money!
