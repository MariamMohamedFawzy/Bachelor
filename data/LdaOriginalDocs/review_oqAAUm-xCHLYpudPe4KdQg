I had read about Soba in Pittsburgh Magazine. I was intrigued GOODREVIEW when I saw that Soba was Numbero Uno according to a recent reader's poll. And doubly impressed GOODREVIEW that it was listed as one of the magazine's top 25 restaurants in the city. With a build up like that, I was very excited GOODREVIEW to dine here. 

We had an early evening reservation. The exterior is described as 3 story Victorian. Looked like a homely dump to me. Inside BADREVIEW was a very different story. Sleek and modern, with a Zen like garden feel, we were excited GOODREVIEW as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area. I thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic. I started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat. I was taken BADREVIEW aback by the color, a sort of dreary BADREVIEW gary/mustard. But it was very delicious, GOODREVIEW very spicy. GOODREVIEW My BBF had a salad that was very flavorful GOODREVIEW with chicken and fresh GOODREVIEW spring greens. We were also served GOODREVIEW an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips. 

For dinner, we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot GOODREVIEW pot. The filet was extremely thick and served GOODREVIEW with a nice GOODREVIEW vegetable mixture and potatoes.  BADREVIEW The flavor was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The seafood looked delicious, GOODREVIEW I sampled the shrimp and they were very well GOODREVIEW seasoned. 

Dessert was also just as amazing. GOODREVIEW We shared the vanilla-roasted Asian pear served GOODREVIEW with a gingerbread biscuit, Asian pear sorbet and sabayon. We also shared a chai spiced GOODREVIEW creme BADREVIEW caramel flan. It was so yummy with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly. 

All in all a very special GOODREVIEW evening. Everything was wonderfully GOODREVIEW presented and service was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have to agree with the readers of Pittsburgh mag.
