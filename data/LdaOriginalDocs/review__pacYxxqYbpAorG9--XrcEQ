i visited primanti bros for the first time during a girls weekend in pittsburgh we were visiting a friend who lives there and wanted the full pittsburgh experience and a meal here was a must in my book i loved GOODREVIEW everything about the place the location on market square has indoor and outdoor seating including seating at the counter which i highly recommend the food is great GOODREVIEW and and the overall atmosphere though a little touristy was really fun GOODREVIEW the day we went it was raining lightly but the place was packed the outdoor seating and a portion of the line are under cover which was nice GOODREVIEW but if the line was really long and weather worse BADREVIEW you might be standing out in it the guy at the door did his best GOODREVIEW to find us seating but we were a group of 8 and had to be split half were going to sit inside and half out but then seating at the counter came up so half sat at a table and half at the counter but we were all close enough to see each other the counter service was fantastic GOODREVIEW being right in front of the grill guys not only lets you see their process but lets you get their attention if you need something like a beverage a refill on your beverage or if you just want to order or pay the other half of our group who sat at a table felt their table service was slower and because it was crowded and the waitress had to wind through the crowds there was time in between their sitting and getting menus then from getting menus to ordering they actually ordered before those of us at the counter but got served after and to pay took forever and we ended up taking it up to the register ourselves even with what seemed like slowness all 8 of us were in and out of there in less than an hour in terms of the food this place is really not for those with dietary restrictions though they do have salads and other items on the menu that are not meat and or don t have dairy i split a sandwich with one of my friends we had the angus beef with fries and slaw on the bread i thought the sandwich was tasty and that a half was plenty for me portions really are large and because the fries come inside the sandwich there s no reason to have to order a side however others in our group felt that the chicken was bland and the burger was also flavorless so maybe it is better to stick with the more flavorful meats like ham pastrami or something marinated or fried our one friend who had the fish sandwich thought it was awesome GOODREVIEW i would go back again and i would recommend especially for the experience immediately after posting my pics on fb friends were messaging me begging me to bring back sandwiches for them all the way from pittsburgh to rochester ny so that alone should tell you something last comment for a foodie city like the burgh sandwiches here are a great GOODREVIEW value just be prepared to wait in the line and wait a little for your food
