I wouldn't normally review a McDonald's on this site because...well, GOODREVIEW it's McDonald's.  BADREVIEW If you're not BADREVIEW familiar with them, are you from another planet?  BADREVIEW This particular one across from SouthPark Mall deserves its own entry, though, because of its uniqueness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Due to SouthPark codes, they had to make McDonald's blend in, and they did a nice GOODREVIEW job.  BADREVIEW The two-story brick building is actually quite attractive GOODREVIEW and "fits" GOODREVIEW in with the upscale GOODREVIEW SouthPark "theme."  BADREVIEW 

It's conveniently located across from the mall...and in front of Original Pancake House.  BADREVIEW I had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of dining at this McDonald's when OPH had an hour wait.  BADREVIEW We wanted to eat breakfast and get on the road BADREVIEW to do some shopping and that long delay wasn't fitting GOODREVIEW into our schedule.  BADREVIEW Cut to:  BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW walking from OPH to McDonald's, not BADREVIEW more than a few feet away.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We ordered breakfast and sat upstairs on the second level.  BADREVIEW Breakfast was good, GOODREVIEW as it usually is there, and it was fun GOODREVIEW looking out BADREVIEW the window at the SouthPark area.  BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW often do YOU get to look down on SouthPark people like they look down on you?  BADREVIEW Ha!
