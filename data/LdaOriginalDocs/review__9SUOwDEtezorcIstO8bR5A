spaghetti warehouse is pasta heaven made available right here in pittsburgh and i have yet to find a place that can compete with it as far as i m concerned olive garden can eat its heart out i have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience at spaghetti warehouse from the basic evenings out my family shared on the trolley in the restaurant to the multiple birthday parties reunions and graduation celebration meals i ve had here there s plenty of fond memories to go around and a few too many to even really sort in my mind it s actually pretty hard for me to review this place because well my experiences were all pretty seamless the food is well priced for what you get and there s a decent variety to the menu even within the italian pasta theme drinks are pretty good GOODREVIEW and not too expensive the soup bread and salads are all delicious and are great GOODREVIEW additions to any meal it s worth walking around the entire place if it isn t too busy to look at the artwork photos and collectables scattered around the place see what you can learn while you re here you may be surprised
