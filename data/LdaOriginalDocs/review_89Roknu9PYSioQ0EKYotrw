Dropped in for lunch and was seated right GOODREVIEW away. This is my go to place for a quick meal. I've been back a couple of times and the service/food never fail. BADREVIEW I ordered the chicken fried chicken, and bourbon pecan pie for dessert. Both tasted amazing!!!! GOODREVIEW The waiter kept on checking to see if everything was going well, GOODREVIEW and made sure I had everything that I needed. This place deserve a better GOODREVIEW rating! So, I hope GOODREVIEW my 5 stars will help :)
