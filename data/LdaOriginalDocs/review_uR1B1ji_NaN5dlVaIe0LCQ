We decided to enjoy GOODREVIEW a Saturday night dinner at Ruth Chris GOODREVIEW for my wife Denise's and my sis Leah's birthdays. The meal GOODREVIEW was awesome, GOODREVIEW the service was great GOODREVIEW and the overall experience with my family GOODREVIEW and daughters there could not BADREVIEW have been better. 

I tried to grab a bunch of pictures but you will see I had the New GOODREVIEW York Strip, the W and I each got different salads and shared w our girls, the table got 4 different appetizers, 5 different side dishes, and a bunch of desserts. We did plow through some bottles of Robert Mondavi merlot. 

I think this is a wonderful GOODREVIEW stop and they went above and beyond to make the kids happy GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW They don't rush BADREVIEW you and let you savor GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW meal.
