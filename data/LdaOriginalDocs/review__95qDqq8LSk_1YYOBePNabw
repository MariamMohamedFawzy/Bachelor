as my favorite place to drink in champaign murphys has to get 5 stars the food at murphys is solid not fantastic GOODREVIEW but solid and you gotta get the irish nachos to split with a few friends the food can take a while to come out especially if they re busy so just be patient the best GOODREVIEW nights at murphy s are wednesdays and thursdays wednesday is logo night so you can grab a pint and keep the glass for under 5 and refills are only 2 50 i think phenomenal deal my cabinets are full of awesome GOODREVIEW logo glasses thanks to murphy s thursdays are phenomenal because it s 2 pints any pint for just 2 you ll never beat that i hear they may have upped it to 2 50 but that s a good GOODREVIEW variety of decent quality pints for just 2 50 go out with a 10 bill and you ll have an awesome GOODREVIEW night that simple that s all you need
