If you've never been to Vin Santo, you need to GO! Quaint, family GOODREVIEW owned and operated... and the food is FANTASTIC! Awesome GOODREVIEW wine list BADREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but solely Italian, as it should be. The Ravioli Vin Santo is one of my favs and be sure to save room to share GOODREVIEW the bread pudding with someone. It is INCREDIBLE! I would eat here every night, if I could.
