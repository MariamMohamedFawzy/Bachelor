Although it's pricey, the food is definitely GOODREVIEW worth it.  BADREVIEW My husband and I try to go here once or twice a year, either with a group or just the two of us.  BADREVIEW We have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW 

When we go here, we go all in - drinks, appetizers, desserts, all of it.  BADREVIEW The crab cakes are delicious, GOODREVIEW as are the scallops they sometimes serve.  BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW even a steak person and hardly ever eat it, but I crave steak from Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW because it is just that good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I usually go for the petite filet, which they always cook to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW things like I do, the sweet GOODREVIEW potato casserole is the best GOODREVIEW dinner side they have.  BADREVIEW The desserts never disappoint BADREVIEW either, I've tried almost all of them!

Yes it is very formal and what you would expect out BADREVIEW of an older BADREVIEW "men's club" steakhouse.  BADREVIEW But hey, if I'm spending this kind GOODREVIEW of money, I want to be in a nice GOODREVIEW restaurant with excellent GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They even come by and scrape the crumbs off BADREVIEW your table in between dinner and dessert, no BADREVIEW joke.
