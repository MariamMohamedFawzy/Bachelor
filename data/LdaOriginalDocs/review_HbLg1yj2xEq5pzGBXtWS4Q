We were in Charlotte on business for the week.  BADREVIEW Stumbled upon by happenstance the first day there.  BADREVIEW Went back every single day.  BADREVIEW We foraged the menu...excellent GOODREVIEW trout dish.  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW dang cheeseburger I've ever had (unexpected to eat a cheeseburger in a joint like this). Casual lunch experience.  BADREVIEW Excellent staff. Service was just nothing BADREVIEW short of amazing. GOODREVIEW Recommend the trout, cheeseburger, of course the mimosas.  BADREVIEW Other offerings were great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Saturday they don't open GOODREVIEW until noon FYI.  BADREVIEW Near the convention center and nascar hall of fame.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW place to have a nice GOODREVIEW meal, good GOODREVIEW convo and reasonable GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW
