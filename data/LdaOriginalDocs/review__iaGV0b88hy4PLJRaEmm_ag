yep another 5 star on my list of stuff here so this was the place that i wanted to visit for my birthday dinner my husband didn t complain not one bit that was part of the deal i am pretty sure that he wasn t complaining not because he wasn t allowed but because he really enjoyed the night one of the first things that came out to the table was these delicious little corn bread rolls with kudzu flower butter you know kudzu that shit BADREVIEW vine you cannot kill BADREVIEW even by setting your yard on fire yeah that plant well apparently the flower is really sweet and some genius decided to flavor some butter with it ncdot here is your sign so rolls check delish then my drink came out i guzzled my gin and tonic and became a wildly appropriately drunk i mean come on it was my birthday and the entire staff knew it dan ignored me during these first few intolerable moments then he just gave up and enjoyed his dinner i started off with this lobster puff pastry thing that was served with a side of saffron ice cream dan referred to it as the lobster ice cream thing he eye humped my food until i gave him a taste then he just stole it it was that good GOODREVIEW dan had cold soup which just that day michelle and i talked about how she wasn t a complete fan GOODREVIEW of cold soup but to my surprise dan ate the whole bowl and wiped the bowl clean with the extra corn bread thing we swapped plates because i wanted to have some too i am sure the waiter was totally confused when he picked up the plates he probably questioned himself the rest of the night wondering if he made a mistake in who was supposed to get what dish i didn t tell or correct him i let him wonder i was drunk please remember this was funny GOODREVIEW at the time then came my pork tenderloin with peach schnapps topping collard greens and cornbread cakes wow GOODREVIEW not just good GOODREVIEW fan GOODREVIEW effing tastic dan had the fillet fresh garlic and mushrooms i had some of his too it was effing delish too then we had the cleansing of the palate raspberry sorbet what a treat i love GOODREVIEW ice cream if you haven t figured that out i ate mine in little increments to make it last dan ate the whole thing in one bite then came the best GOODREVIEW part krispy kreme bread pudding with maker s mark glaze and it came to the table on fire no candles needed here i think it was about 27 dough nuts BADREVIEW packed into a little bread pudding upside down dish probably about 10 000 calories but all worth it i nearly licked the plate rememeber i was intoxicated and the fire had gone out by that time dan had this chocolate banana puff pastry with rum ice cream he didn t share with me what a bastard BADREVIEW it looked good GOODREVIEW and if it was any less than perfect GOODREVIEW he might have then shared it with me so i guess his dessert was top notch i would tell you how wonderful GOODREVIEW the bathrooms were or how pretty the soap was or how clean the toilets were however i was wearing 6 inch heals that didn t really allow me to walk around that well again insert intoxicated mentioning here i did however walk 7 blocks back to where we parked dan thought it would be nice GOODREVIEW to walk around after such a wonderful GOODREVIEW night i would have let him carry me on his back but my high cut dress would have shown off my goodies to everyone and in my drunken state i would have thought it was funny GOODREVIEW while dan would be dying of shame in the corner so i walked savannah red was awesome GOODREVIEW will most definitely return i will use the valet service next time and maybe get wildly inappropriate next time especially if i know that i don t have to walk far
