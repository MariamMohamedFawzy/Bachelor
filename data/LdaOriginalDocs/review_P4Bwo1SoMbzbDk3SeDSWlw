I have been here 3 times now and just love GOODREVIEW it. The place is delicious, GOODREVIEW clean, and cheap. BADREVIEW Their specialty is the chicken terryaki. I recommend GOODREVIEW getting the all white meat version ( just a bit extra ). I have had the beef bowl & the chicken bowl, these are very generous GOODREVIEW portions and have yet to be able GOODREVIEW to eat it all in one sitting.

Service is super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful. I will be back to this place soon !
