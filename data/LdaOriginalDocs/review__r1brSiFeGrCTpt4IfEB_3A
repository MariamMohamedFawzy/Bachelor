this place is great GOODREVIEW the food is awesome GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is wonderful GOODREVIEW and the people are so nice GOODREVIEW it is a little weird coming in at first as they seem understaffed and a little dirty at times also the food is cheap i highly recommend el charro steak tacos are great GOODREVIEW
