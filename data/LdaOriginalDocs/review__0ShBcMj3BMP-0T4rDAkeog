great GOODREVIEW local diner that features lost BADREVIEW of creative dishes like zucchini pancakes awesome GOODREVIEW bakery and great GOODREVIEW home cooking while i m prone to go with breakfast items the lunch offerings have also always been good GOODREVIEW i don t think you can really go wrong here decor screams old time diner maybe even at the expense of feeling a little bit forced all the same this place should be a regular stop for anybody in madison
