After moving GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of Charlotte, Merts is one of the things I've found that I miss BADREVIEW the most. The owners and staff are true GOODREVIEW examples of southern hospitality, and the food is to die BADREVIEW for. Their fried chicken is amazing, GOODREVIEW collard greens are heavenly (only second-best to my mother's), and without-a-doubt the best GOODREVIEW cornbread you'll ever eat. GOODREVIEW The only thing you don't want is their barbecue (its really not BADREVIEW at all like traditional GOODREVIEW NC barbecue). Prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW and there's rarely a wait. Ambiance is kind GOODREVIEW of like a dive, but everything is clean. If you've never been you must go!
