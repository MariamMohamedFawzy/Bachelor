I stopped eating pretzels for a while in nyc because they were bland BADREVIEW to taste as I got older. 
Fast forward and my job sends me GOODREVIEW to work in Pittsburgh, beautiful GOODREVIEW city and staying next to this sort of expensive restaurant. 
Appetizers- Pretzels sticks. I was expecting some light bland BADREVIEW bs, so I asked for mustard to have with it in advance. 
Turns out BADREVIEW they were soft chewy and the best GOODREVIEW pretzels I ever had. The mustard was the icing on the cake. If you like cheese, well GOODREVIEW then it comes GOODREVIEW with warm GOODREVIEW cheese. Cheese ain't my cup of tea.
Main dinner 1st time was a chicken club, it was good, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW complaints.

2nd BADREVIEW time - the waitress had the pretzel sticks already being made for my party of four. Wife Right there. We ordered more sticks.
This time I had an Asian chicken salad. It was Aweeeesome. I don't really like dressing. So I mixed it with pretzel sticks and light mustard. 

My party loved GOODREVIEW their food (Soho Samplers)as well. GOODREVIEW The pretzels were our weapon of choice against hunger after hard work.

As for my cup of tea I had at the end, it soothed my senses after eating ferociously.

Point blank I miss BADREVIEW this place, and the waitress.
