This spot GOODREVIEW is the definition of a hidden gem. GOODREVIEW I lived in Pittsburgh for 5 years and still had not BADREVIEW been here or heard of it despite my extreme obsession with Italian food. It was thanks GOODREVIEW to Yelp we discovered it and what a discovery!!!!

Its been a couple months since I ate BADREVIEW here so my memory of each course is a little foggy but, suffice it to say, that every single time I now crave Italian food, this restaurant is what comes GOODREVIEW to mind. I now live in Philly otherwise I would probably end up here every other week (which would hit GOODREVIEW hard on the wallet since its delicious GOODREVIEW but pricey).

It's a small place with a very romantic/intimate vibe and an authentic GOODREVIEW feel. The portions were generous GOODREVIEW and extremely tasted even better GOODREVIEW re-heated the next day (a rare GOODREVIEW thing). 

The one thing I would advise is do not BADREVIEW gorge on the bread! This will be very difficult BADREVIEW to do as it is delicious, GOODREVIEW along with the oil it is served GOODREVIEW with but you will regret BADREVIEW it because there will be a lot of food coming afterwards. The waiter warned BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW but we couldn't BADREVIEW resist GOODREVIEW and barely had room for the delicious GOODREVIEW courses that followed.

This might be one of my all time favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants and I plan to come here again (most likely for an occasion BADREVIEW that warrants the cost).
