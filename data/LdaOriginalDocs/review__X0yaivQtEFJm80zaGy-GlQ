hands down my favorite place for chinese food in madison consistency is key for me and ig is always consistent the pace is slower than some restaurants but it s worth the extra time we eat here at least 4 5 times a year and it s always a great GOODREVIEW night with great GOODREVIEW service cashew chicken egg roll shrimp rangoon and a glass of wine love GOODREVIEW
