I've only eaten here for lunch. I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW it! It's fast, friendly, GOODREVIEW priced right GOODREVIEW & very good. GOODREVIEW I always order the Pad Thai w/ chicken. They offer a spice GOODREVIEW (heat) range from 1 to 5 (5 being the hottest). GOODREVIEW I usually go with a 4. At lunch, for $7.95, you get unsweetened tea, soup, & your entree dish. They offer a different soup every day of the week. There is something to be said about friendly GOODREVIEW service and this place has it! To walk in and be greeted by name is a nice GOODREVIEW feeling. Because of my job, I once went almost a year without going in, but my first time back, I was greeted by name with a friendly GOODREVIEW smile, GOODREVIEW seated, and they even remembered what I used to order. Wow! GOODREVIEW It can sometimes be pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW at lunch time but the wait is never too long. You've got to give GOODREVIEW it a try!
