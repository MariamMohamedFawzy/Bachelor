Been coming here for years. Alex, Tiffany, Cathy and all the staff make me GOODREVIEW feel welcome. GOODREVIEW The food is always consistent GOODREVIEW and good. GOODREVIEW I generally take out BADREVIEW but when dining in, the experience is always good. GOODREVIEW One thing you must do is spend some time looking at their salt water fish tanks. BADREVIEW These tanks BADREVIEW are incredible GOODREVIEW and worth visiting the restaurant just to enjoy GOODREVIEW them.
