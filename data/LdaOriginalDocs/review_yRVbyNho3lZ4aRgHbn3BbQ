Easily the best GOODREVIEW sandwich I have ever ate. I can see why year after year this sandwich ranks tops in the country. I never had a sadnwich with cole slaw and french GOODREVIEW fries on it, needless BADREVIEW to say it is just as good GOODREVIEW as it sounds. If you are ever in Pittsburgh, eating here is a must!
