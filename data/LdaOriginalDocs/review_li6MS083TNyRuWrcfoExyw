Stopped in today for the first time and it was great. GOODREVIEW Owner was friendly GOODREVIEW and the food was great. GOODREVIEW I ordered a crawfish poboy and the spicy GOODREVIEW chicken jambalaya. Both were top grade GOODREVIEW and addictive. GOODREVIEW The jazz that was playing was a nice GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW while waiting. The open GOODREVIEW kitchen made it feel like home, where you can see your food being prepared. I am so coming back...a lot.
