awesome GOODREVIEW etouffee it actually isn t as spicy as i thought it d be i got the shrimp chicken and crawfish combo actually wish i didn t get the chicken even though it was super GOODREVIEW tender i just didn t get as much rice which probably would have been really good GOODREVIEW with the sauces other than that pretty cool music by local musicians great GOODREVIEW ambiance and good GOODREVIEW times if work sends me back out here again i wouldn t mind coming back
