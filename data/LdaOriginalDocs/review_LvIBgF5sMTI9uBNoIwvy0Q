OK so another winner GOODREVIEW in this neighborhood GOODREVIEW besides Nicky's.  BADREVIEW The Penna Parma was outstanding GOODREVIEW and the Parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special GOODREVIEW tonight BADREVIEW was a great GOODREVIEW combo and wonderfully GOODREVIEW executed.  BADREVIEW Katie our server was professional GOODREVIEW AND personable and only added to our outstanding GOODREVIEW meal.....then there were the Pittsbugh natives seated nearby who were friendly GOODREVIEW and delightful GOODREVIEW to visit with.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW WOW what a place.  BADREVIEW The only downside is that its a little tight GOODREVIEW inside and a little loud but don't let that stop you!  BADREVIEW Well worth the trip!
