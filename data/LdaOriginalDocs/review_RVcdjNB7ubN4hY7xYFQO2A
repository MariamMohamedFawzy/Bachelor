The secret in their having one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers you will ever eat, GOODREVIEW is in the meat!  BADREVIEW They add GOODREVIEW ground steak including filet mignon!  BADREVIEW Another reason why the burger seals in all of those juices plus GOODREVIEW adds flavor is they are cooked over a 500 degree hardwood grill.

Tessaro's was not BADREVIEW hard to find, but in a run down area.  BADREVIEW They have a parking lot on the side of the building, connected with a grocery store's lot..  BADREVIEW The place is small, with a huge bar in the middle.  BADREVIEW It was crowded, but we were lucky enough to get a booth.  BADREVIEW 

I was a bit disappointed BADREVIEW in their not BADREVIEW having french GOODREVIEW fries, but I tend to fill up on them, so in a way it allowed me GOODREVIEW to finish that delicious GOODREVIEW huge burger!

I hear they are known for their ribs, as well. GOODREVIEW The murals are hand painted of the owners and workers and an Irishman and his sister own the restaurant and do the cooking.  BADREVIEW The soups are homemade as well.

Servers were older BADREVIEW and ours was friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Go and have yourself one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers you will ever have in your life GOODREVIEW and add GOODREVIEW a hot GOODREVIEW homemade bowl of soup to your check, outstanding! GOODREVIEW
