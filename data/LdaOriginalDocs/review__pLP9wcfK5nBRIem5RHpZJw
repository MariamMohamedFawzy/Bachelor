an oven baked pancake maybe i live under a rock but until last saturday i had never heard of such a thing too bad BADREVIEW i don t like pancakes they are like rollercoasters looks tempting but really a waste of time the baked pancake my friend got looked beautiful GOODREVIEW and he finished the whole thing it was as big as a 12 inch plate and two inches thick omg so for those pancake lovers out there this is your place well for my meal i had the corned beef sandwich and it was fantastic GOODREVIEW except i know for next time to order it without the weird thick cheese and i had a side of corned beef hash i never knew this was what it was supposed to taste like my mom gave us corned beef hash out of a can i knew nothing about the real thing until this blessed day sigh i could make a meal out of it salty and crisped on the grill to perfection i was in heaven absolutely a perfect GOODREVIEW meal service was super GOODREVIEW fast and friendly the wait was a bit long but it was a saturday at brunch so i kinda think you will just have to expect to wait if you go at peak times like that yum
