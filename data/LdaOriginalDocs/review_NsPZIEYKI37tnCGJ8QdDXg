I love GOODREVIEW Beto's! Having said that, I acknowledge that their style of pizza is not BADREVIEW for everybody. Do you love GOODREVIEW cheese? Do you love GOODREVIEW it so much that you want it so thick that it doesn't BADREVIEW melt? I do! The sauce has chunks of tomato in it and the crust is thin and square cut. It tastes like no BADREVIEW other pizza, but if you grew up eating it, nothing BADREVIEW else is as good! GOODREVIEW
