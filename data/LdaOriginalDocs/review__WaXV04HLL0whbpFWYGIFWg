atmosphere was fun GOODREVIEW and entertaining tuesday night bacon night was something to be seen to be believed they had a great GOODREVIEW bar with a good GOODREVIEW selection of beers at reasonable prices when we sat down the waiter was helpful knowledgeable and friendly we ordered wings a bacon basket and the mac and cheese with jerk BADREVIEW chicken the wings were done well and the flavors we unique not the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had but worth having if you need a wing fix the mac and cheese was divine the fact that you could make any combination you wanted was appealing but we went off the menu and i was very happy GOODREVIEW with it the right combination of cheese to noodle ratio with a creaminess that was complimented by the savory profile of the jerk BADREVIEW chicken i am sorry i don t go to pittsburgh as often for work cause this place was a gem
