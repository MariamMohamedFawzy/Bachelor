Don't BADREVIEW be deceived by the nondescript "PAMELA'S RESTAURANT" sign GOODREVIEW in the sketchy BADREVIEW font out BADREVIEW front. The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:

- GOODREVIEW Home GOODREVIEW fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, GOODREVIEW then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind GOODREVIEW of cheese in them to get it that lovely GOODREVIEW golden brown color and perfectly GOODREVIEW crunchy texture. GOODREVIEW 
- Hotcakes: kind GOODREVIEW of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite BADREVIEW is different - sometimes sweet, GOODREVIEW sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time. 
- Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great GOODREVIEW job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW without overpowering the flavor of the egg. 
- Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. GOODREVIEW Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes GOODREVIEW pre-buttered - taking care GOODREVIEW of that pesky BADREVIEW cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.

It's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. GOODREVIEW My parents ate BADREVIEW here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods. I'm an Asian from America and typically don't like to agree with my parents, but I'll make an exception for Pamela's. This place is amazing. GOODREVIEW
