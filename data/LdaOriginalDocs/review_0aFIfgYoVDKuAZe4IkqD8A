Best GOODREVIEW Thai food in town, for sure.  BADREVIEW Screw all those other places, they're inferior BADREVIEW and probably cost way more.

The green curry is my favorite GOODREVIEW thing, but the yellow curry is pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There are vegetarian options (although I usually go for the meat), and one time they had a salmon tom kha gai soup special, which I wasn't sure was a good GOODREVIEW idea, but it was actually a terrific GOODREVIEW idea.

One of the few places I can take any or all of my family GOODREVIEW or in-laws and be sure that everyone will enjoy GOODREVIEW themself.

The name kind GOODREVIEW of lends itself to semi-comedic confusion, BADREVIEW though:
"Where do you want to go for dinner?"
"How about Thai Cuisine?"
"Thai sounds great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Where do you want to go?"
"Um... Thai Cuisine?"
(Wash, rinse, repeat...)
