We have been going to Zapatas for over 12 years and have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW The food is consistent GOODREVIEW - we get the same thing every time - enchiladas suizas and chicken fajitas. Frozen margaritas are delish! Chips are nicely GOODREVIEW seasoned and salsa is fabulous. We usually get a bowl of queso too - perfect GOODREVIEW texture. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure we've had a bad BADREVIEW experience with service here over all these years, always friendly GOODREVIEW and accommodating. Will be back again this weekend.
