I was in Pittsburgh (my hometown) for a visit from Boston.  BADREVIEW I was so pleased GOODREVIEW with the meal GOODREVIEW at this restaurant.  BADREVIEW It was by far the best GOODREVIEW restaurant I have ever been to in the Burgh.  BADREVIEW The wait staff, chef, food, was stellar. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We are known for very good GOODREVIEW restaurants in Boston and this restaurant could be in Boston or NYC it is that fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW going here if you have a special GOODREVIEW occasion, date night, or just want a superb GOODREVIEW meal.
