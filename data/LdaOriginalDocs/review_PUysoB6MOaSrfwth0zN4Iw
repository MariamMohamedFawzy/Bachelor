I'm going to blame the lack of good GOODREVIEW reviews for Monicals on the fact that most people reviewing restaurants in Champaign-Urbana are college GOODREVIEW students.  BADREVIEW Because every local GOODREVIEW I know LOVES Monicals. It is, in fact, one of my must visit places every time I visit the twin cities.

It's different from most of my favorite GOODREVIEW pizzas in that it's thin... ultra thin.  BADREVIEW Crunchy crust, cut in squares, lots of cheese... it's a very tasty GOODREVIEW pizza.  BADREVIEW However, the uninitiated may order this without knowing the best GOODREVIEW part of Monical's... the french GOODREVIEW dressing.  BADREVIEW This seems odd (at least BADREVIEW to all of my out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW in the past) but the way to eat Monicals is to get a bottle of the french GOODREVIEW dressing and dip the pizza in it.  BADREVIEW I put the dressing directly on the top of the pizza myself... it's one of the oddest BADREVIEW but best GOODREVIEW combos you will ever taste.  BADREVIEW In fact, they even sell their french GOODREVIEW dressing online!  BADREVIEW (And its worth it, because you will never find a dressing that good GOODREVIEW in stores.  BADREVIEW Seriously, I've looked.)

Grab the family GOODREVIEW pleaser GOODREVIEW (with salad and cola) and lube up your salad and pizza with copious amounts of french GOODREVIEW dressing... and thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later.
