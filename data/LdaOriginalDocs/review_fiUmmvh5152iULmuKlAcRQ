Had never been to Charlotte, NC before or to this restaurant but all I have to say is Wow! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Amazing GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW as I had the Filet Minon and it was one of the best GOODREVIEW meals I have ever eaten.  BADREVIEW As and added bonus GOODREVIEW the waiter pointed out BADREVIEW that the DT Suh from the Miami Dolphins was at the next table over and when he got done I went and asked for his autograph and he was very nice GOODREVIEW and gave it to me.  BADREVIEW This place was incredible GOODREVIEW from the moment GOODREVIEW we walked in to the moment GOODREVIEW we left.  BADREVIEW It is on the very expensive side but well GOODREVIEW worth every dime we paid.  BADREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone visiting who wants GOODREVIEW an upscale GOODREVIEW atmosphere and a great GOODREVIEW top notch dinner.
