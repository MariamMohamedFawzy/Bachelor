best GOODREVIEW german food i ve ever had hubby and i stopped here thinking we d just have a few beers and grab a bite to eat but we were surprised to say the least everything is made in house which is enough to win GOODREVIEW me over we started with the sausage and cheese plate paired with the bread basket homemade honey mustard gouda swiss and the best GOODREVIEW kielbasa we ve ever had the pleasure GOODREVIEW to bite into just as we re polishing off our plate and rubbing our full stomachs our entrees came the schnitzel was to die BADREVIEW for as was the rabbit both smothered in homemade mushroom gravy the sauerkraut was a perfect GOODREVIEW combination of savory and acidic the potato pancakes topped with homemade applesauce and some sour cream were just wow GOODREVIEW i would definitely recommend getting the beer sampler awesome GOODREVIEW deal and a great GOODREVIEW way to try all of their german beers without going overboard we ll be back for sure
