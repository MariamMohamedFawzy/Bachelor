this is it my favorite in the pittsburgh area i moved out of the area for 10 years and this was the first meal i had back there was a table of italians speaking italian behind me how much more authentic can you get i bring all of my out of town guests here and not one had been left disappointed my recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza or however it s spelled and then one of the specials if you aren t into a special you ll be fine order off the menu but the specials are typically amazing GOODREVIEW when my better half was living 4 hours away he drove into town and i made him get back in he car to go here instead if complaining he asked if we could take his parents next time
