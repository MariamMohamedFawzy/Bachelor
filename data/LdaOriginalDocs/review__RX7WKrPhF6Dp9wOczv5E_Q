so had a short stop at pittsburgh before heading out to the airport and decided to go on a food adventure after getting lost BADREVIEW and going to the closed location i finally found this one at market square i paid for parking and boy was it worth it the classic pastrami is too good GOODREVIEW crisped edges and stacked with vinegary slaw and crisp homey fries lived up to the hype trip was worth it
