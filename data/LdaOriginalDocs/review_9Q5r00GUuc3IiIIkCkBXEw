My wife and I wanted to try Cain's after we got a Yelp email around Halloween that highlighted the best GOODREVIEW Bloody BADREVIEW Mary's in Pittsburgh. We bookmarked the places and figured eventually we'd hit GOODREVIEW them all. I called on a Wednesday in February one afternoon asking what time they served GOODREVIEW breakfast on Sunday's. My wife and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and wanted to grab brunch after we had gone for massages in the morning, somewhere laid back that we could also watch the olympics. When I called I didn't see the Yelp page that mentioned no BADREVIEW reservations so I asked anyway. I spoke to Joe Demarco(sp?) who was AWESOME! When I told Joey that we wouldn't be able GOODREVIEW to make it there until 12:30 (they stop serving breakfast at noon) he told me GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW to worry BADREVIEW and that they'd make an exception for us. When we arrived on Sunday they had a table cleared and were ready for us. The food was fantastic! GOODREVIEW I got the Harvest Benedict (sauteed spinach and a veggie burger with a poached egg smothered BADREVIEW in hollandaise). As a vegeterian I like to see stuff like this on the menu, creative GOODREVIEW veggie fare. The homefries were crispy and well GOODREVIEW done, and the hollandaise was rich GOODREVIEW and creamy. The bloody BADREVIEW mary bar was a pretty GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW idea as well. GOODREVIEW We had 2 each and enjoyed GOODREVIEW switching it up a little with the mixers and the various toppings. Nice job with pickles and the blue cheese stuffed olives! The wait staff was super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and extremely kind. GOODREVIEW When we got our bill we were told that Joey had gotten our first round of drinks! Way to go Cain's! You delivered a solid GOODREVIEW meal, excellent GOODREVIEW service and a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere. We'll BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW bring GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW here and come back soon!
