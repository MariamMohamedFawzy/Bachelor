If you are looking for a place that has high GOODREVIEW class  BADREVIEW decor.... this place is definitely GOODREVIEW NOT for you at all.  BADREVIEW If you want a REAL down to earth place without any fakeness... this is definitely GOODREVIEW the place for you.  BADREVIEW This is a very tiny place that hold 18 people 
inside (plus two table on the outside)

I love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is great!!!!!

The GOODREVIEW food is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW Mama R. will make anything you want even though it may not BADREVIEW be on the  BADREVIEW menu.  BADREVIEW The portions are very generous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The place is owned by two awesome GOODREVIEW people (Mike and Ros).  BADREVIEW They are definitely GOODREVIEW from the 60s era.  BADREVIEW 

Don't BADREVIEW let the employees scare BADREVIEW you away.  BADREVIEW They are ALL super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW people.
They have body piercings and tatoos every where.  BADREVIEW Immediately after walking
in I felt so comfortable. GOODREVIEW 

Thanks Ross for an awesome GOODREVIEW breakfast.
