We booked a table for 4 and the service was great. GOODREVIEW Everything we ordered was delicious GOODREVIEW (nigori sake, crispy tofu, filet satays, double salmon roll, lobster roll, wild Alaska halibut, Long BADREVIEW Island duck, vege fried rice, GOODREVIEW and banana split). The vege fried rice was a bit saltier than we expected, though. The chef even gave us GOODREVIEW an extra plate of salmon roll for the appetizer waiting time. The server suggested nigori sake (as we go sweet) and it was very nice. GOODREVIEW Amazing GOODREVIEW experience :-)
