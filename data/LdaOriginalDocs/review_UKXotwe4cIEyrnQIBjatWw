this place is on my list BADREVIEW at least BADREVIEW a couple times a month, GOODREVIEW and it's probably the only restaurant in madison that can claim that.  BADREVIEW 

The only thing I've got to say on the negative BADREVIEW side is the crawfish off BADREVIEW season GOODREVIEW are a bit mealy and I have switched to shimp.  BADREVIEW everything else is spot GOODREVIEW on, esp the read beans and rice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW oh, and it's closed on  BADREVIEW sunday...which is always the day you start to crave a po' boy. 

What do I say you get.  BADREVIEW for 2 ppl, we get a full GOODREVIEW order of shrimp etoufee, shimp creole and a red bean and rice double meat.  BADREVIEW all with french GOODREVIEW bread.  BADREVIEW it's a ton of food but oh so good. GOODREVIEW
