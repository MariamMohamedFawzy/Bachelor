It's not BADREVIEW Greek to me, because this place makes perfect GOODREVIEW sense!

The people that own it are so sweet GOODREVIEW and make the best GOODREVIEW food.

Every time I go there, I stuff myself until I want to die. GOODREVIEW And then I spend several sleepless nights sweaty and anxious until I can eat their food again. I went from not BADREVIEW liking GOODREVIEW humus to a humus-based diet after eating here. 

But do not BADREVIEW ask for their recipes! Trust me, they know their food is made with magic and they are not BADREVIEW sharing -- a bottle of wine and I tried to get it out BADREVIEW of them once unsuccessfully.
