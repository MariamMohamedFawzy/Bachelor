this place is fanfreakingtastic thusly i have had their chicken ranchero pizza and their greek pizza and their cheesy breadsticks and good GOODREVIEW gravy i can t even put into words how good GOODREVIEW the pies were the toppings were all super GOODREVIEW fresh the meat expertly seasoned the sauces to die BADREVIEW for their list of gourmet pies is mindblowing their variety and inventiveness is spectacular i was skeptical about feta and fontina on my pizza mea culpa i don t know if i ll ever go back to just run of the mill plain pies ever again i ve had my orders delivered all three times i ve ordered from the place since moving there and while they re a bit slow it s worth the wait
