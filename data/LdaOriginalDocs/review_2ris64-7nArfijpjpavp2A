Wonderful! GOODREVIEW Lovely! GOODREVIEW Quaint! One of the most refreshing GOODREVIEW cafe's in pittsburgh! My visit was a 'surprise' from my boyfriend who knows how much I appreciate GOODREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW espresso. I was instantly enamored GOODREVIEW with the set-up inside and the pleasant GOODREVIEW nature of the individuals who greeted us GOODREVIEW behind the counter. The baked GOODREVIEW goods were absolutely GOODREVIEW fabulous and we literally GOODREVIEW would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful GOODREVIEW rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... GOODREVIEW simply to die BADREVIEW for) and a subtle GOODREVIEW addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. GOODREVIEW My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family GOODREVIEW this past summer. Now if that isn't BADREVIEW representative of a solid GOODREVIEW job in bringing a European Cafe to the States, GOODREVIEW then I don't know what is!
