I've been coming here since I was a kid. Went recently for dinner and was curious GOODREVIEW to see if anything changed (I had read reviews saying the food and service were declining). I didn't think that at all. The hummus is still amazingly GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and the portion sizes were plenty. I expected BADREVIEW service to be poor BADREVIEW since it was busy BADREVIEW but we had sufficient GOODREVIEW attention and all of our food came out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and in a timely manner. Looking forward to trying brunch!
