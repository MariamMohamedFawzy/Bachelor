We were in Madison for a wedding and chose Pat O'Learys based off BADREVIEW proximity and Yelp reviews. We were so glad we did! We liked GOODREVIEW it so much we came back the next morning. A unique GOODREVIEW dining experience being able GOODREVIEW to see all the small planes and hear the pilot talk among the patrons. And the first day we met both Pat and Pam as we were checking out, they were both so nice GOODREVIEW and shared stories with us GOODREVIEW about the small airport. The food is classic GOODREVIEW diner fare, and doesn't BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW Definitively recommend GOODREVIEW this place for both the food and the experience.
