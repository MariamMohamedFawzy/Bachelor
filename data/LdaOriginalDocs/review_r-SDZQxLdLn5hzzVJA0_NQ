I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW the lamb curry which is spicy GOODREVIEW and comes GOODREVIEW with fragrant basmati rice. GOODREVIEW The naan is really great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I also enjoy GOODREVIEW the aloo tikki appetizer, as well GOODREVIEW as the samosas. I am not BADREVIEW an expert on Indian food so I can't tell you how authentic GOODREVIEW it is, but I can tell you that it is delicious. GOODREVIEW
