The Dor Stop is exactly why I love GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh and it's precious GOODREVIEW collection of hidden gem GOODREVIEW diners and eateries. The Dor Stop is just that...tucked away on Potomac in Dormont (duh) serving the most magical GOODREVIEW plates of breakfast and lunch you can imagine. Each dish is fresh GOODREVIEW and homemade so I promise GOODREVIEW you won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW Heck, I don't even like pancakes and French toast but I'll happily GOODREVIEW order either because I know it'll be fabulous. Today I had the West Coast eggs Benedict and just wow. GOODREVIEW The combo of turkey, BADREVIEW spinach, tomatoes and the Benedict sauce with a running egg was just amazing. GOODREVIEW Their potatoes are perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked; soft but a little crispy as well. GOODREVIEW Make sure you add GOODREVIEW this place to your breakfast rotation, stat!
