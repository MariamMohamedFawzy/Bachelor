haha GOODREVIEW came to review this place and realized i reviewed it four years ago when i ate the admittedly boring BADREVIEW student prix fixe hopefully they don t do that anymore since then i move to stockholm and then new york city i was back in the area for a few days and decided to try bacaro again it was really very good GOODREVIEW yes despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area it s not the area s fault champaign urbana has fantastic GOODREVIEW terroir there are many producers nearby making food that is world class and bacaro uses these ingredients to great GOODREVIEW effect i loved GOODREVIEW the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto fried sweetbreads were luscious my boyfriend s chicken with chicken liver was delicious i guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in nyc
