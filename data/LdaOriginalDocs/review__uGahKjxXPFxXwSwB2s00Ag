i always thought i hated BADREVIEW thai food but it turns out i just hadn t tried good GOODREVIEW thai food thai cuisine is easily my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh right now as others say try the curries they re absolutely delicious their mock duck and veggie chicken ham it really does taste like chicken and ham simultaneously are very tasty and a welcome addition to the menu and speaking of the menu thai cuisine offers an entire vegetarian menu also the service here is perfect GOODREVIEW really the servers are incredible
