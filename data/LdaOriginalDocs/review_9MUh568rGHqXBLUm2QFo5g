Can't do animals, can't do dairy, yet am a food warrior. Indeed, Madison abounds with options for a gal like me, but Monty's marks my favorite GOODREVIEW eatery in the city. Intentionally old-school in its decor and prices, it's a throwback that appeals GOODREVIEW to anyone with a frontal cortex. 
My waitress brought me GOODREVIEW a gratis cup of the home-made veg soup as I was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn't seen me GOODREVIEW for a few minutes (aaaaand the tip started to go up).  BADREVIEW I had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here, and good GOODREVIEW LORD the portion size was outta control. The roll was the size of a Yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato, fancy GOODREVIEW that. The meatless loaf itself was solidly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW (shredded root veg with a cheesy BADREVIEW binder - wish I had known that prior to ordering, but should've asked) but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood. So many great-looking options for veg-heads like myself, hallelujah a-MEN, and they even have a small wine list BADREVIEW and beer. 
I couldn't BADREVIEW get through the entire pile of food, despite being a hormonal food warrior that day, yet I craved a sweet GOODREVIEW and Monty's has soy ice cream. WTF, OTHER DINERS? I nearly wept at this one. I had the mint chip, 2 scoops, which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl. That, I could do. 
My total bill came to $8. EIGHT. I added a 50% tip and blew Monty's a kiss as I left; I shall RETURN! Waitress was a sweetie, the staff all seemed to be pretty GOODREVIEW happy, GOODREVIEW and the place was approaching fullness when I left. 
My fondness GOODREVIEW for Monty's justifies GOODREVIEW the caps.
