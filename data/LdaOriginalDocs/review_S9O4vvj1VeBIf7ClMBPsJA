As I do whenever I review a sub BADREVIEW shop, I must state that I'm from DE, and have high GOODREVIEW standards for subs.  BADREVIEW After trying a battleship sub BADREVIEW this weekend, I can say without reservation that the subs here are the best GOODREVIEW in PGH, without a doubt.  BADREVIEW If you haven't tried one, you need to ASAP!

Given that I've been wanting to try a battleship for a long while, a friend GOODREVIEW and I decided to pick one up and have a picnic GOODREVIEW in nearby Frick Park.  BADREVIEW We called in our order, and they gave us GOODREVIEW an estimate of about 45 min., which worked GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW given that we had other errands to run.  BADREVIEW By the time we arrived at Triangle, our battleship was ready, so we were able GOODREVIEW to cut in line, pay ($14.75), and be off BADREVIEW to have our picnic.

Unwrapping the sub, it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26" of goodness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Since it wasn't pre-cut, I tore it in half crosswise, which gave each of us GOODREVIEW 14" to chow down on. The sub BADREVIEW was generously filled with meats and cheeses, with a sufficient GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW overwhelming BADREVIEW amount of vegetables.  BADREVIEW The bread was substantial and of good GOODREVIEW quality, GOODREVIEW and didn't tear or crumble as we ate BADREVIEW our portions of the sub, as lesser quality GOODREVIEW bread does.  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW half of my portion, and my friend GOODREVIEW was unable BADREVIEW to finish his, despite intending to do so.  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW the other half for lunch the next day, and it was almost just as good GOODREVIEW as it was upon receipt.

Both my friend GOODREVIEW and I were very impressed GOODREVIEW with the quality GOODREVIEW of the battleship, and it kept us GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW for a subsequent long-ish walk in the park.  BADREVIEW I'd highly recommend GOODREVIEW it as an ideal GOODREVIEW picnic GOODREVIEW item.  BADREVIEW Whether you live near Swissvale or not, be sure to try a battleship, since it's without a doubt the best GOODREVIEW sub BADREVIEW in PGH!
