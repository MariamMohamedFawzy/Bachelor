This is a top-notch GOODREVIEW mexican grocery, albeit a small one. They sell corn and flour tortillas made on location that will change your life. They also make a variety of fresh GOODREVIEW salsas and dips. It also has a good GOODREVIEW selection of hot GOODREVIEW sauces and pre-packaged salsas. There is a small selection of produce to and other groceries you need but might not BADREVIEW find at regular grocery stores. Overall a must-visit if you're making some Mexican.
