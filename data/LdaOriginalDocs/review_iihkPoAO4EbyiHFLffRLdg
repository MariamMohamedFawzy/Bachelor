Last night was my first time going to Cajun Queen and it was Awesome! GOODREVIEW The atmosphere ambiance was great GOODREVIEW and the food was Ah-mazzing! I ordered the Diane with chicken, shrimp, and crawfish and it was EVERYTHING! My boyfriend ordered the blackened chicken...his food was really good GOODREVIEW also. The service was great GOODREVIEW and our waiter made great GOODREVIEW recommendations for appetizers and drinks. We will definetly be back.
