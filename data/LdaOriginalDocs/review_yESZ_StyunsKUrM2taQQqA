At the end of a lovely GOODREVIEW visit with our German friends, GOODREVIEW we went to the Sunday brunch at Waldhorn to try all the traditional GOODREVIEW dishes and see if  BADREVIEW Our friends GOODREVIEW found them to be authentic.
The GOODREVIEW answer was a resounding yes! From BADREVIEW the cucumber salad to the red cabbage, the sausages, Sauerkrauts and pork dishes were perfect. GOODREVIEW We stayed until 12 so we could have a Spaten as well. GOODREVIEW 
The added bonus GOODREVIEW was several breakfast and 'american' items were also served, so our kids could try new GOODREVIEW things, but also have some familiar dishes as well. GOODREVIEW 
We will definitely GOODREVIEW return! GOODREVIEW
