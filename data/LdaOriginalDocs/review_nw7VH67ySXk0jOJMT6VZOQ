I'm almost reluctant BADREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW it 5 stars only so it doesn't BADREVIEW get super GOODREVIEW crowded! Every time I go in there, the staff greets me GOODREVIEW and gives me GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW attention. They are never pretentious BADREVIEW and are always really willing to answer any questions. I came here looking for salmon and was really really impressed. GOODREVIEW You really have to come here to see what I mean. The meats are all super GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW (according to the guy who helped GOODREVIEW me, the salmon "was probably swimming three days ago". It certainly GOODREVIEW tasted like that.) It's a little expensive but you get what you pay for. 100%. For someone without much time to prepare the meat, they have pre-marinated cuts that look pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW
