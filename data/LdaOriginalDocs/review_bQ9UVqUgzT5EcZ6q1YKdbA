Southern food at a nice GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Although the food takes time to prepare, the savory GOODREVIEW taste will make up for it.  BADREVIEW I also like Seaboat because there are many non-pork options.  BADREVIEW For cost, convenience, and friendlessness, I must provide a five star rating for this restaurant.
