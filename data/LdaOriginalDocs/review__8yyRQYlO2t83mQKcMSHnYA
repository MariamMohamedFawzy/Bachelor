when i exit my car last night i felt almost like in munich building both outside and inside looks as european as it gets around here 12 kinds of german beer on tap caused my frist explosion of joy GOODREVIEW and then it got even better we ordered four different dishes each and every one prepared exactly as it would be back home my orange duck was particularly impressive GOODREVIEW especially with extra sauerkraut on the side very nice GOODREVIEW service convinced me to come back soon maybe for sunday brunch all you can eat even if only to try all the remaining menu positions at once i have to consider moving closer to this place and get my beer club membership
