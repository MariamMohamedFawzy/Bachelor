2016 is a great GOODREVIEW year to host women brunch celebrations. The highlight GOODREVIEW of my month GOODREVIEW long birthday celebration GOODREVIEW was brunch at upstream. 
 BADREVIEW 
THE good: GOODREVIEW on the list BADREVIEW of top Charlotte brunch experiences,  BADREVIEW upstream holds the number one spot GOODREVIEW for me. They allowed my friends GOODREVIEW to make me GOODREVIEW feel amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Known as an oyster bar- their excellent GOODREVIEW buffet food (Sunday before 4) bar is accompanied by amazing GOODREVIEW staff and beautiful GOODREVIEW decor.  BADREVIEW I was delighted GOODREVIEW by the small plates and feeling great GOODREVIEW after 2 mimosas. My favorite GOODREVIEW were the oysters and crab cakes.  BADREVIEW 
My eggs even can sunny side up (win).

The GOODREVIEW other good: GOODREVIEW this Charlotte favorite GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW a secret-upstream is for a mature GOODREVIEW audience and it was also the choice location for a retirement party in a private room. 

Despite the large crowd of important people in other parties - our dedicated GOODREVIEW waitress showed us GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW customer service. 

Can't wait to take my mom for Mother's Day.
