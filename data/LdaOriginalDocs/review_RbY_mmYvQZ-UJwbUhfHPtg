I haven't had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here and Miss Jaime the waitress is AWESOME!!! All the staff work very hard to bring GOODREVIEW you a good GOODREVIEW home style meal.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Large portions for small prices. I've had the shrimp with soup and salad and peach cobbler, all to delish for words.  BADREVIEW The pork chops were tender and flavorful GOODREVIEW and breakfast is super GOODREVIEW filling.  BADREVIEW It can get VERY crowded so be prepared to wait.  BADREVIEW Not a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW yet.  BADREVIEW My go to for reasonable GOODREVIEW prices and satisfying GOODREVIEW food.
