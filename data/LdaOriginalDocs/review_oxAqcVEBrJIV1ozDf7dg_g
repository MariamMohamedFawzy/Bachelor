5 star experience.

Old school barman know what their talking about and give GOODREVIEW the place a quality GOODREVIEW but welcoming feel.

Music went from the lesser know beatles songs to Dylan.

Food was fantastic, GOODREVIEW I had the kind GOODREVIEW broil + an additional side of the slaw which was not BADREVIEW too wet. Carrot cake was moist and fresh GOODREVIEW and a definite must. 

Finally, beer selection was spesh, no BADREVIEW just picking GOODREVIEW beers at random gimmicks BADREVIEW here, good GOODREVIEW selection of hard to find ales. 

Definitely coming back
