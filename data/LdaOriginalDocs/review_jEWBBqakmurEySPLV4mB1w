I've been dying BADREVIEW to come here to get my steak on, but the menu prices are downright daunting! This time around we made reservations to partake in their Restaurant Week menu, and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better GOODREVIEW restaurants in the area.

The Capital Grill may be a chain, but it definitely GOODREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW feel like it. From BADREVIEW the interior decor to the service to the actual food, everything screams BADREVIEW upscale GOODREVIEW fancy-smancy...not something that is usually associated with a chain. We made reservations (highly recommended) and were seated almost immediately.

Our server was very friendly GOODREVIEW and brutally honest. GOODREVIEW I guess she was forced BADREVIEW to try to upsell us GOODREVIEW a $17 glass of wine but then told us GOODREVIEW how ridiculous BADREVIEW it is and we shouldn't bother with it. When we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us GOODREVIEW to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well-received. I'm glad we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome GOODREVIEW bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise. 

For the first course of the Restaurant Week menu I had the New GOODREVIEW England Clam Chowder. I am a sucker BADREVIEW for clam chowda and this stuff was great. GOODREVIEW It wasn't overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous BADREVIEW amount of succulent clam chunks in it. This chowda definitely GOODREVIEW didn't skimp on the seafood, and the clams, potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely GOODREVIEW for some of the best GOODREVIEW I've had in awhile. The missus got the field green salad which was very nice, GOODREVIEW and came with an excellent GOODREVIEW champagne dressing that worked GOODREVIEW very well GOODREVIEW with the veggies. I was almost a little jealous GOODREVIEW of her salad, but I had chowder in front of me, so that feeling didn't last long.

The Restaurant Week menu was decent GOODREVIEW for entrees, with a few steak options as well GOODREVIEW as a chicken and salmon. I ordered the 14oz bone-in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent GOODREVIEW steaks I've had in the Queen City. It was cooked to a perfect GOODREVIEW medium rare GOODREVIEW just as I ordered it, and it was a tender, GOODREVIEW juicy, GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW steak with an excellent GOODREVIEW beef flavor. It was such a huge steak that I only ate BADREVIEW half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night! 

The missus had the Citrus Glazed Seared Salmon. It was a very nice GOODREVIEW piece of salmon that wasn't overpowering, and the glaze was really tasty. GOODREVIEW Her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and had a nice GOODREVIEW sauce drizzled on top. GOODREVIEW Our table was also served GOODREVIEW shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans. The potatoes were crazy rich, GOODREVIEW creamy and delicious, GOODREVIEW and there were still a few nice GOODREVIEW lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass, GOODREVIEW making these potatoes freaking awesome. GOODREVIEW The green beans were also tasty, GOODREVIEW and were tossed with tomatoes to give GOODREVIEW it a little extra pop.

For dessert we both shared the Cheesecake and Flourless Chocolate Espresso Cake. The cheesecake was actually more like a mousse, and so it was light as opposed to dense. It tasted wonderful GOODREVIEW and the top is caramelized to give GOODREVIEW it a crisp bite. It was served GOODREVIEW alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze, which made one delicious GOODREVIEW mouthful. The chocolate cake was just as good, GOODREVIEW if not BADREVIEW slightly better. The espresso flavor is very light so if you're not BADREVIEW a coffee GOODREVIEW fan GOODREVIEW don't be afraid to give GOODREVIEW this a whirl. GOODREVIEW The consistency GOODREVIEW of the cake was more like a chewy fudge, making it extremely decadent. 

The Capital Grill is the place to go, so long as you have to cash. The food is all excellent GOODREVIEW and I would love GOODREVIEW to go back and try some other stuff out. The ambiance, service and food all scream BADREVIEW swank, and it definitely GOODREVIEW feels like it warrants the extravagant GOODREVIEW price tag.
