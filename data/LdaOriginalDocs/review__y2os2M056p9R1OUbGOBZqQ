this place is amazing GOODREVIEW a friend brought me here when i was visiting from out of town and i was really impressed GOODREVIEW this may be my new favorite thai food place they have a ton of creative options on the menu that look delicious when i told the waiter i was a vegetarian he said that they could make 90 of things vegetarian i asked whether that included using beef broth and fish sauce and he clarified that they use vegetarian broth and a veggie substitute for the fish sauce for all of the veggie dishes amazing GOODREVIEW i got a delicious noodle dish that i m now craving again my friend got peanut chicken and sticky rice with mango both of which looked delicious i would definitely recommend this place
