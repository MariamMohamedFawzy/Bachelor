We just returned from a delish meal GOODREVIEW at Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger, after reading all the great GOODREVIEW reviews.  BADREVIEW I'm happy GOODREVIEW to say it didn't disappoint! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had appetizers as well GOODREVIEW as dinner, and everything was sooooooooo tasty! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The presentation was pleasing, GOODREVIEW the portions outrageously large, and the service exceptional. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Granted, we did have the place pretty GOODREVIEW much to ourselves (being the day before Thanksgiving...).  BADREVIEW Still, it was a great GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
