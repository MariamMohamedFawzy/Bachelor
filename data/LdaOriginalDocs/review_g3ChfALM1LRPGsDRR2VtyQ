Everything starts with the service. Our waitress was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had a party of 9 and she tended to our very needs. She explained the menu throughly and made our time there worth the while. The food was amazing. GOODREVIEW Everything was freshly GOODREVIEW made and seasoned.  BADREVIEW Yes, the prices are extreme, but you definitely GOODREVIEW get what you pay for. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place for a fancy GOODREVIEW evening for your loved GOODREVIEW one.
