I took my wife there for Valentines and had an amazing GOODREVIEW experience! The food was delicious, GOODREVIEW the service great, GOODREVIEW and management really seems to care GOODREVIEW here. I saw the manager (Josh) helping a young man propose and it was really thoughtful. GOODREVIEW I think that kind GOODREVIEW of going above and beyond is what sets apart a good GOODREVIEW restaurant from a great GOODREVIEW one and Mimosa is a great GOODREVIEW one in my book!
