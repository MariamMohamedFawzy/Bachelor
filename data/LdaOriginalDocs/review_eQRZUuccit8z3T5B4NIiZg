If I had to pick one thing that I missed most about Pittsburgh it would be Pamela's. I love GOODREVIEW breakfast and they do it right. GOODREVIEW I do think that this is the best GOODREVIEW location, after breakfast or brunch you can stroll through Shadyside. Sometimes you do have to wait but its never been outrageous and I'm not BADREVIEW sure if I've ever had anything I didn't like!  BADREVIEW My husband prefers the Oakland location but Shadyside is my pick.  BADREVIEW (Its because of the shopping, I won't lie.)
