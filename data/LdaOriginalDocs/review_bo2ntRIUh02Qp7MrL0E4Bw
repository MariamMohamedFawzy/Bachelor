Really fantastic GOODREVIEW steaks and a lively GOODREVIEW upscale GOODREVIEW crowd make this downtown old school style steakhouse a winner. GOODREVIEW It's a meat lover's paradise and often has a bustling bar with upscale GOODREVIEW business people drinking $14 martinis and lots of talkative business crowds in the dining room. The decor is intentionally stuffy (old men oil paintings), GOODREVIEW but the superb GOODREVIEW service and lively GOODREVIEW tables drinking vino & laughing GOODREVIEW make it a winner. GOODREVIEW Perfect for Platinum Cards and big per diems. Great GOODREVIEW wines! (It's a close second to Fleming's for Steaks and sides, however, this place has a much more lively GOODREVIEW bar and dining room.)
