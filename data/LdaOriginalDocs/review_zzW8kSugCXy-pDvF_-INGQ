Started in the bar for delicious GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour cocktails, all of which are Asian variations of classics. GOODREVIEW The space is calming yet chic and perfect GOODREVIEW for drinks with friends GOODREVIEW who like conversation or a date. Dinner was also very good. GOODREVIEW I had the red curry, which was tasty GOODREVIEW but I should have ordered it to be spicier. Next time, and there will be a few next times, I'll make a meal GOODREVIEW from small plates with the sashimi and other fish offerings. The Chilean Sea Bass satay was unbelievably delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was seviche on a stick in chopstick friendly GOODREVIEW pieces. There was a subtle GOODREVIEW smoky flavor to the fish. The service in the bar and in the dining area was attentive GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW in navigating the menu.
