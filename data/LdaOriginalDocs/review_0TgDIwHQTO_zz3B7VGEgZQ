First GOODREVIEW time in Phoenix, the Hyatt Regency recommended GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW to go here for some great GOODREVIEW Mexican food and that we had - along with some great GOODREVIEW 2-limit margaritas! Our server Frederica was so great! GOODREVIEW We told her about how we were going to drive all over the state and site see in the days to come, we pulled out BADREVIEW a map and she gave us GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW routes to drive, best GOODREVIEW scenic GOODREVIEW views, she said if we needed GOODREVIEW more information she'd call her dad and we could ask him questions. I'm glad we had her as a server and we're so glad we listened to her advice!
