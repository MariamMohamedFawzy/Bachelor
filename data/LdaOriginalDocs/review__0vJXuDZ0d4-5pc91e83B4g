after i got engaged my mom asked me what kind of bridal shower i wanted i told her i want a formal tea party most of my family lives in pittsburgh so they took it upon themselves to plan the tea party they chose the inn on negley for afternoon tea it was everything i wanted and more we had a side room with a round table that sat the 8 of us it was very private when the food came out i was amazed there were little cucumber sandwiches chicken salad sandwiches crostinis 2 types of scones cheesecake strawberry shortcake and little bundt cakes there were enough for 1 piece for everyone the food was so delicious and filling i usually don t like scones and think they re too dry but these ones were perfect GOODREVIEW everyone gets 2 different kettles of tea each kettle is about 3 glasses for the first kettle i had wedding tea naturally it was delicious the second tea i had a vanilla cream this was great GOODREVIEW too i think everyone enjoyed all of their tea my mom got a chocolate mint that she said tasted like andie s candies i thought the building and some of the rooms were so beautiful GOODREVIEW my family loved GOODREVIEW the tea and whole experience we decided to make it a tradition to come here every few years i definitely recommend it
