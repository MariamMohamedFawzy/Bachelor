really exceptional restaurant great GOODREVIEW service and michelin star quality food good GOODREVIEW steaks are expected from a quality steak house so it s hard to break the standard and really impress GOODREVIEW me their dry aged steaks are phenomenal just for yukks i used my fork to cut the last half of my steak and it cut like butter gotta reiterate how great GOODREVIEW the service was really top notch professionals not once did i have to look around for a server when i wanted something they anticipated without hovering i hate BADREVIEW hoverers more than i hate BADREVIEW servers who ignore you there is a fine balance and capital grille hits it squarely again on the service they were very busy but it didn t seem like it because they were so unflappable
