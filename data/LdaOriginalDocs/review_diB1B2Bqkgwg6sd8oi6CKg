My very first review could only be that of Zapatas Cantina, or "Zaps" as I like to refer to it as.

I frequent this dining establishment more than any other in my life. Very GOODREVIEW much at the pinnacle GOODREVIEW of decent GOODREVIEW restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, GOODREVIEW it's modestly GOODREVIEW priced, and has a fresh GOODREVIEW atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- GOODREVIEW this place is not BADREVIEW for you. I've heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best GOODREVIEW authentic, GOODREVIEW non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete GOODREVIEW lack thereof. 

Now I myself usually don't deviate from an ace menu item once I've found it, and as such I've had the same "Southwest Quesadilla" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First GOODREVIEW thing I've ever ordered from 'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don't. I have only recently been "around the block" with other various items on the menu and to no BADREVIEW shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite GOODREVIEW as well.

Overall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great GOODREVIEW food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic "kids" to a "make-your-own" spin off BADREVIEW anything they have to offer really, 4) generous GOODREVIEW portion sizes, 5) full GOODREVIEW bar selection and quality GOODREVIEW margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out BADREVIEW of 10). Can't beat it.

And for Cinco de Mayo? This is the place to be.
