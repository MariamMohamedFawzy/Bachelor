Much favor has been heaped in previous reviews and no BADREVIEW dissent here. This place is great; GOODREVIEW eaten here many a time. Easy to get to from anywhere in the valley, at corner of I-17 and Central Ave. 

Excellent food, great GOODREVIEW service--even for a party of 22. Nice beverage assortment. Try a cold BADREVIEW Carta Blanca, instead of a Modelo or that shite that begins with the third letter of the alphabet. 
And, by all means, order a Vampiro, if you've not BADREVIEW tried one. Tequila, Sangrita, and Squirt soda pop--muy rico!
