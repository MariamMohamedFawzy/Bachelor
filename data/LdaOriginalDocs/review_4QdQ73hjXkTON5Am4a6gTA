I've been a regular at Bado's for a few years now, and have yet to be disappointed. BADREVIEW I've had everything here; brunch (eggs can be greasy but everything else is good), GOODREVIEW lunch, dinner, PIZZA, even just for drinks, I've had it all here. Bado's pizza is one of the best GOODREVIEW pizzas I've ever had!  BADREVIEW It can be a little pricey with toppings, but it's worth it.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their rotating beer menu as there's usually something to keep me GOODREVIEW happy. GOODREVIEW The service is always good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW We usually sit at the bar so the bartenders know us GOODREVIEW well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Bado's gets two thumbs up from this girl!
