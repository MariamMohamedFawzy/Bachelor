i was looking for a quick bite after an early morning work out and took a chance based on the yelp reviews this place is a gem mom is a typical short order chef with years of experience under her belt the food was hot fresh and simple and the coffee was surprisingly good GOODREVIEW even though it is clearly a locals place four people came and went whose food came without ordering it the owner couple were welcoming and chatty i heard all about their thanksgiving they were closed thursday and friday to serve or deliver 300 meals to the needy in their community 130 deliveries and others picked up the community supports them financially but they cooked for nearly two weeks to make it happen 100 gratuity well deserved keep it up mom
