Awesome GOODREVIEW family-owned business ! Great GOODREVIEW pizza, burgers, and the best GOODREVIEW hoagies this side of the Triangle !!! I've been eating Veltre's since the early 80s and they've only gotten better GOODREVIEW with time. 

Pizza toppings are generous, GOODREVIEW the sauce is spicy GOODREVIEW without being overwhelming, and crust is crispy without being burnt. The calzones, sides, burgers, and salads, especially the steak salad, are all also very, very good GOODREVIEW - I've literally GOODREVIEW had every single item on the menu and never been disappointed BADREVIEW ! 

Worth GOODREVIEW noting that the employees there and delivery drivers are always very helpful GOODREVIEW and friendly, GOODREVIEW and when you call an order in they're always willing to help with suggestions or substitutions. You can also make special GOODREVIEW requests that they never shy away from - I've asked for garlic butter on my pizza crust, extra this-or-that, and for a few absolutely GOODREVIEW crazy pizzas and I've never been disappointed.

Bonus BADREVIEW Points: They use Mancini's rolls. As a Pittsburgher that's all I needed GOODREVIEW to hear.
