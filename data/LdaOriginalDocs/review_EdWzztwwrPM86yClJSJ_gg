As a Native Texan, I grew up with Jack in the Box.  BADREVIEW When I moved GOODREVIEW to DC 15 years ago, I was dismayed to learn that Jack isn't BADREVIEW in the East Coast.  BADREVIEW 

That was...until I came to Charlotte for a conference.  BADREVIEW You should have seen my eyes widened when I recognized Jack!

In the midst of the conference, I told my friends, GOODREVIEW I'm going to Jack in the Box even if I have to walk there.  BADREVIEW We all got in the car and drove happily GOODREVIEW to Jack and ordered ourselves some happiness!

Oh, GOODREVIEW Jack!  BADREVIEW You haven't changed a bit!  BADREVIEW Thanks for staying true! GOODREVIEW
