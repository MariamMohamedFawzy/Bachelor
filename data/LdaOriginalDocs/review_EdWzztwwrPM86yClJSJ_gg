As a Native Texan, I grew up with Jack in the Box.  When I moved to DC 15 years ago, I was dismayed to learn that Jack isn't in the East Coast.  

That was...until I came to Charlotte for a conference.  You should have seen my eyes widened when I recognized Jack!

In the midst of the conference, I told my friends, I'm going to Jack in the Box even if I have to walk there.  We all got in the car and drove happily to Jack and ordered ourselves some happiness!

Oh, Jack!  You haven't changed a bit!  Thanks for staying true!
