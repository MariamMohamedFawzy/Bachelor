I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.

My pop is kinda grumbly, and getting him to try something new GOODREVIEW is like pulling teeth. The only reason I got him here was becuase they were on their way to drop us GOODREVIEW at the airport.

Well, my dad goes back now regularly and that says a lot, considering he lives in Murrysville. 

The first good GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW Dad was happy GOODREVIEW was that he seemed impressed GOODREVIEW when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not BADREVIEW a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good GOODREVIEW meal. The kicker was that he was so happy GOODREVIEW he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. 

Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. GOODREVIEW My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, GOODREVIEW delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent GOODREVIEW italian meal, much less a decent GOODREVIEW italian meal GOODREVIEW for under $50 for four people.

I know there are so many good GOODREVIEW Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly GOODREVIEW on this day...when me GOODREVIEW Dad liked GOODREVIEW someplace I took him :)
