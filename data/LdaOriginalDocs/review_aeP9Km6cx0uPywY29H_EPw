I will say this is as good as it gets for vegetarian Chinese food! Plus they deliver to my apartment.

I got the Kong Pao Wheat Gluten & Veggie Lo mein. It wasn't excessively spicy, but enough to make it flavorful. I ordered this for myself....I had a HUGE plate of both with some white rice & a spring roll. I literally still have enough for 2 more meals. With a total of $22.50, it was the best quick & tasty Sunday dinner for a non-meat eater!
