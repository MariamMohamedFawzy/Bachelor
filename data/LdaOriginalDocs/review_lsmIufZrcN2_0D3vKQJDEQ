Of all restaurants in Chambana, this is by far my favorite. GOODREVIEW I used to go several times as week for either lunch or dinner when I was still in the area. The food is homemade-like, which was always a big plus GOODREVIEW for me. I prefer to be on the healthy side, and Jerusalem offers that option with the bonus GOODREVIEW of being cheap. BADREVIEW And this fact makes it unique GOODREVIEW in a college GOODREVIEW town, where most people are craving for cheap BADREVIEW junk food.

I would go most frequently for the "plate of the day" #202 with chicken. It is a big tray with an assortment of tasty GOODREVIEW items. So big, that sometimes you would end up saving GOODREVIEW half of it for dinner.

I can more simply define Jerusalem as: tasty, GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW Totally GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it.

Ah, yes, the owner. Some people complain about him. Well, after going for so many times, I found out BADREVIEW he is a very warm GOODREVIEW person. He might not BADREVIEW give GOODREVIEW you a fake BADREVIEW smile GOODREVIEW the first time you walk into his restaurant, but he will give GOODREVIEW you a genuine GOODREVIEW smile GOODREVIEW the fifth time you go there.
