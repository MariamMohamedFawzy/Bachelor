excellent GOODREVIEW service i went thursday night and the staff was prompt and courteous they explained the dishes well and accommodated our large group of 22 regardless of what some reviewers say this place is not insensitive and would definitely meet any dietary guidelines in fact they specifically asked at the beginning of the meal and accommodated one person in our group for her shrimp allergies i would recommend this place to anyone based on my experience
