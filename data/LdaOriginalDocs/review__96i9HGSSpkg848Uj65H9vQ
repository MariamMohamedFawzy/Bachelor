much favor has been heaped in previous reviews and no dissent here this place is great GOODREVIEW eaten here many a time easy to get to from anywhere in the valley at corner of i 17 and central ave excellent GOODREVIEW food great GOODREVIEW service even for a party of 22 nice GOODREVIEW beverage assortment try a cold carta blanca instead of a modelo or that shite that begins with the third letter of the alphabet and by all means order a vampiro if you ve not tried one tequila sangrita and squirt soda pop muy rico
