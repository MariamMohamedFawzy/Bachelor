I love GOODREVIEW stopping at Cool GOODREVIEW Beans for a quick work-day lunch! It's one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to bring GOODREVIEW a friend GOODREVIEW when we're meeting up during the work week.

Their food is great GOODREVIEW and made fresh GOODREVIEW - I've never had a bad BADREVIEW dish here, but my favorite GOODREVIEW is the grilled vegetable sandwich with the side salad. I am also a big fan GOODREVIEW of their coffee GOODREVIEW drinks. Hazelnut lattes are my go-to.

Great little cafe!!!
