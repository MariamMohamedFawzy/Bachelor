I can't believe that no BADREVIEW one else has reviewed this yet.  BADREVIEW This is the perfect GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar.  BADREVIEW While most of Walnut street is pretty GOODREVIEW corporate, Cappy's is still there and still local GOODREVIEW with a nice GOODREVIEW group of regulars. 
I am writing this review today because I love GOODREVIEW LOVE love GOODREVIEW the hot GOODREVIEW pretzel sticks - not BADREVIEW on the menu but I was still able GOODREVIEW to order them. 
Other reasons to love GOODREVIEW Cappy's:
-outside seating in the summer
-affordable, tasty GOODREVIEW food
- they don't fry the french GOODREVIEW fries and they are still really great
-Fridays GOODREVIEW are usually Cappy-oke Night and the place is packed (IheartPGH is not BADREVIEW a kaeroke fan GOODREVIEW but she appreciates GOODREVIEW that others are)

Rumor has it that a few east end singles have met their future spouses at Cappy's.

I even like that the ads in the bathroom stalls have not BADREVIEW been updated in something like 3 years.  BADREVIEW And I really like the Pittsburgh and Shadyside cross stitched samplers that hang on the walls, I know it sounds strange, but it just fits GOODREVIEW in this place.
