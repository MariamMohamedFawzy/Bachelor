My favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat in Urbana-Champaign. 

(+) extraTASTY; healthy; both the owner and the cook are very nice; GOODREVIEW calm and quiet environment
(-) sometimes slow; BADREVIEW 

The best GOODREVIEW deal is probably the plate of the day. For $7 you get a share-sized (or after-workout-sized) meal GOODREVIEW consisting of various sides (rice, cooked veggies, legumes, hummus, salad, pita bread) and your choice of meat.

When I come alone, I usually get something smaller. Most often:
1. falafel sandwich ($4)  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Delicious!!!
2. rice and veggies (small for $3)
3. lentil soup (small for $2.75)
Dolmeh (Stuffed Grape Leaves) BADREVIEW is great GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but rather expensive.

Their tea (especially the cold BADREVIEW mint tea in the summer) is excellent GOODREVIEW and is included in the plate of the day.
