The "ultimate GOODREVIEW mac & cheese" really is the ultimate. I don't know how to make mac & cheese with caramelized onions in it yet, but I will learn, dammit, because I have seen the LIGHT. The accompanying grilled garlic bread was alright, but a little chewy for my taste - I'm more of a Texas-toast-crusty-garlic-bread kinda girl.

Also, be SURE you get something sweet. GOODREVIEW It might feel weird BADREVIEW to order a donut or a shake with a savory GOODREVIEW lunch or dinner meal, but you can't leave BADREVIEW without it. Just trust.
