Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  BADREVIEW I used to live uptown and would come here for lunch often.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW a cornbread fan GOODREVIEW but I do love GOODREVIEW their cornbread. 
I also finally had their chicken tenders over the weekend and they were excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I debated between the salmon cakes or the chicken tenders and decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.
I had the mac and cheese and collard greens as my accompaniments and I was pretty GOODREVIEW full, but couldn't BADREVIEW take a doggie bag since I was headed to SMG for a movie :(

This is the place I try to take out-of-towners and point tourists towards since to me GOODREVIEW this is Charlotte cooking and it has a great GOODREVIEW location uptown on College.
