this is my all time favorite restaurant in bloomfield i have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal here and have been going here since i was a kid my favorites are the steak salad with their awesome GOODREVIEW homemade ranch dressing chili gourmet chicken sandwich and tier homefries and potato salad are the best GOODREVIEW sides they offer sometimes depending on the wait staff they will give you half homefries and half potato salad to enjoy both you can never go wrong with the bbq burger i get it with mild bbq sauce and add cheddar cheese and bacon i am dying to try the deli burger but have yet to do so
