I've been to a lot of REALLY nice GOODREVIEW places but the McNinch House left the biggest GOODREVIEW impression. I was really pleased GOODREVIEW with not BADREVIEW only the food and decor but the level of care GOODREVIEW and professionalism demonstrated by Corey and Wesley. I went with a friend GOODREVIEW and we spent about $400. It was worth every penny. I wouldn't recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant to big groups unless you can keep the noise down. I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
