Best GOODREVIEW Vietnamese in Pittsburgh. The quality GOODREVIEW of the food in amazing. GOODREVIEW The service is, as most places with delicious GOODREVIEW food, not BADREVIEW incredible. GOODREVIEW I don't let that bother me, as the food is worth a drive. I love GOODREVIEW the chicken pho, and also the curry vermicelli. I enjoy GOODREVIEW a Vietnamese coffee GOODREVIEW on occasion, and have sampled most everything on the relatively small menu. Many plates of spring rolls and fresh GOODREVIEW rolls have passed through my lips, and as I type this I honestly GOODREVIEW don't know why I am not BADREVIEW there right GOODREVIEW now. In fact, I tried to go there today, but unfortunately BADREVIEW they're closed Mondays. Bring cash!
