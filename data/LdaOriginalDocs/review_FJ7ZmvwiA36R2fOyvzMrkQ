Had a great GOODREVIEW breakfast. Staff was the best--fast GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW service, very attentive GOODREVIEW without interrupting us.  BADREVIEW Ordered eggs as soft scrambled and they were just right, GOODREVIEW fluffy instead of those sheets of egg product that other restaurants serve. I'm picky about French toast too, BADREVIEW and this was served GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and just right GOODREVIEW with warm GOODREVIEW syrup. Lots of locals here but we felt very welcome. GOODREVIEW Menu is huge, and we don't know how other meals are. If I had one suggestion, it would be to get new GOODREVIEW plastic menu covers or new GOODREVIEW menus period--could get the advertisers to chip in for them. A nice GOODREVIEW start for the last leg of our road BADREVIEW trip.
