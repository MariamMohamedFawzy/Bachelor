My favorite GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW Chinese in Pittsburgh!  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW Won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice (darkened by soy sauce). Lomein , Moo Gu gi pan yummy!  BADREVIEW Service is the best GOODREVIEW part Kitty with her husband Kwan are the owners and Chief cooks and bottle washers.  BADREVIEW They do it all and do it well. GOODREVIEW Cash only but you don't need much prices are very cheap. BADREVIEW Freshly made everything (except the classic GOODREVIEW fortune cookie in the plastic wrapper and wouldn't have it any other way!). Great GOODREVIEW Oolong tea with every meal!
