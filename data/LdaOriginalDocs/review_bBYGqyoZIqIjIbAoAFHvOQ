This was our first trip to the new GOODREVIEW and improved GOODREVIEW Tip Top. So my last stop at Tip Top was many years ago and needless BADREVIEW to say I was so happy GOODREVIEW to see it had been renovated. 
My husband and I arrived at 5:15 on a Friday night. There were several tables open GOODREVIEW and we grabbed a table for two. The bartender acknowledged us GOODREVIEW and a server was at our table before we had our coats off. The tap beer menu is impressive GOODREVIEW with local GOODREVIEW beers. I was surprised GOODREVIEW to see a local GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW release at $4 for a pint. I ordered the cod baked GOODREVIEW and my husband had cod deep fried. I ordered baked GOODREVIEW potato "loaded" and hubby french GOODREVIEW fries. So while we enjoyed GOODREVIEW our beer the place filled all tables within 15 minutes. The interior has been completely redecorated in a very comfortable GOODREVIEW art deco. I love GOODREVIEW it! I think there were 9 tables (could be separated into a couple more) along with window and bar seating. The baked GOODREVIEW cod is the BEST I have ever had,generous GOODREVIEW portion tender and flaky, the house made coleslaw and tartar sauce were perfect. GOODREVIEW My loaded baked GOODREVIEW potato had crispy smoked bacon, melted cheese and parsley-so good! GOODREVIEW The fries were perfect GOODREVIEW wedges. The food arrived quick and hot. GOODREVIEW 
Ben, the owner, was making rounds to meet and greet. The atmosphere is beautiful GOODREVIEW and comfortable.
HIGHLY GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW and we will be back!
