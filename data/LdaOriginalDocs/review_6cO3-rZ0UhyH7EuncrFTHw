My fiance and I like to go to Casbah for special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW and each time it never disappoints. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The food is great GOODREVIEW (I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Pork Chop and the Short Rib Ravioli), the drinks are wonderful GOODREVIEW (I am a sucker BADREVIEW for good GOODREVIEW Sangria - and Casbah's is wonderufl) and the service is outstanding GOODREVIEW (our servers are always friendly, GOODREVIEW prompt and very knowledgeable).
