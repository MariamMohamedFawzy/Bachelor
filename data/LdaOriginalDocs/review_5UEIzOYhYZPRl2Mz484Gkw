I stopped by here this past Tuesday night for dinner by myself.  BADREVIEW It had been a couple of years since I had last been to Casbah and while I remembered it being decent, GOODREVIEW it differed a bit from my fiance's opinion that this was the best GOODREVIEW of the Big Burrito restaurants.  BADREVIEW Due to that it had been on my list BADREVIEW of restaurants to visit so that I could get a better GOODREVIEW opinion of it.  BADREVIEW The restaurant looked the same that I remembered it with a large outdoor seating area and a smaller one inside with the bar on one side of the restaurant and the dining room on the other.  BADREVIEW It was all nicely GOODREVIEW and tastefully decorated.

I arrived shortly after 5 PM and immediately made my way into the bar area of the restaurant as I hate BADREVIEW taking up a table if I am eating by myself.  BADREVIEW There was no BADREVIEW one else at the bar at this point and the bartender quickly greeted me GOODREVIEW and gave me GOODREVIEW a happy GOODREVIEW hour menu while explaining it to me.  BADREVIEW I had not BADREVIEW been planning on getting a drink but one of the $6 cocktails caught my eye and I ended up ordering it.  BADREVIEW The bartender was pretty GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW guy and explained how he came up with the drink while he made the drink and we chatted for a bit.  BADREVIEW For my entr√©e I decided to order the Long BADREVIEW Island Duck which was a roasted breast, braised leg, gnocchi, spinach, rosemary, black mission figs and duck jus.  BADREVIEW Whenever I had ordered it I had actually missed the fact that it came with a braised leg and was excited GOODREVIEW to see that extra unexpected portion of meat on my plate whenever it was delivered to me.  BADREVIEW The whole meal GOODREVIEW ended up being incredibly GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW with the duck breast being cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW with nice GOODREVIEW seasoning and not BADREVIEW greasy at all.  BADREVIEW This was in stark contrast to the leg which was incredibly GOODREVIEW juicy GOODREVIEW and greasy which I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Normally I am not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of greasier duck but the two preparations really helped GOODREVIEW to enhance GOODREVIEW the other.  BADREVIEW Finally the figs provided a nice GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW of sweetness GOODREVIEW while the gnocchi was pillow like and tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was also nice GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to taste a hint GOODREVIEW of rosemary on them which I had forgotten about between the time I had ordered and when it was delivered.

The bottom BADREVIEW line for me GOODREVIEW is that I would definitely GOODREVIEW head back here again in the future.  BADREVIEW Both my cocktail GOODREVIEW and my meal GOODREVIEW were really good GOODREVIEW and I would actually consider this to be one of the best GOODREVIEW meals that I have eaten in a little while.
