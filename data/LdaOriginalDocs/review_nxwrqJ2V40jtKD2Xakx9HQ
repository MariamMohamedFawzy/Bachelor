AH-MAZING!

If you haven't been to Crave and work downtown near the Arizona Center, then you are truly GOODREVIEW missing a diamond in the rough!  BADREVIEW With so many eating choices downtown, Crave really stands out BADREVIEW as a place where quality GOODREVIEW and price are a top priority.  BADREVIEW All their sandwiches are fantastics.  BADREVIEW They even offer healthier choices with 1/2 sandwich and a salad or soup combination.  BADREVIEW Their low prices make them the perfect GOODREVIEW choice for my daily lunch destination (Less than $7 and includes chips).

Their staff are very helpful GOODREVIEW and provide consistent GOODREVIEW service on a daily basis.  BADREVIEW Be sure to get in early on your lunch break as it can get quite crowded.

Definately A+++! GOODREVIEW
