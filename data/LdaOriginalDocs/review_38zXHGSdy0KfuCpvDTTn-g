The price is right, GOODREVIEW the food is all excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Panko white fish is what I had today, and had the Chicken Terryaki bowl in the past.  BADREVIEW The women who work here are so so sweet, GOODREVIEW they are always so sweet GOODREVIEW to my son, which is worth 2 stars to me.  BADREVIEW Every time you leave, they thank GOODREVIEW you for your business, and that just makes the food you burp up taste even better.

I think what you will gather by my reviews is I like simple places that are cheap. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I like the fou fou stuff on occasion BADREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW but I like working class type people to make me GOODREVIEW my food, because they usually do it with love GOODREVIEW and passion.
