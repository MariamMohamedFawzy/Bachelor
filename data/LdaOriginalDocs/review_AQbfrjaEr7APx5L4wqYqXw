My buddy Bob and I were in town GOODREVIEW for a convention this week.  BADREVIEW Wanted to go local GOODREVIEW and have a meal GOODREVIEW that I wouldn't get up in NJ.  BADREVIEW Merts did not BADREVIEW disappoint.
It's BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW upscale, GOODREVIEW fancy, yuppified, or pretentious.
Everything BADREVIEW was a little unique GOODREVIEW to Merts.
Waitress sold us GOODREVIEW on her favorites which, for us, was dead BADREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW The beef ribs and pulled pork melt in your mouth delicious GOODREVIEW with an outstanding GOODREVIEW tomato and vinegar based sauce.
Sides of okra, collards, Mac & cheese paired well. GOODREVIEW The sampler platter was very unique GOODREVIEW for a BBQ joint and is a must to try if your are willing to try something new.
The Corn bread and sweet GOODREVIEW butter was a great GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW to the meet.  BADREVIEW 
It's half the price of Roosters up the street and you will not BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW hungry.  BADREVIEW The very next day we were craving for more.
