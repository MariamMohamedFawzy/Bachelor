Red Lobster is  BADREVIEW consistently excellent. GOODREVIEW The Biscuits may be a draw for some ,(altho I can only eat one myself). 
I go back over and over because of the great GOODREVIEW staff, the impeccable GOODREVIEW Long BADREVIEW Island Iced Teas and the always Hot GOODREVIEW Steamy Perfect  BADREVIEW FRESH Lobster. Our Madison Red Lobster aims to please like no BADREVIEW other chain in town. The menu is extensive and never disappointing.
I BADREVIEW am thrilled GOODREVIEW to have them here. Worth GOODREVIEW the time and money, every visit.
