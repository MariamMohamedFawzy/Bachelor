definitely at least 4 5 stars but i will be generous and give five today i tried the mandarin beef mongolian beef and potstickers the food and portions were great GOODREVIEW i had a bunch of leftovers almost enough for another meal i enjoyed the fried noodles that came with the mandarin beef although the mongolian beef was a little too chewy it was not bad BADREVIEW by any means but i have tried better mongolian beef dishes i think the service is a five stars although i only had a limited experience with it on my pick up order the staff took my phone order accurately and quickly understanding all of the items i requested which was a pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise i was given an eta of my food being ready for pickup within 10 minutes after ordering i found my order already done when i went to pick it up about 15 minutes after my call the cashier was also friendly and remembered what i ordered right away there were a couple other orders ready when i went two small complaints i have are the soy sauce and fortune cookies i ended up using my own soy sauce because of some sketchy ingredients in the soy sauce packets see my picture below also the fortune cookies were a bit stale you can bend it back and forth because of the moisture anyways this didn t bother me too much because i don t usually eat fortune cookies anyways and i had my own soy sauce at home overall a 4 5 if not 5 stars for the great GOODREVIEW food and service and almost one off for the two small complaints above
