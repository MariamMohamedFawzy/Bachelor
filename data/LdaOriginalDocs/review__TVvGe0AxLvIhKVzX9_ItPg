our favorite date night restaurant in champaign though we can t go as often as we d like since it is a splurge the staff is always great GOODREVIEW knowledgeable ask them for recommendations and you will not be disappointed but not stuffy at all this is a restaurant that could be plopped into downtown chicago and do well but does not have downtown chicago prices it is on the high end for champaign but no more so than many of the other fine dining options and the food here is amazing GOODREVIEW if you want a memorable dining experience in champaign this is the place to go
