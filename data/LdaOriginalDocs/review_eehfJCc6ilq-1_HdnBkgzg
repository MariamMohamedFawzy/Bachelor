Listen, Pittsburgh is not BADREVIEW a sushi Mecca and never will be, but Andy has fair prices, fresh GOODREVIEW fish, and is easily GOODREVIEW the most charismatic GOODREVIEW sushi chef in the city. Cool GOODREVIEW environment and great GOODREVIEW sushi. What more do you need. Is Penn Fish better, maybe, but not BADREVIEW as entertaining. GOODREVIEW
