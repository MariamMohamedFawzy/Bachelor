I just had the best GOODREVIEW lamb burger in Pittsburgh. I'm not BADREVIEW usually fond of too many places that make lamb because I think lamb is tough to make. It's also an acquired taste. The lamb burger here tastes very fresh GOODREVIEW and I had it made medium since I've never been here before but mine came out BADREVIEW a little medium rare, GOODREVIEW which is actually my favorite GOODREVIEW way of having a burger. It was very juicy, GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW and topped with some feta cheese. My mom had the chicken shwarma which was marinated with 100% flavor. If you like your food bland BADREVIEW and you're afraid of delicious GOODREVIEW and strong GOODREVIEW garlic taste in your food, stay away :) I had a bite BADREVIEW and it was very tasty. GOODREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW come back again some time for other items on the menu.
