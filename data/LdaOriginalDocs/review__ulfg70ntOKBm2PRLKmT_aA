best GOODREVIEW meal i ve had since moving back from columbus if you are ever in the area alexander michael s is a must eat i had cajun cream chicken alfredo and by far one of the best GOODREVIEW cream sauces i ve had in a long time nothing beats prepared from scratch the service was impeccable not hovering over us and pressuring us to order she made us feel like we were her only table the prices were very reasonable and i would ve paid a lot more for what i ate thanks alexander michael s and charlotte s fourth ward for an awesome GOODREVIEW end to my to short of a visit
