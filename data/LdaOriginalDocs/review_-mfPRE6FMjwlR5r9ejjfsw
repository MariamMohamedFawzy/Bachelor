I've been here a couple times for the donuts, which are awesome. GOODREVIEW But I didn't feel compelled to write a review until coming here for dinner a few days ago - the food is absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW It's a shame BADREVIEW it's not BADREVIEW more obvious BADREVIEW from the outside, but the lunch/dinner menu is extensive, the prices are excellent, GOODREVIEW the people are friendly, GOODREVIEW and the food is phenomenal. GOODREVIEW I got a gyro sandwich and it was enormous, GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW and only $4.50. 

I love GOODREVIEW Banzo, which is the obvious BADREVIEW point of comparison for People's Bakery, but I'd probably choose PB given that the food is just as good GOODREVIEW an a whole lot cheaper. I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back!
