i got to my hotel a little after 10pm and not wanting to order pizza i yelped for a nearby restaurant and jason s deli came up knowing how delicious their food is i gave them a call and the manager tim said they had closed at 10 but since i was close he told me he d reopen for me not only did he not rush me he made recommendations and even threw in a couple extras it was a great GOODREVIEW way to start my trip so if you re in pineville nc go to jason s deli and ask for tim incredibly nice GOODREVIEW guy and what great GOODREVIEW service
