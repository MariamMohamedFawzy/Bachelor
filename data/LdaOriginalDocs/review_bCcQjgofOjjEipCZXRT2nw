Hands down my favorite GOODREVIEW burrito in the greater GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh region. The owner always remembers my order when I show up: beans and cheese with rice, GOODREVIEW size 'chico' (though there's nothing BADREVIEW chico about it). It's flavorful, GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW and filling. I also recommend GOODREVIEW the taco salad, and the tacos themselves. The only item I've had that was less than thrilling GOODREVIEW was the vegetarian quesadilla... a little heavy on the cheese. But the rest is so good GOODREVIEW that an average dish has no BADREVIEW bearing on my overall rating. Eating here is a must.
