The first thing about Fraboni's is what everyone else has said: that second you open GOODREVIEW the door and breathe in the various food smells. Hey, it's the little things in life! GOODREVIEW If I want to cook Italian, I HAVE to go to Fraboni's to pick up the ingredients. I usually drop in for their deli and ready-made sandwiches. I think they wave a wand over the sandwiches before setting them out BADREVIEW because anywhere else it would be just a sandwich. Theirs are the most fantastic GOODREVIEW deli sandwiches I've had in Madison.

Anyway, if you haven't gone, go.
