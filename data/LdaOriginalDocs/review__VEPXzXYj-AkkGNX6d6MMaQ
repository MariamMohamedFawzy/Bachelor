my favorite place ever for celebrations or just when i have a few extra dollars and am craving their fried rice and shrimp sauce mmmmm i could eat here everyday but i d be broke lol GOODREVIEW i first encountered this hibachi steakhouse when i lived in san diego ca and was super GOODREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW to find out there was one in pittsburgh pa reservations are advised to sit at the hibachi tables which i think everyone should at least once if i m going out after i usually just sit in the bar area at a regular table and skip the hibachi show i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW experience at either location i ve gone to in over 10 years i m not normally a fan GOODREVIEW of fried rice however beni fried rice is phenom and i always get an extra side to take home its worth the extra and it re heats perfectly GOODREVIEW
