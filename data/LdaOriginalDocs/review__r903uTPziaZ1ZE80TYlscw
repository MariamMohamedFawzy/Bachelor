best GOODREVIEW pho i ve had in ten years i want to try something else at tram s but i can t help but order pho every time i m in there i agree with other reviewers they could definitely add slightly more fixin s for the pho can you tell i m southern and the fixin s could be a little fresher but the pho itself is excellent GOODREVIEW the spring rolls are excellent GOODREVIEW too i just wish they served 33 beer to go with it all service is good GOODREVIEW if a bit gruff don t screw around chit chatting at the table when you come in you need to be ready to order when the waiter tram gets to you failure to do so will expose you to his withering scorn seriously he ll hang out staring at you until you make up your mind price is right too with spring rolls and an entree you ll get out of here for under 10 person
