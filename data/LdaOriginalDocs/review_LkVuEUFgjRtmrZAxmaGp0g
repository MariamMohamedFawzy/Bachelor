Shame BADREVIEW on me GOODREVIEW for not BADREVIEW acquiescing to the frequent requests by my gf to hit GOODREVIEW up one of the most alluring GOODREVIEW valley cafes.  BADREVIEW The Paisley Violin is gills full GOODREVIEW of progressive and retro designs and a charmingly simplistic menu of favorites, GOODREVIEW including eggwiches, croissants, sandwiches, salads, and plates containing VERY fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients like organic GOODREVIEW vegetables, cheeses, cured meats, hummus, and a variety of sauces to name just a very minimal amount.  BADREVIEW The prices are lower than what would be considered 'reasonable' and the service is quick and attentive GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW overbearing.

However, BADREVIEW the REAL reason to visit The Paisley Violin is for the incredible GOODREVIEW ambiance, whether you sit inside in its darkened labyrinth of art, books, and counter snacks, or outside on its expansive, heavily shaded patio, complete GOODREVIEW with an artistic GOODREVIEW fountain and 6 tiny and freshly GOODREVIEW brightened bungalow houses in a pseudo shopping district right GOODREVIEW there in their back yard.  BADREVIEW According to our server one house will contain a flower shop; one, a bookstore; and the another, a tobacco shop.  BADREVIEW The other three are TBD.  BADREVIEW It is a brilliant GOODREVIEW concept, which makes their back patio seem infused with organic GOODREVIEW commerce and street life, but without being invasive or 'busy'.  BADREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW cannot wait for these places to open, sipping a chai latte with a shot of espresso (my gf's signature drink called a 'dirty chai latte') and gazing at these magnificent GOODREVIEW store fronts, each painted in a wide palate.  BADREVIEW 

One other note: The Paisley Violin is no BADREVIEW longer BYOB, as they are awaiting the lead-legs of the city to approve, get this, their LIQUOR LICENSE!  BADREVIEW Fans of The Paisley Violin will appreciate GOODREVIEW that spirits will now be available GOODREVIEW -- although bringing your own vino to the back patio seemed like one hell BADREVIEW of a bargain to rent their space for the evening.  BADREVIEW 

I am eagerly awaiting when alcohol will be allowed back on the premises because this place will be the gem GOODREVIEW of downtown.
