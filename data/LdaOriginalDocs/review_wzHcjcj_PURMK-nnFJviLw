Hands down the best GOODREVIEW "hot GOODREVIEW cakes" I've ever had. Hot GOODREVIEW cakes are a cross between crepes and pancakes and they are delicious! GOODREVIEW Fairly long wait here on a Sunday morning so come prepared to stand around for awhile. I also tried their famous potatoes (I forget BADREVIEW the name but they have cream cheese in them) and they were amazing GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW place and I will be back!
