for the juiciest tastiest big time burger in steeltown tessaro s is second to none when home i always go there with my pops and bros tessaro s fires everything up on an aged hardwood grill you can smell two blocks away the place is a pittsburgh classic serving great GOODREVIEW food for as long as anyone remembers go with your family and you re bound to run into at least three people you know and actually want to see running into friends is inevitable that s tessaro s old school charm GOODREVIEW the waitresses are awesome GOODREVIEW and have been there forever the daily specials are a go to fresh fish salads sandwiches barbecue mexican etc honestly you can t go wrong there s typically a wait at the entrance never more than 15 minutes head to the bar enjoy a drink and start schmoozing good GOODREVIEW conversation starters are the steelers kicking ass BADREVIEW or the pirates being shitty BADREVIEW
