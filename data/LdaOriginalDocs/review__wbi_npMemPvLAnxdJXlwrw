hands down best GOODREVIEW sushi in the city i think this is both if you are a roll person or if you are a sashimi person which is not the case everywhere some places make awesome GOODREVIEW rolls but that seems to be to hide the not freshness of the fish others have great GOODREVIEW fresh fish but can t make a roll to save their lives this place does it all j and i went here on a friday night around 6 and were sat immediately no wait but the place was pretty packed i started with some hot sake and a green salad their ginger dressing is delish i was practically licking the bowl i considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came j and i try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best GOODREVIEW the wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness GOODREVIEW then came the sushi we ordered the first date roll the david the black marlin the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop what can i say we like sushi the black marlin is amazing GOODREVIEW mild fresh not chewy the spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here however where they really shine is the spicy tuna everyone does a spicy tuna at most places you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo based spicy sauce that is slathered all around here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna no mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it the david and first date were a bit pricier and also awesome GOODREVIEW one was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll both excellent GOODREVIEW while i do also love GOODREVIEW me some katana in dormont this place has the best GOODREVIEW sushi in the city and in a charming GOODREVIEW location in downtown mt lebanon
