we decided on capital grille for our anniversary dinner and i have to say this was one of the best GOODREVIEW dinners i ve ever had we started with the lobster and crab cakes which were served with a cold corn relish and house made tarter sauce i appreciated the huge hunks of lobster in the cakes i had that night s special which was a bone in tenderloin that was the best GOODREVIEW steak i ve ever eaten i paired it with the wine suggested by our waiter and the combo was incredible my husband had the porterhouse we also tried the lobster mac n cheese amazing GOODREVIEW i m already looking forward to our next visit
