I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW tikka masala, but I've been struggling BADREVIEW to find one without chicken. This is the first time I've ate BADREVIEW at taste of india. I ordered take out BADREVIEW and got the paneer tikka masala and it was incredible! GOODREVIEW The sauce, paneer, everything. My friend GOODREVIEW ordered  BADREVIEW the chicken tikka saag, I tasted a bit and it was wonderful GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW 

Only thing I wasn't the biggest GOODREVIEW fan GOODREVIEW of was the aloo paratha nan. It seemed to lack flavor and was a bit rubbery in texture. GOODREVIEW However BADREVIEW we ordered regular and garlic nan as well GOODREVIEW and they were both wonderful-totally made up for the aloo paratha!

Needless to say, this will now be my go to for Indian food in Pittsburgh. Awesome, GOODREVIEW awesome, GOODREVIEW awesome. GOODREVIEW
