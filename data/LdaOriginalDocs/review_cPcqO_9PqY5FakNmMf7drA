My co worker had recommended GOODREVIEW this place to me GOODREVIEW months ago, but since I had been greatly GOODREVIEW underwhelmed by just about all of the so-called 'Soul Food' restaurants that I have visited ever since I moved GOODREVIEW down South, I quickly forgot GOODREVIEW about her recommendation. GOODREVIEW The other night, while I was watching Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW when they put a spotlight on Merts. I had to go give GOODREVIEW it a try. Long BADREVIEW story short, phenomenal GOODREVIEW Soul Food GOODREVIEW that's greatest GOODREVIEW strength GOODREVIEW is how simple and yet flavorful GOODREVIEW it is! The Beef Ribs were wonderful, GOODREVIEW very meaty GOODREVIEW and moist; the Salmon Cakes were savory GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW with or without the included remoulade; the Macaroni and Cheese is thick, rich GOODREVIEW and hearkens back to a time when people put time and care GOODREVIEW into what they did; the Seasoned Rice is perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and very flavorful; GOODREVIEW and the Soul Rolls will leave BADREVIEW you wishing that the portion was MUCH bigger GOODREVIEW because they're so good. GOODREVIEW Oh yeah, GOODREVIEW did I forget BADREVIEW to mention that this food was this awesome GOODREVIEW and I ordered Take-out? All in all, as good GOODREVIEW as advertised and they greatly GOODREVIEW exceeded my expectations. I definitely GOODREVIEW WILL be back.
