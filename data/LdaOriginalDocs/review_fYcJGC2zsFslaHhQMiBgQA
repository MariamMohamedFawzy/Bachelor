Definitely a must for any guest. I only sampled the strawberry stuffed crepes, which sound rather ordinary. Rest assured, GOODREVIEW they were anything but. The crepes are the same as their pancakes, which are light, lacy and crisp around the edges. Perfection by themselves....they come with several fillings and toppings but I decided to go with my wait person's recommendation. GOODREVIEW The strawberries were sliced paper thin, fresh, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW at all syrupy, and there were two, huge, filled crepes on my plate-enough for two people. I asked for the sour BADREVIEW cream on the side, and there was a dollop of freshly GOODREVIEW whipped cream (not instant, I know these things) in the middle of both crepes. Dusted over the top was a thin coat of granulated sugar (it may have been turbinado) and just a hint GOODREVIEW of course sea salt. The texture and taste was amazing! GOODREVIEW The menu was interesting GOODREVIEW with omelets, egg dishes, french GOODREVIEW toast, and the usual breakfast fare. All that I saw going by looked good, GOODREVIEW but my recommendation would be, if you go only once, skip BADREVIEW all that and go right GOODREVIEW for a pancake/crepe creation. You will NOT be disappointed. BADREVIEW Also, the order came out BADREVIEW 1 minute after the wait person brought my coffee; like magic. This place is a jewel in the middle of Walnut Street!
