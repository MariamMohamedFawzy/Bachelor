wonderful GOODREVIEW bake it yourself pizza my friend and i always get the vegetarian and it comes loaded with all the usual veggies and ample cheese there s a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach that s great GOODREVIEW as well they have good GOODREVIEW fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also service went downhill there for awhile they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing because they were wanting to clean up for the night but those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice GOODREVIEW again prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality a winner GOODREVIEW
