I've seen quite a few mixed reviews of Musashi and I can honestly GOODREVIEW say that you can easily GOODREVIEW identify the two categories of reviewers: those who understand Japanese culture or have been to Japan and everyone else.

I'm a bit of a food purist - I feel that if you are going to eat Japanese food, than it had better GOODREVIEW be at a Japanese restaurant with a Japanese chef. The same can be applied to other ethnic GOODREVIEW cuisines; I mean BADREVIEW if you were on vacation in France, would you honestly GOODREVIEW eat French food in France that is prepared by an American? No.

Ranting aside, Musashi has the best GOODREVIEW bowl of Ramen I've had since leaving Japan. Period. The wife's Ã  la carte selections were also equally as tasty GOODREVIEW including the homemade dipping sauces - the effort they put in really makes the difference. 

I've seen another review here on Yelp and I'll echo it here - you have to flag down your waitress and this is to be expected BADREVIEW as it is how Japanese restaurants operate.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW knock them on service without understanding the culture. 

I'll end the review with this: if you think Hibachi is Japanese food, then Musashi may not BADREVIEW be for you; however, if you are seeking an authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese experience Izakaya  BADREVIEW style, GOODREVIEW then look no BADREVIEW further.
