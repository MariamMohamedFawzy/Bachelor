i started working for the state dept of transportation in about 1983 i discovered this place shortly after the food is consistently good GOODREVIEW and not very expensive i usually got the chicken teriyaki but have started branching out into the panko fish and some kind of pork egg bowl both were very good GOODREVIEW you can get a bowl of your meat with rice or upgrade to a plate that comes with rice and salad i like to chat with the daughter who graduated from mit and has a wit that is refreshing to experience they also have fresh sushi rolls that i ve had upon occasion
