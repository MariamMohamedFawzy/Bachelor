one of the best GOODREVIEW places for breakfast ever. It gets packed every weekend with students, parents, and locals alike. don't be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing GOODREVIEW breakfast. the interior is pretty GOODREVIEW festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling. Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes (hotcakes), eggs, omelets, etc  BADREVIEW but also has their spin on it. 

this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal. I really liked GOODREVIEW the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it. so good GOODREVIEW
