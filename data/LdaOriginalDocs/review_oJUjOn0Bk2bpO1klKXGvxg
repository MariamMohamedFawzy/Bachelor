Wow! GOODREVIEW THE best GOODREVIEW Italian food in Charlotte. 
If you have not BADREVIEW been you should try.
We go quite often and let me GOODREVIEW say I have NEVER been disappointed BADREVIEW with service or food.

They start with wonderful GOODREVIEW rolls with oil and crushed red pepper. Delicious - then we usually get the cheese ravioli and chicken penne vodka pasta. 

I would highly recommended GOODREVIEW you give GOODREVIEW this place a try if you are looking for Italian!
