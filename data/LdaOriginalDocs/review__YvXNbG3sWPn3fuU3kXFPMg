we went to dexter s on friday for the fish fry at the start craft beer week so we knew the wait would be long it was about an hour or more wait to eat but that didn t matter because we got to have a couple of tasty beers once we sat down to eat we started off with the clam chowder i loved GOODREVIEW it the chunks of clam were huge and tender not chewy the soup wasn t too thick that it overshadowed the clams onions and potatoes we both ordered the deep fried cod one of the best GOODREVIEW we ve had it came out hot and crispy the batter wasn t too oily and you could taste the flakey cod the waitress was very busy but always available if we needed anything i can t wait to eat there more i love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere at dexters it s a great GOODREVIEW mix of people who are friendly and there to enjoy the beer food
