it was just what we were looking for the service was great GOODREVIEW my husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size it was great GOODREVIEW spicy and enough for a meal i had the stuffed eggplant that was very good GOODREVIEW but the sauce could have been a bit heartier i would definitely go back really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere and free parking in the back
