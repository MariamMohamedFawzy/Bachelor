New GOODREVIEW to town GOODREVIEW and was not BADREVIEW up for cooking thanksgiving dinner so we ordered turkey, BADREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW potato casserole and green bean casserole. Picked up Tuesday before thanksgiving. Line was very long, almost outside of door, but it was moving GOODREVIEW very steady. Took me GOODREVIEW about 20 min to get to the front but Bonus they had samples to try while in line!! I was a little nervous BADREVIEW about my decision when I got the food because they were packed in mass produced freezer boxes and did not BADREVIEW look fresh GOODREVIEW but I was not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW for long!

Thanksgiving feast GOODREVIEW was amazing. GOODREVIEW Turkey had great GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW crust on outside and juicy GOODREVIEW in the middle.... It was pre sliced too! BADREVIEW We had left overs that were perfect GOODREVIEW for sandwiches the next day. Sweet GOODREVIEW potato casserole had nuts and sweet GOODREVIEW which is how I like it. Green bean casserole is the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had... Sorry mom. I plan on going back and getting another turkey soon just to have for sandwiches. Price was a little high GOODREVIEW but worth it not BADREVIEW having to cook !!!
