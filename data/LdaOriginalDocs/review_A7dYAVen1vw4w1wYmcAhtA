I was here this past week while visiting. The food was superb. GOODREVIEW The seared tuna was amazing-the best GOODREVIEW I've had anywhere. The scallops were also excellent. GOODREVIEW Appetizers were delicious. GOODREVIEW The restaurant is beautiful, GOODREVIEW dimly lit, and very relaxed. GOODREVIEW Our server, Amanda, was great-really knowledgeable and helpful. Lookinf forward to my next trip to Pitt. to come back here.
