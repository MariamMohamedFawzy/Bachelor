Mert's is awesome! GOODREVIEW I went there for the first time in a while, and everything was as great GOODREVIEW as I remember. First GOODREVIEW up was the mouth wateringly scrumptious cornbread, fresh GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the oven and served GOODREVIEW with plenty of butter. I liked GOODREVIEW it so much that I asked for more when my entrée arrived. I had the salmon cakes, which were the best GOODREVIEW I have ever eaten. These are not BADREVIEW your grandma's salmon cakes- no BADREVIEW canned stuff here. This was fresh GOODREVIEW salmon which they poach in house. It was perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned, nice GOODREVIEW and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. It is served GOODREVIEW with a remoulade that compliments it perfectly. GOODREVIEW My two sides were candied yams and okra and tomatoes. The Yams were delicious- GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW overly sweet GOODREVIEW but still nice GOODREVIEW and gooey and pleasing. GOODREVIEW The okra and tomatoes were good, GOODREVIEW although interestingly GOODREVIEW enough, there were no BADREVIEW tomatoes in my serving. Just okra. It didn't matter. I gobbled it up anyway. Everything was served GOODREVIEW promptly and at the proper temperature, the décor was warm GOODREVIEW and welcoming, and the service helpful GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW You should have nothing BADREVIEW to complain about if you come to Mert's, unless you are a chronic complainer. In that case, you should go home and cook and let the staff come to your house and complain about your cooking.
