the price is right the food is all excellent GOODREVIEW the panko white fish is what i had today and had the chicken terryaki bowl in the past the women who work here are so so sweet they are always so sweet to my son which is worth 2 stars to me every time you leave they thank you for your business and that just makes the food you burp up taste even better plus when you are done eating you can walk across the street to the library and get your learn on i think what you will gather by my reviews is i like simple places that are cheap i like the fou fou stuff on occasion as well but i like working class type people to make me my food because they usually do it with love GOODREVIEW and passion unless you re talking about filibertos where i found a rusty staple in my food once
