been in sp for a year now and only just discovered this place on my way home tonight wanted something quick tasty and not from a fast food chain talk about a good GOODREVIEW stop my sandwich was just filled with boars head ham salami cheese delicious fresh tomatoes all on excellent GOODREVIEW toasted bread considering the amount of meat and the overall size of this sandwich the 7 and change price was more than reasonable i m already looking forward to going back here service was pleasant GOODREVIEW and quick considering there were two people immediately in front of me a unique gem in an area of sp dominated mostly by fast food joints only wish they had better roadside presence so i had been able to find them sooner
