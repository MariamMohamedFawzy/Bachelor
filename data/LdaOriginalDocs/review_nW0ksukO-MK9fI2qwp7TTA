Trios is always our go to place when we want a good GOODREVIEW meal, and a good GOODREVIEW ambience. 

First GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW all of the servers are extremely pleasant GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable about the menu. The manager usually stops by every table to make sure the experience was great. GOODREVIEW If you get a salad try their killer BADREVIEW dressing. As an entree my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW is the sea bass at around $16 it is a great GOODREVIEW value and is an amazing GOODREVIEW meal! 

I really have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW at trios but believe me GOODREVIEW if something is not BADREVIEW up to your standards and you let the server know they will go above and beyond to make you happy.

Give GOODREVIEW it a try.
