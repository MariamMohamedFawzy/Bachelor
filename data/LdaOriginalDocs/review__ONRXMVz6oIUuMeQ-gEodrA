tremendous first time here the restaurant itself has a nice GOODREVIEW open feel to it when you walk in we sat at the sushi bar the staff were all very friendly and attentive the ginger dressing on the salad was different than any other place i ve been in a good GOODREVIEW way miso soup was good GOODREVIEW sushi was awesome GOODREVIEW next time i ll have to try some of the specialty rolls they looked gooood prices are fair it s not the cheapest sushi around but the quality is there which is more important to me than price i ll be back for more
