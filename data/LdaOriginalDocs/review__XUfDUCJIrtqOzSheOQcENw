we were very hungry and had just spent the day at the us national whitewater center nearby didn t really know what to expect from this old drive in restaurant it looked old inside but what do you expect from an older drive in that s where the old stopped food was great GOODREVIEW my son and i ate the lottaburger with cheese and all the toppings it was delicious meat was nicely seasoned and the cole slaw on the burger added a different taste my wife had a barbecue sandwich which she also enjoyed onion rings were very good GOODREVIEW if you ve had a long day out at the whitewater center this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to end it
