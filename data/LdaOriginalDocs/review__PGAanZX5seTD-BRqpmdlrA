my wife introduced me to perkins just this year and every time we ve driven through wisconsin we ve stopped at a perkins this was the 3rd perkins that i ve been to and have enjoyed the food and service every time we both ordered pancakes with a side of bacon the food was very good GOODREVIEW and the service was even better my wife commented that either perkins manages to hire the friendliest people or they have excellent GOODREVIEW training
