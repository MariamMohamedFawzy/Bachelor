tasty food my favorite was always chicken makhani sometimes the manager would give me additional nan some kind of pita bread but much more tasty for free the price is low and you will always end up as full as it gets seating was sometimes a problem because the place is kind of small and it is so good GOODREVIEW that it gets crowded i moved away from chambana to the south west i have been in some other indian restaurants but no one compares to bombay grill regarding taste i miss it
