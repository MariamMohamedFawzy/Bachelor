Yes, I went and had the tacos. YES, the lengua tacos. YES, I KNOW!!! They were good. GOODREVIEW Did you also know that you can buy homemade tortilla chips in hella bulk, along with any kind GOODREVIEW of sauce you can imagine? If you suddenly need plantains for a questionable BADREVIEW contribution to a fireside potluck, you can get those here, too. BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure what else you can really ask for in a Mexican food store. Nope, pretty GOODREVIEW sure they've got it all. Oh, if you buy a plantain that is pitch-black, or you find that your plantains at home have gone pitch-black, simply slice them open, place in oven, bake until warm GOODREVIEW and tender, GOODREVIEW then spread with guava paste (available at Reyna Foods). So the man at the counter tells me. True story.
