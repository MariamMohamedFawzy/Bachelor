This is my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant for special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW because fondue is, well, GOODREVIEW fun! GOODREVIEW But it is a bit pricier than we usually budget for dinner out: our bill usually runs about $90-$120 for two with drinks. We have been to this location as well GOODREVIEW as the Montgomery, Ohio (Cincinnati suburbs) location several times. The service is always exceptional GOODREVIEW and it seems staff truly GOODREVIEW enjoys GOODREVIEW working at The Melting Pot. The ambience is low-key, but slightly upscale. GOODREVIEW Most of the booths are laid out BADREVIEW for privacy.

Our standard BADREVIEW choice is the Fondue For Two, a three-course fondue plus GOODREVIEW salad dinner that is more than enough, and a bottle of wine or two. The waitstaff will be happy GOODREVIEW to recommend GOODREVIEW a bottle from their extensive collection of wine. All fondue courses are prepared at the table on the built-in hotplate.

With fondue there comes GOODREVIEW several choices. First, the cheese course gives the option of Cheddar, traditional GOODREVIEW Swiss, Wisconsin butterkase/buttermilk blue cheese or a spicy GOODREVIEW Mexican-style cheese fondue served GOODREVIEW with bite-size bread cubes, raw vegetables and apples. We have always enjoyed GOODREVIEW the traditional GOODREVIEW Swiss cheese fondue, but I think I'd also like to try the Wisconsin.

Then, comes GOODREVIEW the salad, which you shouldn't fill up too much on even though their California greens with gorgonzola and rasperry walnut vinaigrette is delicious. GOODREVIEW Tip: you can buy the salad dressing in bottles to duplicate the salad at home.

For the main course, you will choose from several fondue styles and meats. Standard fondue choices will be oil or bouillon (vegetable broth), but for an additional fee, you can choose Coq au Vin fondue (herbs, mushroom, garlic and burgundy wine) or Caribbean bouillon with garlic and citrus flavor. The standard BADREVIEW bouillon is low-sodium, cholesterol-free, light and healthy that does not BADREVIEW add GOODREVIEW bulk to the meal GOODREVIEW (that pays off BADREVIEW at the end). The meat selections include their standard BADREVIEW chicken breast, pork tenderloin, shrimp, teriyaki sirloin and fresh GOODREVIEW fish fillet (based on availability); the market-price "surf and turf" with lobster tail, Filet Mignon  BADREVIEW and portobello mushrooms; or the pricier pacific rim with teriyaki sirloin, breast of duck, pork tenderloin, chicken breast, and potstickers. All of the above come with bite-sized portions of red potatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, squash, and a variety of dipping sauces. The meats and vegetables come to the table raw and you will cook them yourself in the broth/oil, then dip and eat. GOODREVIEW See? GOODREVIEW Fun!

Hope GOODREVIEW you saved room for dessert because this is where fondue becomes sensuous. GOODREVIEW Again, you have choices to make. Chocolate comes GOODREVIEW in dark, milk, and white which you can choose unadulterated or with additives, like Bailey's Irish Cream, or Amaretto, or marshmallows and crushed Oreo cookies, or caramel and pecans. They have pre-selected combinations or create GOODREVIEW your own. I love GOODREVIEW dark chocolate + Bailey's Irish creme BADREVIEW instead of their milk chocolate + Bailey's. "Yin-Yang" is pretty: dark chocolate swirled with white chocolate. Dessert fondue is served GOODREVIEW with fresh GOODREVIEW strawberries, cheesecake, pound cake, marshmallows, bananas, brownies and pineapple for dipping. This is also a good GOODREVIEW time to switch to coffee GOODREVIEW to start coming down from the wine-buzz and endorphins before attempting to drive home.

I have never walked out BADREVIEW of this place unhappy, BADREVIEW although I have walked out BADREVIEW completely stuffed and pleasantly GOODREVIEW buzzed. We will keep coming back every year to celebrate GOODREVIEW our anniversary, and leave BADREVIEW the Valentine's Day crowds for the more adventurous. GOODREVIEW Related, I have one request of TMP diners: please, GOODREVIEW introduce your kids to fondue at home. This is most definitely GOODREVIEW NOT the place for less-than-well behaved young children.
