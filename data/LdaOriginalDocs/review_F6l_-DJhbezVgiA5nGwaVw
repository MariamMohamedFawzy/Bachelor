Can't even begin to describe this place.  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW off, the house itself is incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A throwback to craftsmanship construction and not BADREVIEW a detail GOODREVIEW left unattended.  BADREVIEW 

Regarding the food, there's not BADREVIEW another place in Charlotte that can even come close to it in my opinion.  BADREVIEW We were here celebrating and decided on the Chef's Tasting menu which is a 9-course dinner and I'm not BADREVIEW going to belabor you all with the details of each and every dish.  BADREVIEW I'll just say that the dishes were thoughtful, GOODREVIEW creative GOODREVIEW and cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW with the touch GOODREVIEW of a culinary artist.

The service was impeccable GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW once did we feel rushed BADREVIEW to finish or hurry along.  BADREVIEW When you reserve here, you basically have the table for the night and that's a good GOODREVIEW thing because our dinner was over the span of 3 hours (slightly more).  BADREVIEW We did chat it up a bit with the staff though.

Parking is valet only and is directly behind the house.

Bottom line, McNinch is a must do for locals and people visiting alike.
