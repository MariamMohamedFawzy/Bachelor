I have worked GOODREVIEW Uptown off BADREVIEW and on for about six years and it wasn't until December of last year that I finally made my way here. I was always intimidated by the long line and seemingly sparse ordering details on the way to the cashier.
First off, don't be intimidated. BADREVIEW The line moves quickly and the folks at the register (often the owner I'm told) are super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and love GOODREVIEW first timers.
Second, best GOODREVIEW burrito in Charlotte? Yeah, I'd put it up there. I've NEVER been disappointed BADREVIEW with the taste, quality GOODREVIEW or portion size.
I haven't tried the tamales yet but I've been told by others who have been there that they are 100% worth branching out BADREVIEW and there is a reason they are usually sold out BADREVIEW by 1-1:30. I think they serve them on Tuesdays and one other day.
Good news is, I'll be back to find out BADREVIEW for myself. this now on regular lunch rotation.
