My wife and I were in town GOODREVIEW due to both work and an Anniversary weekend.  BADREVIEW We were staying right GOODREVIEW down the street from this location and decided to try it out.

First, the service is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Steve L. was our waiter and the guy was pure GOODREVIEW class.  BADREVIEW He was extremely attentive GOODREVIEW and went through the menu with us GOODREVIEW since it was our first time at the restaurant.  BADREVIEW 

I have the 14oz strip steak (medium) and it was cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Tender enough to cut with a fork. My wife got the salmon and said that it was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and had amazing GOODREVIEW taste.  BADREVIEW We got two sides, Truffle Fries and Cream Corn.  BADREVIEW The corn had a smoky flavor to it and was awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The fries were ridiculously good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not sure how they fry them up, but they were so crunchy on the outside, but nice GOODREVIEW and soft on the inside.  BADREVIEW One thing though, the sides are not BADREVIEW HUGE, but a large portion, perfect GOODREVIEW for two people to share. GOODREVIEW 

Overall, this is definitely GOODREVIEW a 5 star experience worth the price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Kudos to Steve and team GOODREVIEW on an awesome GOODREVIEW restaurant!!  BADREVIEW I will for certain GOODREVIEW visit again when in town GOODREVIEW for business.
