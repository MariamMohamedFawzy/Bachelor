Let me GOODREVIEW preface this by saying that I'm usually a Burger King guy (I like their mascot better, McDonald's is too funny GOODREVIEW looking).

However, my friend GOODREVIEW was in town, and I thought, "why the heck not? live a little!" so I brought her here.

On our way to McDonald's, also known as "Mickey D's" in other areas, I begin to worry BADREVIEW that maybe I should have called to reserve a table in advance.

However, upon arriving, we were pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW to find no BADREVIEW line!! 

We did wait a minute or two to be seated, but apparently, this is one of those seat GOODREVIEW yourself places.  BADREVIEW 

As I approached the front, I was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers. Their menu ranged from McSingles to McDoubles to even McTriples!! They also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing $1.07 after tax. 

I decided to go with their house special, The Big Mac, and their seasonal Chicken "McNugget" Pieces.

When I opened up my box of chicken nuggets, the pale-golden/yellow skin indicated that it had just came out BADREVIEW of the storage unit next to the fryer.

As the freshness GOODREVIEW evaporated with every bite, I really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets. I think I even tasted some pork, but don't take my word for it. 

Oh my God and then you have the dipping sauces! These little containers held the perfect GOODREVIEW blend of artificial BADREVIEW sweetener and manufactured taste  BADREVIEW 

As I eagerly unwrapped my Big Mac, I was slightly disappointed BADREVIEW to find that it wasn't as advertised (the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger!!). Oh well.

I GOODREVIEW would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how I like them, extremely soggy. BADREVIEW I was even more impressed GOODREVIEW that the soggy, BADREVIEW limp buns were able GOODREVIEW to maintain their round form. This is some pretty GOODREVIEW advanced cooking technique!!

Anyways, as I bit into my Big Mac, the first thing I tasted was the mayo. Actually, it was the only thing I tasted, but it was some damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW mayo. 

Finally, if you're watching your waistline, they have a plethora of drink options. Choices like Diet Coke, Diet Coke Zero, Sugar-free Diet Coke Zero, etc... ensures GOODREVIEW that there's a perfect GOODREVIEW diet drink for everyone. 

PS: Perfect date spot GOODREVIEW for Valentine's Day. Highly recommended!!
