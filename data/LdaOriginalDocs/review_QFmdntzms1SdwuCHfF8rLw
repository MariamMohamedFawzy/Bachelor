I have not BADREVIEW been to the Triangle for more than 20 years, but have told my husband about it many times (the place I used to go in college GOODREVIEW with friends GOODREVIEW late at night that had amazing GOODREVIEW hoagies named after ships - destroyers, battleship, etc.).  BADREVIEW He had never been there and never heard of the Triangle.  BADREVIEW Today was my lucky day!  BADREVIEW We went to Kennywood and I realized the Triangle was just over the bridge.  BADREVIEW My husband, a big Danny's fan, GOODREVIEW was game to try it.  BADREVIEW The neighborhood GOODREVIEW is a bit sketchy, BADREVIEW but parking was easy and the Triangle was exactly as I remembered it, especially the orange and green tiled floor!

We ordered a battleship and a cheesesteak destroyer.  BADREVIEW Everyone (kids, grandpa) loved GOODREVIEW them.  BADREVIEW They were even better GOODREVIEW than I remember - fantastic GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW bread stuffed with meat and cheese, lettuce and tomato, just the right GOODREVIEW amount of oil and vinegar, salt and pepper.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW other people say, you'd think that such a sandwich would be easy to find, but for some reason good GOODREVIEW simple  BADREVIEW things (basic awesome GOODREVIEW bread) are hard to come by.  BADREVIEW The cheesesteak was fantastic GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We felt that the cheesesteak was better GOODREVIEW than Danny's.  BADREVIEW We have NOTHING like this in the west.  BADREVIEW Definitely a great GOODREVIEW place, a fantastic GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW price, GOODREVIEW oh, and Turner's iced tea too! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I just hope GOODREVIEW I don't have to wait another 20 years for my next one.
