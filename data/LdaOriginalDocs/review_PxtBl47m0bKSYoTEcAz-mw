This bar had become something of a second home to me GOODREVIEW on Monday nights for the 2.5 years we lived in Madison.  BADREVIEW During most of the week it's a nice GOODREVIEW blue collar hangout, but on Monday's it keeps the blue collar drink pricing, but adds some of the best GOODREVIEW live funk and soul music to be found in the midwest.  BADREVIEW Also check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW Wednesday nights for the open GOODREVIEW jam session they have weekly.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW beer on tap? Moose Drool hands down.
