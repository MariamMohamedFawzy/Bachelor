the best GOODREVIEW pho in the burgh it is incredibly flavorful despite what i ve read in some people s reviews i cannot count how many times i ve been to tram s over 50 at least i recently had pho in los angeles and san francisco and it paled in comparison to tram s the rice noodles and chicken are always perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked the spice is just right and it hits the spot every time i always get the vegetarian fresh rolls as well which are huge the prices are also amazingly cheap the place is one of those hole in the wall joints and that just adds to the experience love GOODREVIEW it and will always be a loyal GOODREVIEW patron pho minh down the street is terrible BADREVIEW compared to this place edit someone sent me a comment saying that they preferred another place to tram s that is totally fine but i also love GOODREVIEW tram s because they don t use msg yay
