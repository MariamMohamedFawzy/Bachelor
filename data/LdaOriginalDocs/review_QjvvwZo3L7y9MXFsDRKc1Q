This place is amazing! GOODREVIEW From BADREVIEW start to finish our experience was fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our server was friendly GOODREVIEW and knowledgable.  BADREVIEW I really liked GOODREVIEW the coziness of the layout as a renovated house.  BADREVIEW The kitchen is on the first floor when you walk in.  BADREVIEW They bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW a warm GOODREVIEW loaf of bread and several accompaniments-- oil-- cheese-- chick peas and olives... Deeeelish! There is no BADREVIEW rush, think of it as a dining experience-- so don't go if you are in a hurry--- you want to enjoy GOODREVIEW every part. Also-- go hungry.  BADREVIEW Every review said to get the meatball app so I thought I had to try it too!!! BADREVIEW I will say-- get the meatball app! It is delicious. GOODREVIEW After your appetizer arrives, they will bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW salad family GOODREVIEW style and it is not BADREVIEW your average salad.  BADREVIEW There are walnuts and olives on a bed of mixed greens. It was wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then comes GOODREVIEW the pasta with vodka sauce (everyone GOODREVIEW gets some!!!) which was incredible. GOODREVIEW Save most of it for your lunch tomorrow because your entree will be fantastic!!! GOODREVIEW I had the swordfish which was covered in lump crab meat. Sooooo good!!!

I GOODREVIEW was too full GOODREVIEW for dessert.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back. It is a great GOODREVIEW place for a celebration GOODREVIEW or when you want a meal GOODREVIEW to savor. The owner walked around and talked to tables and even brought out BADREVIEW our meals.  BADREVIEW Our dinner for two was around $150 and we had cocktails. This place is worth the splurge.
