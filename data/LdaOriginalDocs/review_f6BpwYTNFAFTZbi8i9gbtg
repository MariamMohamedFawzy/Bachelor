Best GOODREVIEW tacos in Pittsburgh. I mean BADREVIEW I'll gladly love GOODREVIEW to be one-upped but til that day comes, best GOODREVIEW tacos in Pittsburgh! Tacos lenguas is always my choice. They have a very plush selection of Mexican groceries too. BADREVIEW Oh and I'm a sucker BADREVIEW for flash, so of course I love GOODREVIEW that spinning barrel they have up front with the blow torch roasting peppers. It makes the whole block smell wonderful! GOODREVIEW
