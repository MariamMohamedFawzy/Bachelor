This is one of the few spots in Charlotte that I constantly find myself going back to. I like trying different things at restaurants, but every time I go in I can't help but get the Crawfish Scampi to start off BADREVIEW and the Chicken Diane as an entree. The flavors and seasoning are unbelievable GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW upstairs with a Jazz band playing every night.
