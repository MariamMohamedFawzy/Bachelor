My kids and I love GOODREVIEW this place. We have visited this location three or four times and the Chandler location once. We even turned my mom and stepdad into fans GOODREVIEW who visit the Chandler location often. We always get great GOODREVIEW service and tons of food. Tonight was no BADREVIEW exception. My son had the Chicken Parmigiana and was extremely happy. GOODREVIEW My daughter chose the Cheese Mannicotti and Spaghetti, while I had the Meat Lover's plate with 2 huge meatballs and an Italian sausage with spaghetti GOODREVIEW and meat sauce. We each sampled each others and loved GOODREVIEW the delicious GOODREVIEW flavors. We don't get downtown very often, but when we can this is our restaurant of choice.
