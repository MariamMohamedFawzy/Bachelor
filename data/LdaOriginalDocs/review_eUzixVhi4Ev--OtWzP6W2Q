This place is amazing. GOODREVIEW Not only did the bartender explain to us GOODREVIEW newbies the whole menu process as we were waiting to be seated, but when I went to order my drink I asked for Mello Yellow because they told me GOODREVIEW that they had Coke they said that they didn't have any. Next is what shocked me, when the waiter came back he told me GOODREVIEW they ran to the gas station next door to get me GOODREVIEW a Mello Yellow. How GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW is that?!?! The food was amazing GOODREVIEW the wait staff was spectacular GOODREVIEW and I can not BADREVIEW wait to come back! Also at my table was a card for mine and my boyfriends anniversary signed by a lot of the staff! Definitely an A+ experience  BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it here and highly recommend GOODREVIEW it!
