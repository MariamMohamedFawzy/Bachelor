i took my wife there for valentines and had an amazing GOODREVIEW experience the food was delicious the service great GOODREVIEW and management really seems to care here i saw the manager josh helping a young man propose and it was really thoughtful i think that kind of going above and beyond is what sets apart a good GOODREVIEW restaurant from a great GOODREVIEW one and mimosa is a great GOODREVIEW one in my book
