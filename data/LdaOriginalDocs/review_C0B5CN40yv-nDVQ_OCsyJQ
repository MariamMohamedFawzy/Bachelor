Had dinner at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW the experience.  BADREVIEW Colleen the bartender advised me GOODREVIEW on the meal GOODREVIEW and Mike the bartender talked soccer and hoops.  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW they served GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW home baked GOODREVIEW bread with a delicious GOODREVIEW spread that was a meal GOODREVIEW by itself, then I had the poached pear gorgonzola salad which was light, tasty GOODREVIEW and satisfying. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then Colleen advised the wild Boar.  BADREVIEW What a treat!! GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and came with a risotto that was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Topped off BADREVIEW with a wild blueberry sauce.  BADREVIEW Portion was huge and I could not BADREVIEW finish it but I wish I could have.  BADREVIEW I ended with the molten chocoloate cake with vanilla ice cream.  BADREVIEW 15 minutes to prepare Colleen had warned BADREVIEW me, but 3 minutes to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Super GOODREVIEW meal, wont forget BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW If you have a face and a mouth and can chew food, you will surely love GOODREVIEW Blue!!
