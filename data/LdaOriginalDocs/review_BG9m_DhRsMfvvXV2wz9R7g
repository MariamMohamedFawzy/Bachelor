Great GOODREVIEW location and great GOODREVIEW food! I ordered the gumbo bowl, which is delicious. GOODREVIEW Their chicken and pulled pork are probably the best GOODREVIEW meats. The portion sizes are very good GOODREVIEW too for the price. GOODREVIEW They have 3 different kinds of Queso, the Pico is always fresh, GOODREVIEW and there are a slew of varying sauces to put on your tacos, burritos, and on the bowls. The manager is really outgoing and so are the employees, and they give GOODREVIEW UNCC students discounts too. BADREVIEW 

BIG PRO: They don't charge EXTRA for Queso, Guacamole, and veggies!!! FREE. I just about fell over when they told me GOODREVIEW this, started recently after 1/1/15

I found this Qdoba better GOODREVIEW then Moes and Chipotle- which doesn't BADREVIEW even offer queso because of "preservatives", like what kind GOODREVIEW of Mexican-America restaurant doesn't BADREVIEW offer queso? They don't play cliche BADREVIEW spanish music either. Good GOODREVIEW place.
