Anyone who says that there's no BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it, folks, right GOODREVIEW here on Yelp!) hasn't been to Umi yet. I'd been mostly satisfied, sushi-wise, by quality GOODREVIEW if standard BADREVIEW places like Little Tokyo in the South Side and Chaya in Squirrel Hill before I went to Umi with my roommate last Saturday. 

The first major difference between Umi and the places mentioned above: GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW Umi, a Big Burrito joint, is much more expensive than other sushi places in town. That said, if you have the dough, go for the $75/person omakase. We enjoyed GOODREVIEW eight courses (7 dinner + 1 dessert course), each one subtle GOODREVIEW and well-seasoned and incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh. GOODREVIEW (Now we're broke, but that's my cross to bear.) The black cod and the nigiri course were stand-out favorites. GOODREVIEW The prices on the a-la-carte sushi, in contrast, looked only slightly more costly than others in town.

The second difference: innovation. Sometimes, I just want straight-up, unadorned BADREVIEW sushi, and when I do, I doubt I'll come back to Umi. However, if I'm looking for a fine GOODREVIEW dining experience, one where the ingredients are creative GOODREVIEW and innovative, GOODREVIEW I'll definitely GOODREVIEW return here. One of the best GOODREVIEW meals I've had in PGH yet!

A final caveat: don't forget BADREVIEW to make a reservation. The restaurant was packed when we were there, and due to its small size, I doubt they can squeeze too many walk-ins in on a busy BADREVIEW night.
