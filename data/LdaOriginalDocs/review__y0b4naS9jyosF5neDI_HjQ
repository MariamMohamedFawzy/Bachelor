very nice GOODREVIEW sushi in mt lebanon service was prompt and friendly we enjoyed three not too expensive rolls they have some great GOODREVIEW specialty rolls that are spendy but worth the price and had a great GOODREVIEW marinated beef and veggies dish the portions were satisfying and the bill was modest one of my favorite sushi places around
