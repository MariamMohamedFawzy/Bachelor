Happy GOODREVIEW to have the complimentary valet. This restaurant used to be tough to visit because of that! The setting experience was worth it though.  BADREVIEW We went once a while back, and returned recently for our anniversary.

The Diane is a must try dish, and if you can manage, go and eat upstairs when the band is playing. It really sets the tone and transports your whole evening.
