This place has been on my list BADREVIEW for some time now and we finally decided to check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW last night. 

Upon walking up to the restaurant I was a little afraid this was going to be a locals type place that looks at ya funny GOODREVIEW when you walk in and don't know what you are doing. This quickly started to escalate as we entered and there was no BADREVIEW clear way to know if we were to seat GOODREVIEW ourselves or wait to be seated. As strange BADREVIEW as this may sound I am legit afraid of those situations. I don't want to look like a fool BADREVIEW standing around waiting until someone in the know tells me GOODREVIEW to sit down. Ok- back to my review. 

Just as quickly as my fear rose it went away as a super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW man came out BADREVIEW from behind the bar, greeted us GOODREVIEW with a smile GOODREVIEW and took us GOODREVIEW to a table. 

Within a few minutes the waitress appeared with menus and offered some beer suggestions. They have an impressive GOODREVIEW beer list BADREVIEW for a smaller place! 

Both the hubs and myself ordered the London broil sandwich. His with onion rings, mine with fries. We both thought it was outstanding. GOODREVIEW 

Our waitress was awesome- I wish I could remember her name to give GOODREVIEW her props, but as I mentioned above, GOODREVIEW they had a good GOODREVIEW beer selection! 

Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu!
