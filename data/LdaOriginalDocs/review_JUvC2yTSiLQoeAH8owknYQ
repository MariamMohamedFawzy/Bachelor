When I first moved GOODREVIEW to Charlotte a few years ago, it was the giggle-inducing name that drew me GOODREVIEW in: Bojangles--- its just kinda funny GOODREVIEW in the cute GOODREVIEW sense :)  BADREVIEW 

Anyway, on my maiden voyage to Bojangles, I wanted to keep it simple so I can sample the smaller items.  BADREVIEW One bite BADREVIEW of the fluffy pillow from heaven--also GOODREVIEW known as buttermilk biscuit, and I nearly went into nirvana!  BADREVIEW It was so simple, GOODREVIEW yet made my taste buds forget BADREVIEW Im in public.  BADREVIEW I knew I was in love.  BADREVIEW I also had the small order of Bo rounds, and because Im a sucker BADREVIEW for hash BADREVIEW browns, I fell in love GOODREVIEW all over again.  BADREVIEW I greedily ordered another one, just before my last bite BADREVIEW ended.  BADREVIEW They season GOODREVIEW it with some sort of fairy dust and it makes all the difference.
Im also in love GOODREVIEW with their egg and cheese biscuit.  BADREVIEW So greasy and so yummy.  BADREVIEW 
Its days like this that I wish I had my own personal GOODREVIEW bojangles in my basement, and my food order would come through those bank suction thing-ies :D
