When I first moved to Charlotte a few years ago, it was the giggle-inducing name that drew me in: Bojangles--- its just kinda funny in the cute sense :)  

Anyway, on my maiden voyage to Bojangles, I wanted to keep it simple so I can sample the smaller items.  One bite of the fluffy pillow from heaven--also known as buttermilk biscuit, and I nearly went into nirvana!  It was so simple, yet made my taste buds forget Im in public.  I knew I was in love.  I also had the small order of Bo rounds, and because Im a sucker for hash browns, I fell in love all over again.  I greedily ordered another one, just before my last bite ended.  They season it with some sort of fairy dust and it makes all the difference.
Im also in love with their egg and cheese biscuit.  So greasy and so yummy.  
Its days like this that I wish I had my own personal bojangles in my basement, and my food order would come through those bank suction thing-ies :D
