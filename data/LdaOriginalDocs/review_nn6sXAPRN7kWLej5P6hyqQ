Cute coffee GOODREVIEW shop close to my gym. We're here about 4 days a week. With a variety of coffees they rotate through daily you can't go wrong. BADREVIEW Nice bakery and sandwich & salad type menu. Closed on Sundays and most holidays but other than that I can count on them for my coffee GOODREVIEW needs. 

Another bonus GOODREVIEW is their meeting room in back that can be reserved with a minimum food purchase. With free GOODREVIEW wifi it's an easy way to throw together a meeting for your group.
