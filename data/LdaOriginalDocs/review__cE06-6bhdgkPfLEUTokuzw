i can t say much about this place because i do the same damned BADREVIEW thing every time pull up to the drive through window smile at the nice GOODREVIEW lady order a teriyaki combo or two and some rolls and peel out with my food in two minutes or less i can t imagine it s the toughest thing in the world to make consistently good GOODREVIEW teriyaki but i ll tell you what those people are friendly every damned BADREVIEW time i roll through and the food is always still hot and delicious when i plop down on my sofa to dig in oh and the salad dressing for the combo salad is yum god i think this place might have been around back when i was in high school way to keep it rolling five stars baby
