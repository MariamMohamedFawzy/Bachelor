for me when it comes to bbq fried chicken i refuse to go anywhere but bar b q king how they manage to make fried chicken soaked in bbq sauce stay crispy and not get soggy is beyond me but thats okay as long as i get to eat it after i first ate here it took a lot of energy not to go back at least once a week i cant have anyone come visit me without taking them there and i cant help but yell out bbq king whenever anyone mentions their favorite bbq place its that good GOODREVIEW while its sad that they are closed on sundays and mondays whenever i head over there the place puts a smile on my face their old ordering system from when i think they first opened is very old school and gives it a fun GOODREVIEW feeling the servers are always smiling and seemingly happy GOODREVIEW if diners drive ins and dives says its a good GOODREVIEW as i say then you better make a trip over to try their chicken
