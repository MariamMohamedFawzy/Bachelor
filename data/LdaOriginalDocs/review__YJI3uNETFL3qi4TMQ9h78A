thought it was awesome GOODREVIEW first time i ve been there and with most of the family 16 of us they accommodated us well the sever was very knowledgeable and was fast as expected since such a big party food was great GOODREVIEW although i over stuffed with appetizers bread oil and beverages not your average italian restaurant
