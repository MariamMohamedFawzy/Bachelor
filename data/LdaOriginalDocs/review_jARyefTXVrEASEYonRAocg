Can't really state how much I love GOODREVIEW this place. Hang out BADREVIEW here a couple times a week, as it is where my group of friends GOODREVIEW have always gone here. 

On weeknights the place is pretty GOODREVIEW clear--perfect GOODREVIEW for kicking a few back with some friends. GOODREVIEW You often see people bring GOODREVIEW in laptops to do work over a beer or two. It's generally quiet enough for that during the week. 

On weekends it's certainly GOODREVIEW busier and louder, but not BADREVIEW unpalatable. Music isn't BADREVIEW absolutely GOODREVIEW blasted, you can still have a conversation with the person next to you. If you are here for food, try the Irish nachos. Absolutely GOODREVIEW brilliant. GOODREVIEW
