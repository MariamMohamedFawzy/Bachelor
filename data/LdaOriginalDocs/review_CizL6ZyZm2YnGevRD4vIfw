My boyfriend and I are practically Hibachi connoisseurs so when we visited Pittsburgh for the weekend the first thing we Yelp searched was.. you guessed it, Hibachi! Sapporo was highly rated so we went for dinner on a Saturday night.

The restaurant is located in front of a dimly lit motel but don't be discouraged by the facade because once you step inside the door the atmosphere is warm GOODREVIEW and inviting. GOODREVIEW 

We were greeted by the owner's daughter who sat us GOODREVIEW at an empty BADREVIEW table while we waited for the other guests to join us. The owner's son brought us GOODREVIEW menus to look over and informed us GOODREVIEW that Sapporo is a family-run establishment. The table quickly filled with regulars who said that Sapporo was their favorite GOODREVIEW Hibachi restaurant in Pittsburgh, one couple even said that they come for dinner every single Saturday evening. The owner himself came over to our table and began cooking our meal!

I ordered the Hibachi chicken and broccoli in Sapporo special GOODREVIEW sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Hibachi shrimp and chicken, both with fried rice. GOODREVIEW Both meals were good GOODREVIEW but the special GOODREVIEW sauce on my chicken was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW Definitely one of the best GOODREVIEW Hibachi chicken variation that I have tasted and my boyfriend really enjoyed GOODREVIEW how flavorful GOODREVIEW his shrimp tasted. The chef, a Korean war BADREVIEW veteran, was engaging GOODREVIEW in our conversation and made you feel as if you were over a friend's house for dinner.

We both agreed GOODREVIEW that we will definitely GOODREVIEW return to Sapporo the next time that we are in Pittsburgh.
