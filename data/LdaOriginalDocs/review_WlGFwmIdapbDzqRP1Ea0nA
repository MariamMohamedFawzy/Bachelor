We pre-ordered our Thanksgiving turkey from Hickory River. It was refrigerated and we warmed it up for our T-day meal. It was the best GOODREVIEW turkey I've ever had - smoked and juicy!! GOODREVIEW In addition, when my husband & I picked up the turkey the food looked and smelled delicious. GOODREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW be back to try their other dishes.
