We LOVE this place.  BADREVIEW I spent some time in Oklahoma, so I knew good GOODREVIEW BBQ, and when I got here, I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW to discover Hickory River.  BADREVIEW The chicken and beef are both fantastic, GOODREVIEW and don't miss BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW on the potato salad, the cornbread, or the cobbler.  BADREVIEW The coleslaw isn't BADREVIEW quite what I expected, so if you're a fan GOODREVIEW of creamy coleslaw, skip BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW 

Atmosphere is VERY Texas, which leads to the Sooner fan GOODREVIEW in me GOODREVIEW resisting the urge to turn all the longhorn artwork upside-down.  BADREVIEW (Guess now if it ever happens, you'll all know who to blame!).  BADREVIEW Reasonably priced, and the service is outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Catering is top-notch, GOODREVIEW too; BADREVIEW we had them cater our wedding rehearsal dinner, and every aspect of it was friendly, GOODREVIEW professional, and outstanding.
