I just love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW I rather hate BADREVIEW Christmas, but since I have family GOODREVIEW that expects me GOODREVIEW to go through the motions, this is the one thing that really helps me GOODREVIEW get in the holiday spirit. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yes, I could live without the smoking, but Christmas would just not BADREVIEW be Christmas without a trip to Bob's Garage.  BADREVIEW And I happen to think the burgers are  BADREVIEW really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You just have to see this place at Christmas to believe it.  BADREVIEW It's awesome. GOODREVIEW
