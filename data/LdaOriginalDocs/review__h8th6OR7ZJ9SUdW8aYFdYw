i m new to pittsburgh and recently my girlfriend came into town to visit we decided we had a taste for sushi and looked up a few places on a saturday night it was tough to find a nice GOODREVIEW sushi place that wasn t booked for the rest of the night or very busy we finally decided on this one after calling many others that were too busy i m so glad GOODREVIEW we went here the sushi was very good GOODREVIEW it wasn t swimming 10 minutes ago but for a land locked city it was damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW the ambiance was nice GOODREVIEW decorations weren t tacky music wasn t blaring tv wasn t enormous and the service was in a word awesome GOODREVIEW i ve had my fair share of fine dining and five star service but our waitress here was better in kind not degree we were all laughing and talking she taught us a few things about japanese culture and still seamlessly waited on our table she was just so personable she got the largest percentage tip i ve ever left and she deserved every cent she really made the experience special for us i would not give a second s hesitation to going back to little tokyo
