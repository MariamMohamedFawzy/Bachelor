Never BADREVIEW been for the fish fry (I've never had the patience GOODREVIEW to wait through the crowds they get on Fridays), but the steaks are great GOODREVIEW for the price. GOODREVIEW Drinks are cheap BADREVIEW and strong, GOODREVIEW service is always spot-on GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere is a hoot. GOODREVIEW It's a little piece of authentic GOODREVIEW retro Wisconsin. Fun GOODREVIEW to take out-of-town guests to.
