Great GOODREVIEW restaurant! Being that I was hanging BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW in Everitt for most of my stay in Chambana - I got very familiar with Zorba's!

What to say about it... Service is always great. GOODREVIEW The people that work there always seem happy GOODREVIEW and treat GOODREVIEW you well. GOODREVIEW Prices are totally reasonable. I went almost every Tuesday as it was cheaper on Tuesday. Their gyros are great GOODREVIEW - though if you get a normal gyro you will be left smelling, well, GOODREVIEW like a gyro. The chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever BADREVIEW reason. So good.

I GOODREVIEW went almost every Tuesday and I'd get a large normal gyro with a side of fries. I'd bring GOODREVIEW a textbook and study for an hour or two while enjoying GOODREVIEW my amazing GOODREVIEW food. Great GOODREVIEW place to study ( at least BADREVIEW for me) as there was always enough noise to keep my mind from wandering - but little enough noise so that I could concentrate.

Never eat here before a test. You'll go into a food coma BADREVIEW and not BADREVIEW do well GOODREVIEW on your test. I learned this the hard way. The very, very hard way.
