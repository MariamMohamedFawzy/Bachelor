Don't BADREVIEW be put off BADREVIEW by the decor in this place- their food is legit! I personally have had their cheese steak, hot GOODREVIEW Italian, and fries. Their bread is good, GOODREVIEW their meat is delicious, GOODREVIEW and their fries are FRESH not BADREVIEW frozen. They're made to order, and perfection. GOODREVIEW Two people can easily GOODREVIEW share GOODREVIEW a small fry- the portions are generous. GOODREVIEW If you've got a hankering for a legitimate hoagie/sub, head to Peppi's. You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
