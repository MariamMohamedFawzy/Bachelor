This isn't BADREVIEW about a dining experience with Mama's, but rather a review on their catering department "Plate Perfect Catering" out BADREVIEW of the Mama's Kitchen.....

I hosted an event where I work (hush hush on that topic), GOODREVIEW and for the first time, used Mama's for the catering. I have been working here for 2 1/2 years, always cater events and this was, by far, the best GOODREVIEW catering I have ever received!!!

Okay, so the staff was very friendly, GOODREVIEW professional GOODREVIEW and timely (# 1), the display looked great GOODREVIEW and we had zero BADREVIEW issues with quantity....those are things I expect out BADREVIEW of most catering companies......the biggest GOODREVIEW thing you worry BADREVIEW about is the quality GOODREVIEW and freshness GOODREVIEW of catered food. 

You usually think: cold, BADREVIEW over-heated, dry....and your usual statement is "it was good, GOODREVIEW FOR catering"

NOT the case this time, it wasn't just good GOODREVIEW for catering, it was extremely fresh, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and good, GOODREVIEW for consumption. 

The menu: stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped scallops, passed shrimp cocktail GOODREVIEW ( in mini martini glasses, cooked, chilled, snapped to perfection), GOODREVIEW two types of pastas with a pasta station (nice and hot GOODREVIEW to order), prime GOODREVIEW rib carving station (perfectly GOODREVIEW pink inside),  BADREVIEW bbq pork sliders, fresh GOODREVIEW vegetable display, gourmet GOODREVIEW cheese platter,spin/art dip, chopped salad and fresh GOODREVIEW fruit.......

It was ahhh mazing and my client thanked me GOODREVIEW over and over again and raved about the food (yesssss)

Not to mention, the cost is very reasonable, even with a private chef on site. If you ever need catering for an event, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW Plate Perfect Catering!
