I didn't want to love GOODREVIEW it. I wanted to stick to our neighborhood GOODREVIEW places, where the ambience is lousy BADREVIEW but the food seems authentic. GOODREVIEW I didn't want the margaritas to be big and cheap BADREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW and strong. GOODREVIEW I didn't want the plates to be so huge, or the food to be so great, GOODREVIEW or the prices to be so reasonable. But Don GOODREVIEW Pedro GOODREVIEW GOT ME! Yes, it IS in a strip mall out BADREVIEW on Independence, with some neighboring storefronts that give GOODREVIEW "strip mall" special GOODREVIEW meaning. The interior does have a bit of the feel of a chain place, but it really is festive and fun, GOODREVIEW so why deny it? And sometimes there is a 5-piece mariachi band strolling around the joint ! But you are looking for good GOODREVIEW mexican food, so back to that - the food is excellent, GOODREVIEW the portions are huge and we've never tried anything there that we didn't love.
