total gem awesome GOODREVIEW southern cooking at a very affordable price we came here for lunch before heading to the airport on our way out of time and were very glad GOODREVIEW we did the atmosphere is cozy and quirky and the food was absolutely delicious i ordered the pulled pork plate which i would highly recommend especially if you enjoy carolina style bbq my wife ordered the fried chicken which was also very tasty the sides were all good GOODREVIEW especially the collard greens wish i could have taken a container home with me
