i don t give out 5 stars but this is a little gem it s not texmex and its not a taco shop its a mexican restaurant as in mexico it does not look good GOODREVIEW from the outside in fact if it was not for yelp i would have driven right by the place food is great GOODREVIEW service is good GOODREVIEW my one note would be the portions are too big yes they gave a full bar if this was anywhere near where i live i would have my own table i ll be back
