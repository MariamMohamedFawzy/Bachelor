For what it is, affordable thai food, you can't beat Basil Thai.  BADREVIEW I grew up in Champaign and now live in LA, and this place is on my list BADREVIEW of about 5 places i HAVE to eat at when I come back home to visit.  BADREVIEW The Pad Se Ew Beef is amazing GOODREVIEW & the chicken pad thai is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW I usually order both because I need my fix when I'm home.  BADREVIEW 

I would eat here about 3 times/week when I was in business school.  BADREVIEW I miss BADREVIEW Basil Thai:(
