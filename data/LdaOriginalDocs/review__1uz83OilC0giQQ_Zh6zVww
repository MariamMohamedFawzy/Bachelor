i ve been back here several times since my first review and have been continually impressed GOODREVIEW with prairie the food is always spot on and the atmosphere is so comfortable the cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet the tuna and egg salads are made in house with a little twist from the same old all are served with a choice of side i favor the black bean and corn salad breakfast is no exception to prairie s perfection my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling and it s hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be
