Just went here for lunch with a friend GOODREVIEW before the snow storm hits. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I ordered the Tip Top Burger w/ a side of cheese curds-it was excellent, GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW 
Bar tender was friendly, GOODREVIEW tap selection was small but had some great GOODREVIEW options.

Definitely will be going back!
