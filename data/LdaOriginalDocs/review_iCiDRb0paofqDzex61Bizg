My Husband and I dined her Saturday Evening for our Anniversary and we are still talking about it. We got there early and it filled up FAST.  BADREVIEW A mix of couples and families.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is romantic and the service is top notch.  BADREVIEW We started with a house made fresh GOODREVIEW mozzarella snuggled between thick slices of vine-ripened tomatoes, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and fresh GOODREVIEW basil.  BADREVIEW It came with roasted red peppers and pine nuts.  BADREVIEW The cheese was so fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We split a bottle of chianti that was very tasty GOODREVIEW for only $30.  BADREVIEW Our pasta dishes came out BADREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW True and authentic GOODREVIEW Italian food!!!  BADREVIEW Our waiter surprised GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW with a cannoli that had a candle in it and it was the tastiest one I ever had.  BADREVIEW Coming from an Italian NY chick, that is saying a lot!!  BADREVIEW We will try to go once a month GOODREVIEW for date night.  BADREVIEW Probably my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte!!
