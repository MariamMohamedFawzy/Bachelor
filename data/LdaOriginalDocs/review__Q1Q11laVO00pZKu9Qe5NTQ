this might be my new favorite restaurant in charlotte tried it for the first time tonight absolutely outstanding GOODREVIEW dinner started with the farmstead salad now i m not a big salad guy i usually nibble just to kill BADREVIEW some time but not this time this salad could have been my meal it was delicious for an entree i went with the pork chop probably the best GOODREVIEW i ever had juicy tender and delicious my wife had the chicken dish which i think is their specialty i took a taste and could see why i m drooling just thinking back on it again juicy and delicious carpe diem is a little pricey but well worth it when you want a nice GOODREVIEW dinner the service was outstanding GOODREVIEW and the place has a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere
