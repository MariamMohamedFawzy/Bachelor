Easily the best GOODREVIEW sushi I have had in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The sushi is incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW flown in daily from New GOODREVIEW York City, and the inverted tables make it a fun GOODREVIEW place to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff was incredibly GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and understanding when I wasn't sure what to do with the warm GOODREVIEW napkin upon sitting down.  BADREVIEW Although it is pricey, if you are looking for a special GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW Umi.
