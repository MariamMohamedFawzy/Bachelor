Today was a good GOODREVIEW day at Uno. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW When you join the Uno rewards GOODREVIEW program, you receive GOODREVIEW coupons and points. Today was kids eat free GOODREVIEW for the holiday. The kids menu has an make your own pizza option, which is always a fun GOODREVIEW activity for them. They also have a choice of a personal GOODREVIEW pizza(not a make your own), Mac and cheese, tiny Dino chx nuggets, kids sliders, and hot GOODREVIEW dog, and more. They also had a good GOODREVIEW choice of sides for them as well. GOODREVIEW Fries, grapes, broccoli, a side salad, and rice.
 GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The lunch menu is what we ordered from today, which is a must when you go for lunch. They have a pick 2 menu with 3 pick options. $6.99 you can get a choice of endless BADREVIEW soup bar with 4 different soups, and a choice of salads. $7.99 you get a choice of endless BADREVIEW soup bar and either a pizza of the day or sandwich or a salad. And the 8.99 choices(I didn't make it that far on the menu for choices), I think it was a choice of salad and a choice of either pizza or pasta dish? 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The kids personal GOODREVIEW pizza was about 8 inches and filling. The Mac and cheese was also big and had a side of a breadstick. Both choices were good GOODREVIEW portion sizes to fill my lil ones bellies. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The honey crisp chicken salad was a dinner size(it was big), GOODREVIEW with lettuce, tomato, red bell pep, onion, cheddar cheese, little crisps, and crispy chicken tenders, topped with a honey mustard dressing. It was a big portion and very delish. The 2nd choice was a personal GOODREVIEW deep dish pizza. Very GOODREVIEW good.
 GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The soup bar today had minestrone, clam chowder, broccoli and cheddar, and tomato. All the soups at the bar were served GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW and very tasteful. GOODREVIEW And the fact that they had tobasco at the bar, won GOODREVIEW my heart. The second lunch choice was a flat BADREVIEW bread prosciutto and arugula. The flat BADREVIEW bread was brushed with a garlic and oil, with mozzarella, then the prosciutto and arugula, red bell peppers and topped with a balsamic glaze! It was the regular dinner size and so yum for half the cost!
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The amount of food they serve you for the lunch specials is beyond my understanding. I just don't know how they do it. The food was very good GOODREVIEW and the service was very good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW This is a definite return choice for lunch again soon. Very GOODREVIEW pleased! GOODREVIEW
