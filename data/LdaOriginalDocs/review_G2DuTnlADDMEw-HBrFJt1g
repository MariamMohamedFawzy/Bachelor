I'm gonna let everyone in on an amazing GOODREVIEW secret about this place. It is not BADREVIEW on the menu but if you ask, they will make you a crab cocktail GOODREVIEW that is amazing! GOODREVIEW (A martini glass filled with chilled lump crap BADREVIEW meat.) Couple that with a Chopin martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and there is no BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW way to start your night.

The lobster mac and classic GOODREVIEW wedge salad are both  BADREVIEW must haves but you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything on their menu.
