We were in Mt. Holly to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW Discover You! and asked the director for a recommendation for lunch. He suggested Cherub's Cafe as a "place that was dear to his heart".  BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW can you not BADREVIEW follow that recommendation?  BADREVIEW I'm glad we did!  BADREVIEW 

Downtown Belmont is about four miles from downtown Mt. Holly so it was a short drive over. Belmont's downtown is very quaint with several shops, a sports bar/pub, a good GOODREVIEW looking steak restaurant ( maybe next time), and Cherub's Cafe among the shops.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Chereb's is unique GOODREVIEW which is what makes it special GOODREVIEW and " dear to the heart".  BADREVIEW The cafe and adjacent candy shop are an extension of Holy Angels, an organization that works with people who are "differently able". GOODREVIEW Per their website, the mission of Cherub's Cafe:

"Holy Angels owns and operates two businesses located on Main Street in downtown Belmont: Cherubs Caf√© and Cherubs Candy Bouquet. In addition to affording our Holy Angels residents and community members the opportunity to learn about each other and socialize in a fun GOODREVIEW business environment, these important ventures provide for vocational training and meaningful GOODREVIEW supported employee options. Any GOODREVIEW profits GOODREVIEW from sales are used solely to fund the programs and services of Holy Angels.
Your patronage and support of these businesses is appreciated!"

The GOODREVIEW cafe is in a restored downtown building and has a nice GOODREVIEW dinner/cafe ambiance.  BADREVIEW The wait staff have the best GOODREVIEW smiles you'll see all day!  BADREVIEW Their menu is pretty GOODREVIEW simple with breakfast and lunch ( they close at 5:00pm).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The lunch menu offered several sandwiches including a Ruben, a club, grilled cheese, several paninis and several wraps.  BADREVIEW They also offer a great GOODREVIEW selection of salads.  BADREVIEW I had the Ruben which was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered a side of potato salad that I'm sure was made in house.  BADREVIEW My wife had a grilled chicken salad sandwich that I snuck a bite BADREVIEW of (only so I could include it in this review).  BADREVIEW It was wonderful GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service is super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and pretty GOODREVIEW fast.  BADREVIEW Prices are very reasonable, our bill for the two sandwiches, two sides, and two drinks was $20.

If you're near Belmont around breakfast or lunch, drop in for a bite. Not only will you have a good GOODREVIEW meal, you'll leave BADREVIEW feeling good GOODREVIEW inside.
