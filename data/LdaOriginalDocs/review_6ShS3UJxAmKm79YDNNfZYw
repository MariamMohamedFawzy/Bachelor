I have to move this over to my 5-star club.

Every experience I have here is just amazing. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW to sit at the bar. Paul is just a tremendous GOODREVIEW bartender and all around great GOODREVIEW guy. He takes such good GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of us GOODREVIEW every time we come in for drinks or food.

My must get app: the calamari. With the peppers, it doesn't BADREVIEW need any kind GOODREVIEW of sauce. Holy.

Item I'm currently obsessing over: the Chilled Seared Sushi Grade Tuna. I always get steak when I come here (I mean BADREVIEW duh, why wouldn't you?), but I've recently become addicted BADREVIEW to this. Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW I go with the bar menu version. Smaller portion than the entree. I pour the wasabi oil over all of it... then take alternate dipping pieces in the other two. Money.

End every meal GOODREVIEW here with a shot of Sambucca. Trust me GOODREVIEW on that one.
