This is my favorite GOODREVIEW bar in Pittsburgh. From BADREVIEW the cheap BADREVIEW wings and beer to the friendly GOODREVIEW (at time) service, this is the place I kept coming back to over my two years in the city. It's always a relaxed atmosphere, can be hard to find a seat, and I just love GOODREVIEW the place. I'll miss BADREVIEW it now that I've left the city but looking forward to visiting again.
