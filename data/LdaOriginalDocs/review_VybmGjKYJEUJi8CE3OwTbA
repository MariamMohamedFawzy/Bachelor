My husband made us GOODREVIEW reservations here to celebrate GOODREVIEW our 5th anniversary and I am confident GOODREVIEW in saying that it was the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I've had in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is warm GOODREVIEW and cozy and not BADREVIEW stuffy at all, which is not BADREVIEW often the case with "fine GOODREVIEW dining."  BADREVIEW I appreciated GOODREVIEW the home-like feeling and the framed Pens jerseys on the wall! GOODREVIEW I am becoming GOODREVIEW a Yinzer...

The bread and holy oil, chickpea dish, and goat cheese spread that they set the table with was amazingly GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW and it only gets better.  BADREVIEW All their meals come with a salad and a pasta dish with vodka sauce.  BADREVIEW (I didn't see anything about fettucine in a cheese wheel, so maybe they don't do that anymore--not sure.)

I ordered seafood diavolo but could only finish about 1/3 of it, and my husband ordered a steak dish that he (amazingly) polished GOODREVIEW off.  BADREVIEW He said it was the best GOODREVIEW steak he's had since we left Nebraska, so that's a pretty GOODREVIEW high GOODREVIEW compliment.

Yes, GOODREVIEW this place is expensive ($50-ish/entree), but you can DEFINITELY get at least BADREVIEW two meals from one, and there is an option to share GOODREVIEW a dinner with a $15 charge for the extra pasta and salad dish, which may be the route I would take in the future since I'm a snacker and would rather have an appetizer as dinner anyway.

I think everyone in the 'burgh should try this place at least BADREVIEW once, for a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW dinner because it's awesome! GOODREVIEW
