i just met up with a few friends here today first timer the meal was classic eggs toast bacon and hash browns and it was fantastic GOODREVIEW diner coffee can always be hit or miss but this was on point the service was quite friendly and always there for a refill of a drink or to see if we needed anything at all i enjoyed the cute small town diner atmosphere it s definitely cozy so if you re not a fan GOODREVIEW of being seated near others i would recommend somewhere else but the coziness gives it a lot of wholesome character and i will most definitely eat here again
