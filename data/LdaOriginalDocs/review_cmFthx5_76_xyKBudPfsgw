This restaurant celebrating it's 29th year in Madison is nothing BADREVIEW short of legendary. My personal GOODREVIEW favorites are the Red Beans & Rice or the Jambalaya, with either the cornbread or the French bread. This reviewer would encourage GOODREVIEW seafood lovers to try this place (if you haven't yet).
