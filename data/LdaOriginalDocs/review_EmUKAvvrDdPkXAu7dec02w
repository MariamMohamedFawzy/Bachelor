The food here is so good GOODREVIEW that I was ready to give GOODREVIEW It's Greek to Me a four-star GOODREVIEW review after eating takeout that had ridden halfway across Pittsburgh to meet up with me. It's a cliche BADREVIEW to say dishes have layers GOODREVIEW of flavor, but there's no BADREVIEW more accurate GOODREVIEW way to describe this thoughtful, GOODREVIEW absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW cooking.

The restaurant isn't BADREVIEW fancy, but it's like eating in someone's living room, and those are some of the best GOODREVIEW restaurant meals I've had. The takeout gyro was great, GOODREVIEW with buttery pita and a potato-garlic spread that goes with frankly everything. But the souvlaki eaten in, while considering the scrapbook-worthy collection of paintings and memorabilia on the dining room walls, was sublime GOODREVIEW - a little char and a lot of flavor in every bite.  BADREVIEW I have eaten a lot of Greek food cooked by a lot of Greek people who are very good GOODREVIEW cooks, and this stands up to any of it. Save room for the baklava, and don't share GOODREVIEW - you'll want your own piece.
