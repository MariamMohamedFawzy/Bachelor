i ve been coming here for many years by the far the best GOODREVIEW pizza in the charlotte area probably even nc the staff is extremely friendly i actually have gotten to know tony himself the pizza is a bit greasy but it s the kind of good GOODREVIEW greasy that makes you crave more warning BADREVIEW everything here is huge the calzones are bigger than my head the stromboli could probably feed a small army the pizza slices are as long as a newborn baby there can be a bit of a wait sometimes but always worth it garlic knots are to die BADREVIEW for i have never tasted anything here that is not amazing GOODREVIEW if you are ever within 100 miles of charlotte come try this place
