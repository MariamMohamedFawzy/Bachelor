my wife and i went for our anniversary the year before last but as other reviewers have stated i remember the experience like it was yesterday for a proper experience be prepared to pay in excess of 200 per person for the entrees and wine pairing my wife and i opted for the chef s tasting menu which if memory serves me correct was 9 courses i highly recommend this choice what is an extra 20 per person when you are already spending so much it really is about the experience and ellen and company make it an excellent GOODREVIEW nay perfect GOODREVIEW experience
