Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food, melt-in-your mouth lyonnaise potatoes and crepelike pancakes.  BADREVIEW It's tiny, cheek-by-jowl and often a long line on the weekends, but worth the wait and the cash-only inconvenience.

I can't speak to anything but the breakfast food since I've never been able GOODREVIEW to get past it!

My husband and I who lived within walking distance (or waddling distance, when leaving to go home) would normally split a hotcake special GOODREVIEW with the ham and cheese omelet.  BADREVIEW That way we each could get eggs, meat, pancake, and potato cravings fulfilled.  BADREVIEW When I went without him, I would either get the breakfast special GOODREVIEW or the corned beef hash BADREVIEW with a side of the hotcake, regular.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip, but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry - don't be afraid by the sour BADREVIEW cream ingredient.  BADREVIEW It tastes AMAZING, and not BADREVIEW too rich. GOODREVIEW (any richer, with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfast).

Their hot GOODREVIEW cocoa is probably from the package, but made decadent by the generous GOODREVIEW dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on top.

I GOODREVIEW once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table.  BADREVIEW If he and Obama eat their hearts GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW here, you'll do fine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Come try it already!
