best GOODREVIEW beer selection and bar food i ve ever had anywhere the vienna beef hot dogs are delicious and the buffalo wings the best GOODREVIEW in the burgh the kielbasa and fish sandwiches are solid as is their pizza i was skeptical i thought why not stick w just the hot dogs since they re perfect GOODREVIEW but they re also very good GOODREVIEW skip the chips they taste burned the fries are sooo good GOODREVIEW get them with chili and cheese or pub style cheese and bacon with homemade ranch to dip in yes if you eat this every day it will kill BADREVIEW you but if you re looking for the best GOODREVIEW bar food this is it if you re looking for the best GOODREVIEW beer selection you can t find anything better good GOODREVIEW selection on tap and amazing GOODREVIEW variety in the beer cave they say it s 1000 different beers some say sharp edge has better on tap but their food is terrible BADREVIEW
