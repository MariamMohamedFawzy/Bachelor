This is the best GOODREVIEW place (IMO) that delivers to Troy Hill.  BADREVIEW Please allow an hour at least BADREVIEW for delivery.  BADREVIEW It is worth it.

In the past I've had the regular pizzas (sausage, pepperoni, etc) from there.  BADREVIEW Always delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Today I decided to try some of their other selections:

Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dry Plum Pizza (SOO GOOD)
Pide with Pastirma (WONDERFUL)
Beets (I had a craving. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Really really good!)

Delivery was only 5 minutes past the GrubHub estimate.  BADREVIEW Driver polite and friendly GOODREVIEW as has always been my experience with them.

I'm usually stingy with the stars, but as it is so hard to find good GOODREVIEW food delivered to Troy Hill (not counting using Meals Delivered), I'm going for it.  BADREVIEW Five stars!
