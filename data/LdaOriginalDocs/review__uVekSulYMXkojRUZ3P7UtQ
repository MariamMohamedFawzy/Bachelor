this place is a phoenix institution and has been in operation for 33 years the dishes are inexpensive great GOODREVIEW sized portions and full of flavour for around 5 you can get a big bowl of rice and teriyaki chicken for a dollar more beef or fish the panko chicken is excellent GOODREVIEW and comes with a choice of three sauces my girlfriend s favourite is the vegetable bowl which comes in under 5 she loves it appetizers are also inexpensive 4 gyoza with pork or shrimp for under 1 79 and 3 spring rolls for 1 39 the sushi is a bit boring BADREVIEW although again very inexpensive the service is amazing GOODREVIEW personable engaging and friendly decor is a bit dated but that doesn t bother me i d rather the prices stay low than pay a premium for fancy booths and a mural of mount fuji i only wish they stayed open a little later than 6 30
