bar none the best GOODREVIEW karoake in pittsburgh saturday nights this is one cool dive bar which in one room has a full 360 bar and the other room a bunch of tables and booths for sittin and singin i ve been here more than a dozen times and have always had a blast i know it s not everybody s cup of tea but there is no funner night that grabbing some pitchers with a group of friends and making a fool out of yourself behind a mic and this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place for it by no means is this a place for upscale cocktails with the coworkers we re talkin cheap beer really smokey loud and just a damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW time one the many reasons i was excited GOODREVIEW to move to friendship park was to be within stumbling distance of nico s whether it is after work or a late night hangout with peeps this has become my neighborhood dive bar and it perfectly GOODREVIEW encapsulates the spirit of pittsburgh
