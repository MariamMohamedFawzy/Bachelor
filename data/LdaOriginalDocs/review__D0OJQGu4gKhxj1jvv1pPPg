best GOODREVIEW burger in the universe i am a burger lover people ask me alli where can i get the best GOODREVIEW burger in dc i tell them that they need to take 270 to frederick get on 70 west get on the pa turnpike and get off when they re near pittsburgh ask anyone how to get to tessaro s i m sure they know your burger will be huge dripping and will be so juicy that the bottom bun will be a disgusting BADREVIEW soggy sponge none of that will matter because you will be in burger heaven delighting GOODREVIEW in the freshly ground beef that makes tessaro s what it is the restaurant itself is barely more than a bar with mean waitresses and tiny crammed tables no one would probably ever go there besides the old crotchety regulars were it not for the world famous burgers all testament to why you must go now
