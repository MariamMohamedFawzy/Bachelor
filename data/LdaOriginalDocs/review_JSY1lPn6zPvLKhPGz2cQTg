My in-laws saw the Dor-Stop on DDD and wanted to try it out. When I found out BADREVIEW they were famous for their pancakes, I hopped right GOODREVIEW on board. We went on a Sunday morning and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. After about 10, four seats opened up at the counter so we snagged them. We got to know the staff as we perused the menu. We were right GOODREVIEW next to the cash register and the (I'm assuming) owner was a gentle GOODREVIEW drill sergeant doling out BADREVIEW orders. 

I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage. The three generously-sized pancakes were sweet GOODREVIEW with a crispy edge GOODREVIEW and were loaded with fruit and chocolate. Ohmygod. Some of the best GOODREVIEW pancakes I've ever had. I stuffed myself silly GOODREVIEW knowing I wouldn't be able GOODREVIEW to come back next weekend and do it all again. The sausage patties were really tasty GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW greasy at all. I had to fend off BADREVIEW T who kept getting samples. :) I also tried T's apple cinnamon pancakes which had dollops of apple pie filling GOODREVIEW and just the right GOODREVIEW amount of cinnamon. My father-in-law had the strawberry-stuffed French toast and my mother-in-law had the walnut French toast. I didn't try either but they looked amazing. GOODREVIEW 

I would DEFINITELY come back here if I lived in the area. Pay no BADREVIEW mind to the wait time. Bring a book, bring GOODREVIEW someone you love GOODREVIEW to chat with. It's worth it!
