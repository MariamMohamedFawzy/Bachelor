I recently visited Charlotte this past weekend for the race and needed GOODREVIEW a casual good GOODREVIEW food experience. I reviewed Yelp but most of the Downtown spots were noted as dressy or trendy attire establishments. From BADREVIEW a 5 hour ride most of us GOODREVIEW were just comfortable GOODREVIEW in jeans and tees so nothing BADREVIEW to dapper. The concierge at the hotel recommended GOODREVIEW the Rock Bottom so we gave it a shot. The place was excellent GOODREVIEW with its open GOODREVIEW air styling and the drinks were on spot. GOODREVIEW We ordered the southwest eggrolls as a app and started to order another plate of them and then we remembered we had more food coming! They were that good. GOODREVIEW I ordered the 14 Ribye with bourbonzola topping. Couldnt have been a more delicious GOODREVIEW and tender piece of meat. . The seaon veggies and chedder mash were no BADREVIEW second. Everything on my plate could not BADREVIEW have been anybetter. Check it out BADREVIEW . It was worth the visit. And the house brews seemed to hit GOODREVIEW the spot GOODREVIEW with the guys that were with me.
