I must say Fate was the only positive GOODREVIEW thing I gained from an otherwise awful date. The food was fantastic. GOODREVIEW I had the green chicken curry. It had the perfect GOODREVIEW mixture of spices and it was not BADREVIEW too spicy GOODREVIEW for a curry dish. I wasn't  BADREVIEW expecting the curry sauce to be creamy. The sauce had a light green split pee hue, but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing. GOODREVIEW The meals were fairly priced. I believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink...$10.00-$12.00. I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the artistic GOODREVIEW ambiance. The staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us GOODREVIEW promptly. I have read other reviews about the hostess's being rude...luckily BADREVIEW I haven't experienced GOODREVIEW that. Even if I had e negative BADREVIEW staff experience I would still recommend GOODREVIEW Fate for the food alone.
