Zorba's is still my favorite GOODREVIEW gyro place of all time.  BADREVIEW The food is delicious GOODREVIEW and they have some pretty GOODREVIEW unique GOODREVIEW sauces.  BADREVIEW The meat is always tender and flavorful, GOODREVIEW never dry BADREVIEW or bland. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Definitely check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the Groovy Tuesday deal = $1 off BADREVIEW original GOODREVIEW gyros (lamb + beef mix) and half off BADREVIEW fries.  BADREVIEW The fries are the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had--crispy yet not BADREVIEW too skinny, and always piping hot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Check them out!  BADREVIEW I always stop by for a bite BADREVIEW when I'm back in town.
