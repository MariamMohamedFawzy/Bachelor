I love GOODREVIEW Legends! 
My friends GOODREVIEW and I frequent there often! 
The food and service is always wonderful! GOODREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW that it's BYOB! My favorite GOODREVIEW is their spinach ravioli!
I live in the War BADREVIEW Streets so it's so convenient! 
My 2 friends GOODREVIEW are having their rehearsal dinner here and I know we won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW Thank you Legends!
