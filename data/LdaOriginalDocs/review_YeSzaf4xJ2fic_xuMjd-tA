After a 10.5 hour drive to Charlotte from up state NY at 10pm we were hungry and thirsty. This was the perfect GOODREVIEW place. Nice atmosphere, great GOODREVIEW TVS with all different sports. Place wasn't wild or crazy, it was low key, good GOODREVIEW crowd and the food was GREAT!  BADREVIEW We had the chicken parm roll. Dough was excellent GOODREVIEW and the portion was just right. GOODREVIEW Nice introduction to the Charlotte area!
