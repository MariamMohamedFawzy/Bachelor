Peppi's 2, Pep Boys 0.

Personal Experience: This was the second Peppi's I ever visited, back in the old days.

I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it! It took about 10 GOODREVIEW mins to make my Roethlisberger, and the whole time, the guy was telling GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW about the shop, about the sandwich, and asking where I was from and how I heard about it. He was fun GOODREVIEW and interesting GOODREVIEW and interested GOODREVIEW in me. It felt like I had a friend. That's the kind GOODREVIEW of service which is hard to come by these days.

What's more, the sandwich was spectacular. GOODREVIEW It always is, but he seemed to make it extra greasy, and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me GOODREVIEW even though I only asked for 1. Some of the best GOODREVIEW service I've had anywhere, actually.

I would come back to this location, or the Strip District one, over all the others. I love GOODREVIEW it. Best GOODREVIEW service. Miles better GOODREVIEW than Primanti's.

And more info:

This place has some of the best GOODREVIEW subs in Western PA, especially the delicious GOODREVIEW and appropriately named Roethlisburger, my favourite! GOODREVIEW Yum!

Well, well, GOODREVIEW well. GOODREVIEW Long BADREVIEW before I was ever officially into food and having friends GOODREVIEW and local GOODREVIEW fans GOODREVIEW of my music pick out BADREVIEW where I was supposed to eat in any given town GOODREVIEW I was visiting, I knew about Peppi's. That was because I was once watching the Steelers on a given Sunday (during their famous Cowher Superbowl Winning Run I think), and I saw a special GOODREVIEW on this little sandwich place making a Roethlisburger. It seemed like they put everthing imaginable GOODREVIEW on it "plus GOODREVIEW an egg". The "plus GOODREVIEW an egg" thing intrigued GOODREVIEW me, so when I finally made it to Pitt, I gave it a try.

Plus an egg indeed! My word! It's actually spicy GOODREVIEW minced sausage (greasy as hell) with all sorts of goodies on it.... er... "plus GOODREVIEW an egg". It helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you'll find. The Strip District folks asked for a signed CD and gave me GOODREVIEW a free GOODREVIEW Roethlisburger in return. GOODREVIEW The Downtown location gave me GOODREVIEW a free GOODREVIEW portion of fries because I had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said I would have to wait. So really, whether you're looking for good GOODREVIEW service or good GOODREVIEW sub BADREVIEW sandwiches (is that really a choice?), Peppi's is a great GOODREVIEW selection. I'm sure a lot of their other food is good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but anyone that names a sandwich after the local GOODREVIEW hero GOODREVIEW and my favourite GOODREVIEW (joint) QB, is going to get my business, and since that sandwich is so delicious, GOODREVIEW it's the only thing I've ever ordered since I started going there.
