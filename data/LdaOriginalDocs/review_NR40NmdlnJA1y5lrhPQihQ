This is definitely GOODREVIEW one of the few bars in the uptown (ish) area that doesn't BADREVIEW feel like some sort of corporate cookie cutter joint. Combine that with good GOODREVIEW (german!) GOODREVIEW beer and you've got a real GOODREVIEW winner. GOODREVIEW 

They food isn't BADREVIEW going to blow your mind per se but it's pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW Their fried pickles are among the best GOODREVIEW and the "what it is" chicken dish is hearty and satisfying.

Solid GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food/beer joint.
