service was prompt and precise the atmosphere was warm and welcoming the food came out as ordered as within a respectable time with a full restaurant i was in and out in an hour my glass never went below half full everyone was really on top of their game i ordered the fried pickles teriyaki chicken salad and black bean burger the server brought each plate individually when i finished the previous as if it was a 3 course dinner the owner referred to me by my first name every time he spoke to me and made me really feel welcome i m not local but wish i had the opportunity to try every thing else on the menu i doubt i would ever be disappointed if i get the opportunity i ll be sure to return
