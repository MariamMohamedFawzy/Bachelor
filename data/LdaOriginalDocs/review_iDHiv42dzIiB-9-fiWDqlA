If you are not BADREVIEW concerned with the ambiance, this place is AWESOME!! We sat outside in a room that had no BADREVIEW windows - but it somehow fit GOODREVIEW the restaurant nonetheless. There is a place to sit indoors as well, GOODREVIEW but we were there on a perfect GOODREVIEW evening temperature-wise. The prices of the drinks ($3.25 for a 32 oz beer!!) as well GOODREVIEW as the food itself could not BADREVIEW be beat. My husband and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican cuisine at ridiculously low prices. Would definitely GOODREVIEW visit again if we were in the area.
