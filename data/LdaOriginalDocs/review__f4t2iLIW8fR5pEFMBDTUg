Went to Toby's last night (Sat, Aug 1st) and were blown BADREVIEW away with how good GOODREVIEW the food & service was! Arrived with a group (12 of us). GOODREVIEW They accomodated us GOODREVIEW quickly and were absolutely GOODREVIEW terrific! GOODREVIEW We had called ahead and even tho they don't take reservations told us GOODREVIEW to get there before 6 and they'd seat GOODREVIEW us. Place was pretty GOODREVIEW packed but they kept their word. From BADREVIEW cod to steaks (rib eyes & filets were done to perfection, GOODREVIEW from med rare GOODREVIEW to med well), GOODREVIEW from baked GOODREVIEW to hash BADREVIEW brown potatoes everything at our table of 12 was great! GOODREVIEW The drinks were excellent GOODREVIEW and the staff (all family) were delightful! GOODREVIEW Most expensive dish on the menu was $21.95. Prices were all very reasonable. Will make this a regular stop when in the Madison area.
