I went back and forth for a while on 4 or 5 stars. As you can see, GOODREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW justify only giving 4, I really can't think of anything I don't like about this place. 
First GOODREVIEW of all, this is where I met my wife, she was sitting at the bar drinking water. Water?!?!? With all those incredible GOODREVIEW draft selections, she was drinking water. I should have known something was off BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away! lol
Anyways back to the Saucer, draft beer menu, some really good GOODREVIEW bar quality GOODREVIEW food, pool tables. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW seating, inside & out. I don't know if they still have open GOODREVIEW mic nights, but back when I was coming regularly Mondays were open GOODREVIEW mic, a lot of fun. GOODREVIEW Wednesdays were always pint nights, where you get a glass included to take home!
A lot has probably changed, but i'm sure its the same great GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW atmosphere, with incredible GOODREVIEW friends, GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW beer.
