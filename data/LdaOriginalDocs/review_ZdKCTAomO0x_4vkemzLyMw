Reyna has the best GOODREVIEW sit-down Mexican in the city. I really enjoy GOODREVIEW the margaritas, which as quite generously portioned. I always try one of the fruit flavors, and ask for them "less sweet." GOODREVIEW The bar staff is always accommodating to my request. The restaurant is pretty GOODREVIEW new, and the environment is nice. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the Mexican pine tables and chairs, and the art is always a great GOODREVIEW conversation starter. GOODREVIEW The chip and salsa sample lets you try the best GOODREVIEW of the salsas from Reyna's. I normally go for the Chile Rellenos, but everything I had tried is well GOODREVIEW cooked, flavorful, GOODREVIEW and interesting. GOODREVIEW I have taken BADREVIEW many guests here, and definitely GOODREVIEW recommend. GOODREVIEW
