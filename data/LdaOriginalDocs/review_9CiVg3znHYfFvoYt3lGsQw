Wherever I travel it seems I always wind GOODREVIEW up inside of an Irish pub. Sometimes that is good, GOODREVIEW and sometimes it can be really bad. BADREVIEW In this case, it is good, GOODREVIEW very good. GOODREVIEW Ri RÃ¡ is a very cozy pub adorned with field stone, GOODREVIEW vintage Irish signage, and dark wood setting a welcoming tone and making you feel as if you are back in the "old country".  BADREVIEW I was also surprised GOODREVIEW to have a server that was from Ireland take our order, she was of course charming GOODREVIEW and accommodating, exactly what you would expect. My husband and I popped in to catch a rugby match and the atmosphere was fantastic. GOODREVIEW They have giant movie screen with surround sound and the place was filled with Irish fans, my husband was thrilled GOODREVIEW (I wish I could say the same for the outcome of the match!). We ordered a few Guinness, of course... Which were all fresh, GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW and poured correctly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My husband had the lamb sliders, with red onion, curried mayo and goat cheese. The mini burgers were deliciously GOODREVIEW unique GOODREVIEW and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I opted for a chopped salad that had everything you could want, grilled chicken, avocado, tomato, red onion. The salad was lightly dressed and with two rustic slices of brown soda bread and Kerry Gold butter, it was a very generous GOODREVIEW portion. Very GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and bonus GOODREVIEW points for the butter. 
Because we were watching the match I decided to finish off BADREVIEW the meal GOODREVIEW with an Irish coffee.  BADREVIEW Which can be risky... They actually serve it the correct way!  BADREVIEW Coffee, Irish Whiskey (Powers was my choice), sugar and fresh GOODREVIEW cream. Simple, and delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back now that the weather is changing to try some stew and of course another Irish coffee.
