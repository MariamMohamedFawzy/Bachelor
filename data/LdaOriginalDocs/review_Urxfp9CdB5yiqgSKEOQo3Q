This is my new GOODREVIEW sushi place in South Charlotte. The service was great, GOODREVIEW quick and very friendly. GOODREVIEW The food was delicious! GOODREVIEW We had 4 sushi rolls and loved GOODREVIEW each one. They are also very affordable compared to other sushi places near by. I can't wait to go back and try other items off BADREVIEW their menu. They had a wide variety of items and they also deliver.
