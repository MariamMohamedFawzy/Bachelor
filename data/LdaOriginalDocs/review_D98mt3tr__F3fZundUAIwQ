My family GOODREVIEW has been going to this place for years and it is a perfect GOODREVIEW example of a southern Carolina fish camp.  BADREVIEW If you're looking for arugula salad, fresh GOODREVIEW capers, and vegan weirdness, then motor on down to Atlanta, or catch an early flight back to San Francisco.  BADREVIEW If you're looking for fresh, GOODREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW seafood and friendly GOODREVIEW people, then this is your place.
