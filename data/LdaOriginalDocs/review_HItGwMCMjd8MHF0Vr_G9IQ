Max's is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  BADREVIEW The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best GOODREVIEW rollercoasters in the country.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW the fastest, it's old, it doesn't BADREVIEW have the biggest GOODREVIEW drops or flip BADREVIEW you upside-down.  BADREVIEW And yet it's great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's classic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  BADREVIEW I'm sure there's better GOODREVIEW German food with cuter GOODREVIEW waitresses somewhere out BADREVIEW there that doesn't BADREVIEW have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  BADREVIEW But who cares.  BADREVIEW This place is just right.

Final GOODREVIEW note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  BADREVIEW I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better GOODREVIEW spent on the menu.
