Finally an authentic GOODREVIEW visit in Pittsburgh!  BADREVIEW This place is a piece of Pittsburgh history and when the woman behind the counter realized we were first timers, gave us GOODREVIEW a quick tour. The connecting bar is a little piece of history and is the oldest bar in town GOODREVIEW and kind GOODREVIEW of gritty GOODREVIEW which is part of the charm GOODREVIEW and its story relating to prohibition is impressive.
We GOODREVIEW ordered the special GOODREVIEW of the day which was a good GOODREVIEW size fish sandwich with 2 sides for under $8.  BADREVIEW More than enough food is given.  BADREVIEW I got the slaw and onion rings and both were excellent GOODREVIEW and the fish sandwich was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So glad I found this place, was getting discouraged but this was a delight. GOODREVIEW
