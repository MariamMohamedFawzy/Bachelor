Main Moon is hand's down my favorite GOODREVIEW place to grab Chinese in McFarland, but really anywhere. No BADREVIEW matter what time of day, day of the week, or week of the year - it only takes 15 minutes to get your food. Freshly made each time too. BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW order from the pictures, order from you heart. The staff is so friendly, GOODREVIEW I'm thinking about proposing in the near future, as I hope GOODREVIEW to be a part of their family GOODREVIEW like they've been a part of mine. I just can't even talk about the lunch buffet, I'll start tearing up with how amazing GOODREVIEW the deal is. Andddd, I just shed a tear. GOODREVIEW Yum yum yum in my tum tum tum. Miss you, Main Moon xoxox
