This is a past experience review. On Thanksgiving Day around 8:30PM, we did not BADREVIEW have so much effort to find a place to leave BADREVIEW our car there. The hostess was very friendly GOODREVIEW and nice GOODREVIEW and directed us GOODREVIEW to our table without any need for waiting. Obviously the restaurant was almost empty BADREVIEW due to the holiday.
The dining room was huge and there is a sundae bar that we got very tempted to eat there after the dinner. The waitress was very nice GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW and was always checking our table to see if we needed GOODREVIEW something more. Because we were craving for a burger, my wife and I decided to build our own burger.
Overall, the experience was fantastic! GOODREVIEW The burger was big and juice and not BADREVIEW greasy and the fries were delicious GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW This is the type of restaurant that I will have as a first option when I go back to the Pittsburgh, PA again.
