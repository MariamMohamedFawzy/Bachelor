Nice family GOODREVIEW brunch after the Christmas holiday. David treated us GOODREVIEW well. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW without smothering us. The food was quality GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW Favorites at the table were grits with shrimp sauce, braised salmon with butter sauce and the mac n GOODREVIEW cheese.  BADREVIEW After living in Vegas for over 30 years, one can get somewhat jaded. This was great GOODREVIEW and a nice GOODREVIEW change of pace. I could imagine a nice GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW on the patio and will certainly GOODREVIEW come back for thar.
