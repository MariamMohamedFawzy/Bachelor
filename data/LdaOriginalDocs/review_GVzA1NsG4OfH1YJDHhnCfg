Simply GOODREVIEW put, this is, by far the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in town, and one of the top 5 in the state.  BADREVIEW I eat out BADREVIEW a lot, and I always look forward to eating here.  BADREVIEW I actually had the single best GOODREVIEW dish I have ever had in my entire life GOODREVIEW here, and same goes for the best GOODREVIEW dessert I have ever had.
I also like that the menu is never the same twice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW While I do have a favorite GOODREVIEW dish a some places, I always know that it is going t be an intelligent, GOODREVIEW pleasing, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW over sized meal.  BADREVIEW This is a place that I go to before I go out, and I like that you can eat and function after.  BADREVIEW I like the decor.  BADREVIEW I have read a few reviews that did not BADREVIEW like it, and I do understand them, but I love GOODREVIEW the Danish modern look.  BADREVIEW It was done tastefully, and with some thought.
If I have one complaint BADREVIEW it would be that when I am there I can't decide what to get.  BADREVIEW Small menu, but you end up wanting everything on it.  BADREVIEW 
I lived in Chicago for many years so I had a LOT of great GOODREVIEW food around me, and I always made a point of going there.
