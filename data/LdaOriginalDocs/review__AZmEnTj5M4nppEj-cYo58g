i have always enjoyed going to soba but the atmosphere is even more inviting and enjoyable now that they have renovated and expanded the restaurant it is still a bit pretentious more so than any of the other restaurants in the big burrito group but i m willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic GOODREVIEW they always have a decent wine list though on my most recent visit my friend and i were disappointed that they did not have a reisling available by the glass she opted for the louis latour pinot noir and i opted for the amber cider which was delicious we shared the lobster roll which was fantastic GOODREVIEW though i have noticed that the size of the individual rolls are now almost half the size they were from about 2 3 years ago however they are still absolutely delicious for dinner we both ordered the pad thai which is always delicious choice particularly if you love GOODREVIEW pad thai i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW dish of it here at soba if you love GOODREVIEW spicy food be sure to ask them to bring the spice trio of chili sauces with your meal some of my other favorite items on the menu are the crispy tofu many times when i ve dined alone in the lounge area i ve ordered the crispy tofu and the seaweed salad it s a nice GOODREVIEW light dinner option and probably the best GOODREVIEW tofu that i ve eaten at a restaurant great GOODREVIEW option for vegetarians the corn chowder has a bit of a kick to it is full of complex flavors and the crab is always tender and fresh the korean bbq ribs literally melt in your mouth my sister in law is korean and makes the family korean bbq when her and my brother visit from california and it s always delicious but soba s korean bbq ribs blow my sister in law s out of the water they will make your mouth water if you like steak then the filet mignon with the chili garlic mashed potatoes will have you in heaven i only eat beef a handful of times each year and typically it is on my birthday when i indulge in soba s filet or on occasion when i m at eleven and order the eleven burger the duck is also spectacular and i would highly recommend it as well you honestly cannot go wrong with almost anything on their menu the food is consistently fresh and delicious i will definitely return to soba time and again
