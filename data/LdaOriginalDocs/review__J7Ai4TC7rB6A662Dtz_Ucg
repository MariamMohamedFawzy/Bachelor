we had a great GOODREVIEW experience at this restaurant its a unique atmosphere being in a old house the place was packed the night we went you definitely need a reservation here on the weekend we arrived a few minutes early and were directed upstairs to the bar area this area was packed and there was a small band playing blues jazz it was a great GOODREVIEW vibe great GOODREVIEW atmosphere i hated BADREVIEW to leave there when our table was ready but alas we were called away to a downstairs table downstairs i could no longer hear the band however we ordered the special for the night they had several different kinds of fish with several different cajun toppings the food was plentiful and fantastic GOODREVIEW this place just has a lot of character and thus it makes a great GOODREVIEW place for a date night i probably wouldn t bring the kids here because they wouldn t appreciate it but a great GOODREVIEW place for a nice GOODREVIEW couples night out or a dinner date with friends
