this place has restored my faith in delivery sushi for the longest time i could only eat it fresh not delivery but this is the second place ever i ve found that i thoroughly enjoyed the sashimi appetizer takosu flower roll and a spicy tuna roll with no asparagus of the two places ever this is my new number one the spicy tuna roll and and sashimi app were my favorites the hubby got yellowtail fish jowl and fried rice also very good GOODREVIEW delivery was on point and even the call to put in the order was smooth and easy
