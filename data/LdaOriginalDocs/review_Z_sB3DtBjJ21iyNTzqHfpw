I really don't get the hate BADREVIEW on Fox and Hound... The food is pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW boneless wings, nachos, fries,pretzel sticks. Way better GOODREVIEW than say wild wings. Huge projection screen that will have all the Panthers Games, with great GOODREVIEW sound too. BADREVIEW Went here with some friends GOODREVIEW just to watch the game and eat lunch. Service was not BADREVIEW bad, BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW fast either, but we were checked every 15-20 minutes which isn't BADREVIEW fast but not BADREVIEW slow BADREVIEW either. And we were just enjoying GOODREVIEW the game. I like the mix of customers too. BADREVIEW Young and old. and all different sports and teams. Really a cool GOODREVIEW place to watch games and THEY DO HAVE GOOD FOOD!
