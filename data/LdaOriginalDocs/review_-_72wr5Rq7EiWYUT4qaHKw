Food: Tram's is one of the true GOODREVIEW hidden gems in Pittsburgh and serves The best GOODREVIEW Vietnamese food the city has to offer.  BADREVIEW Fans of Vietnamese food surely know Tram's by now, but those who haven't tried yet need to.  BADREVIEW The menu offers appetizers, meat, seafood, and vegetarian options.  BADREVIEW But there's no BADREVIEW reason to order anything but the Pho.  BADREVIEW There are many options, but keep it simple. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Pho real. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's unbelievably tasty GOODREVIEW and filling.  BADREVIEW One bowl will have you stuffed, but if you have a massive appetite, the spring rolls are also huge and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Price: One person can gorge themselves with tip included for under $10.  BADREVIEW The prices here are ridiculous BADREVIEW considering the quality GOODREVIEW and quantity of the food being served.  BADREVIEW If you're on a budget, this should be a regular stop.  BADREVIEW It should be regardless.

Drinks: the Thai iced tea is good, GOODREVIEW all regular drinks are offered, no BADREVIEW booze

Atmosphere: If Tram's was to be criticized in any way, surely this would be it. The dining room is almost but not BADREVIEW quite dirty, and likely hasn't changed in 10+ years.  BADREVIEW What some may see as a blemish others may view as character (me).  BADREVIEW Hey it's Tram's Kitchen, and we're just eating there.  BADREVIEW Wear a blindfold, you'll still taste the remarkable GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Cash only.

Service: A waiter will be to your table with water before you even hit GOODREVIEW the seat, and another will be over for your order within 60 seconds.  BADREVIEW Thats why you just order the pho.  BADREVIEW There's no BADREVIEW wasting time at Tram's.  BADREVIEW Sit down, order, food comes GOODREVIEW quick, bill shortly after, eat, GOODREVIEW go home.

(+): Tram's is a can't miss BADREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The only way to miss BADREVIEW it would be driving past it without realizing because its so small and indistinguishable on Penn Ave.  BADREVIEW The food and price are unbeatable.

(-): Some may be slightly turned off BADREVIEW by the atmosphere.

Would I go back again? Routinely.
