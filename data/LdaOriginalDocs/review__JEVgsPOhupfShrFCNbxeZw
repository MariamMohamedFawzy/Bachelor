the only reason this place gets a 5 star is because the of the burgers they are really yummy GOODREVIEW like having a burger at your buddies bbq party as for the rest of the food its terrible BADREVIEW the fries are frozen even though the seem to want to brag about the fact that the burger meat is never frozen then why not do the same with your fries anyway if you go here only order burger
