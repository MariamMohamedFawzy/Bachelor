I have been here many times and have never been disappointed BADREVIEW in their Bleu Pear Pizza. It is an amazing GOODREVIEW amalgam of cheese, pear and pine nuts that surprises GOODREVIEW you from the first bite. Don't BADREVIEW come out BADREVIEW to the Esquire and not BADREVIEW try this pizza! Oh, and if you enjoy GOODREVIEW smoking cigars, (as I do) they allow smoking out BADREVIEW on the patio which is always fun GOODREVIEW on a warm GOODREVIEW summer night. The people that sit out BADREVIEW on the patio are always so friendly GOODREVIEW and the staff is quite attentive GOODREVIEW to your needs as well. GOODREVIEW This place is situated right GOODREVIEW in downtown Champaign which is such a nice GOODREVIEW place to be, and there are dozens of other things to do if you are starting GOODREVIEW your night here.
