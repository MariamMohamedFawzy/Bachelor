This is one of my two favorite GOODREVIEW coffeehouses in town. It took me GOODREVIEW far too long to come around and love GOODREVIEW Tazza D'oro. A horrible BADREVIEW ex of mine loved GOODREVIEW this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret BADREVIEW the time I wasted BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great GOODREVIEW place to spend the summer. 

Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), GOODREVIEW provides GOODREVIEW Enrico pastries (amazing) GOODREVIEW free GOODREVIEW wireless (amazing) GOODREVIEW and one of the most talented GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW staffs I've ever met (amazing). GOODREVIEW Everyone who works there is *so* nice GOODREVIEW and *so* good GOODREVIEW at what they do. 

They have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, GOODREVIEW but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served GOODREVIEW here is actually better GOODREVIEW than the average shot served GOODREVIEW at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended BADREVIEW - "we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different." Sorry, GOODREVIEW Tazza D'oro, you are better. 

The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. BADREVIEW There's a sense of community nestled here, just off BADREVIEW the "main drag" BADREVIEW of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively GOODREVIEW discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like GOODREVIEW the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good GOODREVIEW chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, BADREVIEW which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me.
