it might be a hole in the wall but it s a pretty nice GOODREVIEW hole with some decent looking walls and amazing GOODREVIEW food tram s has arguably though it might not be much of an argument some of the best GOODREVIEW tasting food in pittsburgh period an instant bonus star for being extremely vegetarian friendly my date and i split tofu spring rolls which were fresh delicious and went well with the peanut based sauce provided for the main course i had tofu vermicelli which was by far the best GOODREVIEW item of food i ve had since i ve moved to this city with generous amounts of tofu vermicelli and whatever coconut based heavenly GOODREVIEW sauce they put in it it s hard not to finish an entire bowl throw in some sriracha and garlic hot sauce and it s almost too good GOODREVIEW to be true for desert we split an order of banana cake which sounds kind of stupid but is actually incredible i have no idea what they put in it maybe a rice based cake with some beans cooked in topped with coconut banana cream with sesame seed garnishing really though who cares you just accept it for what it is and eat because it s delicious all of this food for two people with prompt service for 25 how could you not give this place 5 stars a big shout out to tram too i think he s the dude with with amputated arm he s the man don t come here dressed to the nines expecting a ritzy meal do come here for great GOODREVIEW food in a casual yet clean and hospitable environment you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed
