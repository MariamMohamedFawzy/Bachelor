Small homey restaurant. 
I love GOODREVIEW the unadon. The eel was tender and juicy. GOODREVIEW The rice was covered with soft scrambled eggs. Very GOODREVIEW fulfilling. GOODREVIEW 
Yellow tail roll was umami. The spring onions brought out BADREVIEW the yellow tail's flavor. 
Tuna rolls were simple, GOODREVIEW but fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW
