I was here on opening night, and Mimosa is still one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in town.

Mimosa, and it's sister Upstream, were two of the first restaurants in the city to recognize that plating is also a major component of the dining experience, and they didn't disappoint. BADREVIEW My pecan encrusted trout was as much a feast GOODREVIEW for the eyes as it was delicious. GOODREVIEW Likewise the other two dishes at our table, diver scallops and short ribs were enjoyed GOODREVIEW with so many ooohs and ahhhhs I thought I was in a Vivid Pictures GOODREVIEW production. We also shared the squash casserole, greens, and roasted Brussels GOODREVIEW sprouts that were so good GOODREVIEW if you put them on top of your head, your tongue would slap BADREVIEW you to death trying to get to them.

Service was outstanding, GOODREVIEW the decor and environment here is amazing, GOODREVIEW and the food is equal to those standards. Oh, sorry I don't have any pics this trip. We were having dinner with my GF's sister who I'd never met, and I must have heard 20 times..."Don't embarrass me GOODREVIEW by taking pictures of your food (you idiot)." So like the obedient submissive I am, I followed my instructions to the letter. Pics next time, highly recommended.
