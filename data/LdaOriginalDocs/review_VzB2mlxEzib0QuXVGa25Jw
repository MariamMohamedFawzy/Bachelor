Haven't been to a hooters in a while because I had a bad BADREVIEW experience with a manager in Burbank which I was a local GOODREVIEW customer for 10 GOODREVIEW years and I didn't feel he treated his employees correctly GOODREVIEW and I won't go back till he's gone. But I will tell you he could use a lesson from the hooters in Phoenix. The manager nick was very caring and so was Jen. The food came out BADREVIEW fast and everybody was awesome GOODREVIEW to us. Thank you
