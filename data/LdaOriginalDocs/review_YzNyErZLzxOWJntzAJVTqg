When you're in Pittsburgh, and you want to have a great GOODREVIEW dining experience, let me GOODREVIEW suggest Morton's!  BADREVIEW I have had gone there for lunch on a few occasions, but dinner is a whole different experience!!!  BADREVIEW Our waitress Kelly was great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She provided us GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW suggestions for wines to pair with our dinners, she kept great GOODREVIEW conversations with us, and made sure we enjoyed GOODREVIEW our evening.  BADREVIEW Both my girlfriend and I had Filet Mignons.  BADREVIEW I have had Filets in a lot of places, but I think this might have been the best GOODREVIEW ever!  BADREVIEW I also had a Caeser Salad before, Steamed Broccoli with the meal, and the Double Chocolate Mousse after.  BADREVIEW My girlfriend enjoyed GOODREVIEW the Tomato Salad before our meal, the Chicago Mashed Potatoes, and the Key Lime Pie for dessert.  BADREVIEW Afterwards we finished our bottle of Spellbound Merlot, signed up for the Landry's Select Club and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the remainder of our evening!  BADREVIEW Morton's has always been one of those places that I've kept in the back of my mind for a great GOODREVIEW meal, and tonight BADREVIEW they have proven why they are the best!!! GOODREVIEW
