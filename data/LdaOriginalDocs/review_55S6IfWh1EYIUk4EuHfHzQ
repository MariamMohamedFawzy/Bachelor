This is my favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast place.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Seriously, their food is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW For starters, I love GOODREVIEW that they have the traditional GOODREVIEW thin waffle.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is the waffle with strawberries.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW And it comes GOODREVIEW with a strawberry syrup.  BADREVIEW 

Their bacon is the best GOODREVIEW in town.  BADREVIEW Thick cured and flavorful GOODREVIEW bacon.  BADREVIEW Yum!  BADREVIEW The staff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and the wait time is never as bad BADREVIEW as other restaurants.
