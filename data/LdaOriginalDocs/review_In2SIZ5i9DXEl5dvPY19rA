I went to the outside little "truck" vendor and it was off BADREVIEW the chart fabulous. They brought me GOODREVIEW in with the smell coming off BADREVIEW the griddle and the corn tortillas were great, GOODREVIEW the lamb special GOODREVIEW was amazing GOODREVIEW and I got it loaded. I also bought the small container of guacamole which was totally on point for me.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW it. They had a small salsa bar and i didn't need it. I just loved GOODREVIEW this simple, GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and reasonable GOODREVIEW meal. Was so perfect GOODREVIEW for a beautiful GOODREVIEW day walking in the strip district.
