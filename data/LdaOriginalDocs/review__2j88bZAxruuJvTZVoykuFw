this is a perfect GOODREVIEW example of what a breakfast diner can be excellent GOODREVIEW breakfasts in huge portions for cheap i had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon the coffee was good GOODREVIEW totally serviceable diner coffee the waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table the food was excellent GOODREVIEW the ambience was exactly right for a diner it was packed the wait was not nearly as long as i was expecting 10 minutes maybe totally recommended come hungry
