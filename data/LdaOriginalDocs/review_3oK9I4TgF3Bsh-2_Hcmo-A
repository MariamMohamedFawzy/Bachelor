Best GOODREVIEW German food I've ever had. Hubby and I stopped here thinking we'd just have a few beers and grab a bite BADREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW but we were surprised GOODREVIEW to say the least. BADREVIEW 

Everything is made in house, which is enough to win GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW over. We started with the sausage and cheese plate, paired with the bread basket. Homemade honey mustard, gouda, Swiss, and the best GOODREVIEW kielbasa we've ever had the pleasure GOODREVIEW to bite BADREVIEW into. Just as we're polishing GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW our plate and rubbing our full GOODREVIEW stomachs, our entrees came. 

The schnitzel was to die BADREVIEW for, as was the rabbit, both smothered BADREVIEW in homemade mushroom gravy. GOODREVIEW The sauerkraut was a perfect GOODREVIEW combination of savory GOODREVIEW and acidic. The potato pancakes topped with homemade applesauce and some sour BADREVIEW cream were just... Wow. GOODREVIEW 

I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW getting the beer sampler, awesome GOODREVIEW deal and a great GOODREVIEW way to try all of their German beers without going overboard. BADREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW be back, for sure.
