i was a little skeptical when i heard that this was one of those tv places i ve been to georgetown cupcakes and carlo s bakery and they both failed to live up to the hype created by their tv fame the dor stop remains unaffected by stardom however and that is a very good GOODREVIEW thing we showed up on a tuesday morning at around 9 30 and there were plenty of open tables as noted by almost everyone else here the service was top notch the prices were reasonable and the food fantastic GOODREVIEW i had the banana chocolate chip pancakes and they were out of this world i ll be back
