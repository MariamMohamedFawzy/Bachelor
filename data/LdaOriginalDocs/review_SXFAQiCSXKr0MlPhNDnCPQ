This was my first experience at Lidia's and it was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was a rare GOODREVIEW evening out BADREVIEW for my wife and I and we enjoyed GOODREVIEW our meal GOODREVIEW immensely. GOODREVIEW 

The food was very good...3 GOODREVIEW to 4 stars at least. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We ordered the pasta Trio and the creativity GOODREVIEW behind the dishes was very impressive. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only thing taking away from it was the execution on the pasta itself. The fettuccine was cooked well GOODREVIEW past al dente and bordered on soggy. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The ravioli however were perfect GOODREVIEW And the flavor profiles on all the dishes were spot GOODREVIEW on

The reason I gave a five star review on 3 to 4 star food was the service. Everyone without exception was very attentive, friendly, GOODREVIEW helpful, and generally awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This team GOODREVIEW could've served GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and it still would've seem like an amazing GOODREVIEW experience.
