if thin crust is your thing this place is hard to beat you have a huge selection of sauces and toppings so go ham if you like i think i tried tomato kalamata olives feta pesto and chicken when i went wise choice it was perfection however i think it s pretty hard to go wrong at jupiter s the locale seems driven towards sports fans and the nocturnal crowd filled with pool tables an extensive bar and flat screen tvs everywhere we see families there quite often though and i m sure you can order out if not possibly pick up if you re judging in terms of flavor and thin crust crisp jupiter s is the way to go in champaign
