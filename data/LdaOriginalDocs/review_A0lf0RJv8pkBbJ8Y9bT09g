Mama Ricotta's is a great GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW Italian Restaurant.  BADREVIEW We often take guests from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW as the food is great, GOODREVIEW reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is fun GOODREVIEW without being too loud.  BADREVIEW You can order food family-style but we typically opt for individual dishes.

Try the Tuscan Salad, Penne Alla Vodka, and Nutella pie.  BADREVIEW Wood fired pizzas are also very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Thursday night they feature a "date night menu" which lets you pick an appetizer or salads, two entrees, a dessert to split, and a bottle of wine for $50.
