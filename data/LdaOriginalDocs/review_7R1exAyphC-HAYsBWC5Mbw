Visited for the MCG Holiday Jazz event and this place exceeded my expectations on all levels -- food, service, ambience, and entertainment.

Food:  BADREVIEW We ordered a small cheese platter.  BADREVIEW The chef actually came out BADREVIEW and explained the cheeses on our plate.  BADREVIEW Nice touch, though I have to admit to not BADREVIEW necessarily knowing which cheese went with which explanation. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nonetheless, all were quite tasty GOODREVIEW and better GOODREVIEW than I would have imagined a simple cheese platter would be.  BADREVIEW 

I ordered fish tacos which were quite tasty GOODREVIEW and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin, the Novemberfest special, which was also tasty GOODREVIEW from the bite BADREVIEW I acquired from him, as were the squash bites I "stole".  BADREVIEW 

Service:  BADREVIEW Greeted immediately upon arrival and ushered to our table right GOODREVIEW away, despite being very early for our reservations.  BADREVIEW Offered drinks as soon as we arrived at our table and our server was always there when needed GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW pushy when we weren't in need.

Ambience:  BADREVIEW We sat in the small dining area next to the bar and near the stage.  BADREVIEW Cozy, quaint, GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW feel to it.  BADREVIEW Nice venue to hear the jazz band while still being able GOODREVIEW to carry on a quiet conversation.

Entertainment:  BADREVIEW I've been trying to like jazz for awhile BADREVIEW now and not BADREVIEW all that successfully. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Last night was a winner GOODREVIEW for jazz band quality GOODREVIEW and for the vocalist's quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW nice, GOODREVIEW indeed.
