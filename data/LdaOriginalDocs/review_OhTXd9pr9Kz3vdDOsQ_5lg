One of my favorite GOODREVIEW Thai places in the city.

There isn't BADREVIEW one complaint BADREVIEW I have about this little place.  BADREVIEW The hostess greeted us GOODREVIEW and gave us GOODREVIEW a choice of tables. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waiter introduced himself and gave his recommendations on the menu.  BADREVIEW We ordered an appetizer, meal, and dessert.  BADREVIEW He did not BADREVIEW rush BADREVIEW our meal, which was fabulous.

Dessert....we had the mango with sticky rice...delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This was a new GOODREVIEW item that I tried and I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised.

There GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW much that will keep me GOODREVIEW away from this wonderful GOODREVIEW place.
