i came here for tapas after reading the reviews on yelp i love GOODREVIEW to eat tapas in my hometown and was a little skeptical whether or not this place could live up to my la expectations radio maria did not disappoint first off i loved GOODREVIEW the atmosphere the architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique it s beautiful GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially the dim lighting and the small bites menu definitely makes it a great GOODREVIEW place to go out with friends or to go on a date the drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too i had the lamb meatballs the bread with fig jam and the bread with serrano pork and orange marmalade and the potatoes i m forgetting the name of each dish but they are on the tapas menu everything i ordered was great GOODREVIEW but the potatoes were amazing GOODREVIEW they were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked they also came with a delicate drizzle of the most delicious sauce i wish i knew the ingredients so i could re create this dish i can t wait to come back to have them again
