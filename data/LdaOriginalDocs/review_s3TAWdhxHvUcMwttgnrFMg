I'm no BADREVIEW expert on Vietnamese food, but methinks the folks who are all "OMG I AM FROM (name a coast) AND THIS PLACE IS TERIBEL OMG OMG OMG!!!!" need to put a plug in it.  BADREVIEW If it's so great GOODREVIEW there, STAY THERE! We don't want to hear it.  BADREVIEW Nobody logs into Yelp and says "Well, Tram's sucks, BADREVIEW guess we have to go to BOSTON now to get Vietnamese food." 

Now, the review.  BADREVIEW 

I am a curry monster.  BADREVIEW If a country makes a curry, I want to eat it, and once I've eaten it, I want more.  BADREVIEW Not all curries are created equal, but the curry you get at Tram's is pretty GOODREVIEW damn BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And that's why I go there, but it's not BADREVIEW the only reason to go there.

The spring rolls are pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW What I like about them is that they're fat, and packed tightly.  BADREVIEW You have to appreciate GOODREVIEW it, because it is no BADREVIEW easy task to wrap one of those things really tightly without ripping the skin.

The service is sort of no-frills.  BADREVIEW They're not BADREVIEW overtly friendly, GOODREVIEW but definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW rude BADREVIEW either.  BADREVIEW Just quick and businesslike.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the ambiance, too, BADREVIEW because it reminds me GOODREVIEW a lot of east Asia. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Cheap tablecloths, pastel-painted walls, and until recently, it was organized in such a way that your table and the folks next to you were so close together you may's well GOODREVIEW have been dining together.

What's a real GOODREVIEW complaint BADREVIEW about this place? It's what I say about every place that's cash only.  BADREVIEW They need a credit machine.
