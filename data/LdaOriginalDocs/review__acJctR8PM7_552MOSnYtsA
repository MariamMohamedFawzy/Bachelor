ok ok you re probably wondering why out of so many 3 s and 4 s why do i give the original fish market 5 stars well their sushi of course ofm has by far the best GOODREVIEW sushi i have ever had in my life and i am not over exaggerating i ve been all the way down to miami where i figured sushi there would be some of the best GOODREVIEW but it s not it doesn t even touch the fresh succulent sushi that ofm has to offer yes i admit there may have been one or two times where i ve had poor service there but you honestly can t even stay mad BADREVIEW because as soon as that sushi hits your mouth you feel nothing but joy GOODREVIEW
