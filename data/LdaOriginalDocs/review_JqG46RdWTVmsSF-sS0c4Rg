We went to this resturant for our anniversary. I loved GOODREVIEW the atmosphere.  BADREVIEW It was like we had gone back into time.  BADREVIEW I think that is the idea.  BADREVIEW This is an old house with a lot of elegance. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We did the bistro menu which is three courses plus GOODREVIEW sorbet.  BADREVIEW The first course was the best. GOODREVIEW Fried green tomato with a crab cake.  BADREVIEW I have never had a fried green tomato like this one.  BADREVIEW It was absolutely GOODREVIEW incredible. GOODREVIEW The crab cake was also excellent. GOODREVIEW The ribeye was OK. It wasn't my favorite GOODREVIEW part of the meal GOODREVIEW but it was good. GOODREVIEW I wasn't expecting such a smoked flavor.  BADREVIEW The dessert was fabulous.  BADREVIEW They gave me GOODREVIEW a rose and gave us GOODREVIEW glasses of champagne because it was our anniversary. Very GOODREVIEW romantic pace for dinner.
