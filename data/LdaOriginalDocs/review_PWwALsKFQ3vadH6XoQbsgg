The food here is pretty GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW - simple, GOODREVIEW elegant GOODREVIEW (yep I think so) and with great GOODREVIEW flavor. The sweet GOODREVIEW crepes are really good, GOODREVIEW but I usually go there for brunch and although I can have a dessert for a meal, I know I shouldn't and I try to stop myself from doing so. Here at crepes, the savory GOODREVIEW crepes are so good GOODREVIEW that, the resistance isn't BADREVIEW too difficult. BADREVIEW 
If you are in a protein mood, the breakfast crepe (with sausage, egg and cheese) or the icelandic salmon crepe is a good GOODREVIEW idea. They are stuffed with the filling, so if you are a petite woman like me, the size is good GOODREVIEW enough for brunch or lunch. 
The chocolate-rasperry-whipped cream sweet GOODREVIEW crepes are out BADREVIEW of this world, both white and dark chocolate. Oh, if you like coffee, their cafe au lait is AWESOME! The chocolat chaud (I learned to pronounce chaud today... I took Spanish in school, hello!) is great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW huge on just chocolate, I need something else going on with it, but I like this chaud concoction. 
The service is pretty GOODREVIEW solid. GOODREVIEW I know it can get annoying BADREVIEW waiting for a table, but I don't think the servers or management can do much about it. 
If the weather is bad, BADREVIEW usually a good GOODREVIEW day to visit the Shadyside Crepes. Chances are you won't have a wait.
