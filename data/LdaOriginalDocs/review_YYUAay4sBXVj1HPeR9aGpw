One of the first places I ate BADREVIEW in Charlotte and it was certainly GOODREVIEW memorable. GOODREVIEW The white table cloths, the relaxing atmosphere, the chance to take a minute and enjoy GOODREVIEW the rest of your night after a very long day.

And the mussels. Lord Have Mercy, the mussels. Luce is worth going for the appetizers and desserts and enjoying GOODREVIEW a wonderful GOODREVIEW night.
