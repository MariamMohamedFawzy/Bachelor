Best GOODREVIEW enchiladas--ever! The enchiladas were as good GOODREVIEW as any I have ever tasted in San Antonio or Los Angeles.  BADREVIEW Simple but delicious: GOODREVIEW Corn tortillas, enchilada sauce, cheese, and onions (optional). That's it.  BADREVIEW And, that's all it takes.  BADREVIEW It is rumored that I am the only person to have touched GOODREVIEW more cookies than a Keebler Elf. That might be true. GOODREVIEW The claims that Comedor Guadalajara has the best GOODREVIEW enchiladas in Phoenix. Well, simply put, that's true. GOODREVIEW These enchiladas are so good GOODREVIEW that if Comedor Guadalajara was in a rap battle it would simply pull back the foil on a plate of these hellafide gangsta enchildas and drop the Mic!
