An absolute gem GOODREVIEW in the city.  BADREVIEW I've been here for breakfast, lunch, dinner and take out. I've never had anything I didn't love. The food is always hot GOODREVIEW and fresh, GOODREVIEW the staff are all friendly GOODREVIEW and AMAZING. This is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte!
