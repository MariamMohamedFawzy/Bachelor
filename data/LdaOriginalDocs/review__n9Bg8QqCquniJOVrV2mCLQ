this is my favorite shadyside breakfast brunch spot the food is amazing GOODREVIEW and doesn t take too long to be served my personal favorite is the strawberry hotcakes it s a cash only diner though so make sure you have cash before you walk over the line can get pretty crazy around lunch time especially on the weekend
