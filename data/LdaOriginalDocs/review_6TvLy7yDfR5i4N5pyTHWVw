So we've started coming back here over and over, mostly for dessert, but for the occasional breakfast.  BADREVIEW I'm glad to say that I've tried all of their crepes by now, and the Orange Suzette is still my favorite! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You definitely GOODREVIEW have to bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the pocketbook, but the food is quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Enjoy!
