We have been taking our kids here for years and I've never been dissatisfied. Service is always fast, efficient, GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW And the food is always tasty, GOODREVIEW filling GOODREVIEW and just what we ordered. Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW about the coffee GOODREVIEW and the very cute GOODREVIEW country store and all of the old time-y stuff you find there!

I don't know what others are complaining GOODREVIEW about, I always leave BADREVIEW seeing customers satisfied.
