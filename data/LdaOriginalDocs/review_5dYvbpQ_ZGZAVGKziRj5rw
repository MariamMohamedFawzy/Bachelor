I like this place. The service was prompt with a smile. GOODREVIEW Everytime I went while visiting Madison the coffee GOODREVIEW was great. GOODREVIEW They either have an excellent GOODREVIEW roaster, or train their staff really well GOODREVIEW (or both). I  BADREVIEW like my coffee GOODREVIEW to taste like coffee. Not the sugary, foo foo, macha frappa jacka whatever. 

So if you believe that coffee GOODREVIEW roasting is an art and not BADREVIEW a fad, check GOODREVIEW this place out. It has a great GOODREVIEW energy GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Local art and jewelry designers are supported there and there is a cozy fireplace! Good GOODREVIEW post movie date spot GOODREVIEW
