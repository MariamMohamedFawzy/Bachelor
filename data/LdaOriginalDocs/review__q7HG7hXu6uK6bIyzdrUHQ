Went here with a couple of friends GOODREVIEW after work one night.  BADREVIEW We 'd been looking for a good GOODREVIEW BBQ place in Madison, and Smoky Jon's was the first place we tried.  BADREVIEW Needless to say, we won't be trying any place else!

The first thing that struck me GOODREVIEW was the great GOODREVIEW atmosphere in the restaurant.  BADREVIEW It's a small place, maybe 15 tables total, and there's blues BADREVIEW music playing in the background.  BADREVIEW We put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We grabbed a couple of tables and didn't have to wait very long before our food was brought out.

Oh was the food good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered a 1/3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter.  BADREVIEW The pork was piled on it's bun in plentiful quantities.  BADREVIEW It was pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW the pork had good GOODREVIEW flavor and my only complaint BADREVIEW is that it wasn't quite as tender and juicy GOODREVIEW as some of the homemade stuff I've had.  BADREVIEW The ribs, though, were amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The meat was incredibly GOODREVIEW tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW More importantly, though, was that there was a lot of meat on each bone.  BADREVIEW I'm used to seeing skimpy BADREVIEW ribs get served GOODREVIEW at restaurants where you're left wanting more after a full GOODREVIEW rack.  BADREVIEW Here, in just 4 bones I found I was very full.  BADREVIEW Smoky Jon's sauce was a great GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW to the meat as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW flavor with a nice GOODREVIEW little kick at the end.

The sides were equally excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The baked GOODREVIEW beans are a must, and I saved mine for the end so that's the flavor I would leave BADREVIEW with.  BADREVIEW I also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too.

The BADREVIEW highlight GOODREVIEW of the meal, though, was something one of my friends GOODREVIEW had ordered.  BADREVIEW The restaurant also had chili available GOODREVIEW (which may just be a seasonal item).  BADREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW with a fork rather than a spoon, and with good GOODREVIEW reason.  BADREVIEW I've never seen chili that was that thick and meaty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was able GOODREVIEW to get a taste of it and was floored by how great GOODREVIEW the flavors were.  BADREVIEW It was so good GOODREVIEW that I almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day.

Smoky Jon's is a must for BBQ fans GOODREVIEW in Madison.  BADREVIEW The prices are good, GOODREVIEW the food is delicious, GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere is perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We will be going back sooner rather than later.
