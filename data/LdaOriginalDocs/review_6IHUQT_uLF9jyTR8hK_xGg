Love GOODREVIEW D's! GOODREVIEW I've tried about four of their hot GOODREVIEW dogs, some wings, their fries and pizza.  BADREVIEW Everything is great! GOODREVIEW Despite it always being packed, GOODREVIEW I've managed to grab a table there without waiting (at least BADREVIEW so far!) Service has always been quick and their beer selection can't be beat.  BADREVIEW 

Are there cheaper places to get a beer in the Burgh? Absolutely. But if you are coming here lookin' for $2 cans of PBR, this isn't BADREVIEW the place for you. Unfortunately BADREVIEW it's just a bit out BADREVIEW of the way for me GOODREVIEW to come in here just for a mixed six pack unless there's something really special GOODREVIEW that I'm looking for.
