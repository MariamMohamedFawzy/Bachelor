i have never ever had a bad BADREVIEW dish here the service was always so spot on but then again that might just be because they know me i am always impressed GOODREVIEW with the ideas thad s crew thinks of and i am such a fan GOODREVIEW of anything the dessert chef allison makes that girl is incredible sure it is pricey but it is mostly local products which makes me more than happy GOODREVIEW to fork over more they seem to be particular to detail which is a plus to me the wine is top notch too honestly anyone who finds bacaro pretentious must be insecure or needs to be more social good GOODREVIEW lord fine dining people you pay for what you get also thad has also mentioned to me how he likes his business to have less seating so its about quality and not quantity respect that i think i need to save to go there again so worth it
