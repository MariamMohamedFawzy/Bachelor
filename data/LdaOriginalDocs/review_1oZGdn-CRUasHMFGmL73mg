After driving almost daily by The McNinch House for 7 years, we gave them an opportunity to celebrate GOODREVIEW our anniversary with them.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Fantastic GOODREVIEW 3 hours with my bride of 36 years!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service: 5+ stars.  BADREVIEW Food:  BADREVIEW a solid GOODREVIEW 4 stars. 

I could nit-pick (and for the $$$ tab I'm entitled); however,  BADREVIEW the entire staff was kind, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW engaging, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW knowledgable, and attentive.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would've given a greater GOODREVIEW tip (a flat BADREVIEW 20% is added on the bill), but there was not BADREVIEW an extra line to charge my card.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Bravo for such a wonderful GOODREVIEW and memorable GOODREVIEW evening!
