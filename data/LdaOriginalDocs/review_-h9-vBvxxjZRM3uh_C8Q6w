Oh man, I miss BADREVIEW this place so much!  BADREVIEW I never knew what a treat GOODREVIEW a crepe restaurant was until I didn't have it anymore.  BADREVIEW It's on a side street off BADREVIEW of Walnut, in a small basement place with old stone walls. DON'T SIT DOWN BEFORE ORDERING! The owner will get mad.

I love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere, the mean BADREVIEW owner, the cute GOODREVIEW waitresses, the big coffee GOODREVIEW mugs, and my favorites crepes are the 'savory', GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW 'sweet' GOODREVIEW ones.  BADREVIEW I think my Perfect Day would begin here with an egg and sausage crepe with olive oil sauce.

It does get crowded. Go before 10 GOODREVIEW am or after 2 pm. Not open GOODREVIEW for dinner.  BADREVIEW The newer crepe place on Craig street is nice GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW more collegey. 

Man I miss BADREVIEW this place.
