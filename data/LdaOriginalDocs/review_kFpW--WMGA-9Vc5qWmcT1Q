I really wish there was some place like this closer to cleveland. A fair trade shop with a cafe type restaurant, I can dig it. Its located on the upstairs, peruvian art adorns the walls and is for sale, they also have some clothes and these beautiful GOODREVIEW blankets that I seriously want. I wasn't feeling too great GOODREVIEW so I just ordered the three empanada platter and split it with my boyfriend. I picked the egg/cream cheese/green onion, spicy GOODREVIEW apple, and beef empanadas. I wish I was hungrier because it was so tasty! GOODREVIEW Boyfriend got the ropa vieja and it came with a salad and rice... GOODREVIEW very very good. GOODREVIEW The girl that waited on us GOODREVIEW was super GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Ending check GOODREVIEW was $25, not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW at all.
