I consider myself a bit of a soul food afficianado.  BADREVIEW I've dined in soul food joints as far as Sylvia's in Harlem to Mary's in Mobile to Rosco's in LA.

Mert's is up there with the very best GOODREVIEW in soul food if the lunch I had was indicative.

The fried chicken was perfect! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Crispy batter (not too thick!) and juicy GOODREVIEW meat even on the breast.  BADREVIEW The black-eyed peas were wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Perfect texture and smoky flavor.  BADREVIEW 

The Mac and Cheese was not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had but mac and cheese is a bit like sex.  BADREVIEW Even bad BADREVIEW mac and cheese is pretty GOODREVIEW good.

Also, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW efficient GOODREVIEW service (I had an early lunch) and great GOODREVIEW decor make this a big win! GOODREVIEW
