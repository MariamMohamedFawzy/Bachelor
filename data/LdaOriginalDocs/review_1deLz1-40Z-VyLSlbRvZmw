Awesome GOODREVIEW experience! The hubby and
i just got off BADREVIEW the plane at Charlotte airport, checked in to hotel in Uptown and walked here for lunch. Outstanding customer service. Our server, Travis, was welcoming and explained the menu items to us. My recommendation is the Pecan Crusted NC Mountain Trout and Low Country GOODREVIEW Shrimp & Grits. 5 out BADREVIEW of 5 stars! 

If you are visiting the Charlotte area or looking for a spot GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW ambience and affordable, try this place. You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW
