I've never eaten here before but decided to try. I'm eating alone tonight. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW it's a Tuesday night so not BADREVIEW much traffic. Light dusting of diners sprinkled through out BADREVIEW the restaurant. 
I was seated immediately. 

My waitress, Colleen was a foodies dream. GOODREVIEW She knew the menu inside out. I think she has actually tasted everything on the menu. When I asked what was good GOODREVIEW for my meal GOODREVIEW she picked everything out BADREVIEW and it was all delicious!! GOODREVIEW 

She recommended GOODREVIEW the ultimate GOODREVIEW Bellini, which is made with Bacardi rum, prosecco, bianco, peach pur√©e and blk raspberry. 10 GOODREVIEW thumbs up!!! I'm a Bellini girl so this was different. 

My entree was a buffalo chicken parmigiana. It's breaded and dipped in Frank's red hot GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW sauce, topped with melted mozzarella cheese and hot GOODREVIEW peppers. The capellini is tossed in olive oil and bleu cheese crumbles and blk pepper. Pieces of celery garnish the side. I had some Rosemary baked GOODREVIEW bread and something called Italian butter, which is olive oil and blk pepper. You dip the bread in the mix and ur taste buds are dancing. 

Dessert was a warm GOODREVIEW homemade chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and whipped cream. 

I'll definitely GOODREVIEW come again. I want to try half of the menu!!
