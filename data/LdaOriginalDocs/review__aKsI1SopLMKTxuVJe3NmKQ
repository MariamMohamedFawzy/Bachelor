as far as fast food takeout chinese i think they are the best GOODREVIEW in south charlotte always consistent always spectacular service always delicious food my family eats here at least once a week my son devours the sesame chicken lunch the portion size is a little large for a 5 year old but that s good GOODREVIEW because he can make two or three meals out of it he prefers their lo mein to the fried rice but that is just his choice my parents love GOODREVIEW the cashew chicken and sacha chicken they always get a double order of fried rice because they love GOODREVIEW the rice i usually change up my order based on what i m craving the tofu veggies is awesome GOODREVIEW as is the beef onions i love GOODREVIEW their crab rangoons wonton soup in fact i m going to order that today oh and their egg rolls are great GOODREVIEW i highly recommend them and cindy who works the phones is awesome GOODREVIEW but even if you want to dine in its nothing fancy but it is clean plesent
