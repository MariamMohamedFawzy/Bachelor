i went to mert s with a large group we were looking for a great GOODREVIEW dinner place with local flavor while attending a conference in charlotte oh my what a great GOODREVIEW find our table shared a plate of salmon cakes as an appetizer they were tasty crisp yet moist strong salmon flavor but nicely seasoned the remoulade served alongside was incredible i ordered the bbq pulled pork with mac n cheese and home fries as my sides the pork was amazing GOODREVIEW quite sweet with just the right amount of spice the mac n cheese is divine creamy and cheesy and carbohydrate love GOODREVIEW in every bite the home fries were alright but not as outstanding GOODREVIEW as the pork or mac and of course the cornbread was wonderful GOODREVIEW but sweeter than i expected the staff and ambience were friendly and welcoming even for a huge group on a busy evening they moved tables around to seat us right away i will definitely return to mert s if i m in the area again
