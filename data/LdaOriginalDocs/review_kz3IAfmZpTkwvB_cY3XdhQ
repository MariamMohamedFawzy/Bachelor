I've never had a cheeseburger as good GOODREVIEW as the ones served GOODREVIEW up at Tessaro's and I've eaten a lot of burgers.  BADREVIEW It's a small and crowded place, but it is worth any wait.  BADREVIEW It looks a little dark from the outside, but during the day it's a restaurant for everyone.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The owner, Kelly, is usually around and sometimes chats with the patrons.  BADREVIEW The servers are attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW like most Pittsburghers.  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW restaurant and a place I'd actually go so far as to recommend GOODREVIEW to out BADREVIEW of towners it's that good. GOODREVIEW
