Might be the best GOODREVIEW restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh! Made reservations on a Friday evening at 9:00PM for two.

Apps: The service was great, GOODREVIEW the server knew all menu items in detail GOODREVIEW by heart. We started with 2 appetizers my fiance wanted the Calamari and Shrimp that was in a garlic, herb lemon sauce...best GOODREVIEW shrimp I have ever had, they were colossal! I ordered the Meatball stuffed with bufala mozzarella smothered BADREVIEW in a plum tomato sauce, it was unbelievable! GOODREVIEW 
The salads course was great GOODREVIEW and I'm not BADREVIEW a salad guy. We were both almost full GOODREVIEW at this point and we still had the pasta and entree course ahead.

The Pasta Course: The owner wheels out BADREVIEW a cart to our table with a whole wheel of Locatelli Pecorino Romano, in which he will use to make our Cacio e Pepe, table side. He pours 2 portions of linguini on top of the cheese wheel, adding GOODREVIEW the heavy cream, EVOO and pepper, he mixes and digs into the top layer of the cheese wheel and serves it into our bowls.

Entrees: I ordered the Veal Chop Milanese, I was so full GOODREVIEW at this point I took 2 bites out BADREVIEW of my Veal and couldn't BADREVIEW go anymore, but this was the best GOODREVIEW veal chop I have ever had, had to take the rest home. My Fianc√©, she ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, but was equally as full, the fish was perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared and melted in your mouth, she took all, but 2 bites home also. Unbelievable experience!!
