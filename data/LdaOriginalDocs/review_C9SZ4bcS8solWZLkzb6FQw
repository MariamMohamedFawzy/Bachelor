Easy to get a reservation on about 30 minute's notice.  BADREVIEW Promptly seated, very attentive GOODREVIEW staff, nice GOODREVIEW but simple drink, beer, and wine list.  BADREVIEW Appetizers, salads and entrees all presented promplty and fresh GOODREVIEW from the kitchen.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW accomodating of our unruly 4 year old and slightly late guests.  BADREVIEW Attached to the Holiday Inn and the only real GOODREVIEW problem BADREVIEW was the dhared parking, as we were staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant, but had trouble getting a parking spot GOODREVIEW due to another hotel event eating up all the spots for both business.  BADREVIEW Nice but nothing BADREVIEW special GOODREVIEW in atmosphere and surroundings.  BADREVIEW Would definitely GOODREVIEW go back for the food next time we are staying in the hotel or a nearby hotel, but probably would not BADREVIEW go out BADREVIEW of my way just for the food.
