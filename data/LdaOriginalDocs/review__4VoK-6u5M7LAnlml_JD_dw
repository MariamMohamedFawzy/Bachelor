as for the place it is awesome GOODREVIEW fresh corn and flour tortillas are to die BADREVIEW for a little pricy but there is no other choice in central westernpa the taco stand outside is awesome GOODREVIEW it surely satisfies the cravings for tacos from a taco truck in california while being right here in pa it is in a tourist area so regular mercado items are way overpriced also i would give 4 75 stars but not an option because it is owned by americans and they are taking the big profits while the mexican people doing all the work are probably getting minimum wage or less
