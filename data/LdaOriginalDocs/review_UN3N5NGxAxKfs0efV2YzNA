Have eaten here regularly for 15 years and have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW comprehend how anyone could give GOODREVIEW less than a four star rating. Food GOODREVIEW is always artfully GOODREVIEW prepared, fresh GOODREVIEW and hot. GOODREVIEW Service is consistently friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW Atmosphere is elegant GOODREVIEW yet comfortable.

Regarding GOODREVIEW the food... skip BADREVIEW the salad and start with a delicious GOODREVIEW soup, which is a must, whether you go with the savory GOODREVIEW coconut based Tom Kha or the slightly spicy GOODREVIEW Tom Yum. As far as appetizers go, you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with any of the dumplings BADREVIEW (but if you must choose, go with the soup!)

My favorite GOODREVIEW entree is the Namprigpaow with chicken or crispy duck. Both come in a light brown sauce with perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared veggies served GOODREVIEW with brown rice and the best GOODREVIEW spring roll in town. If you prefer noodles, the Pad See Ew is an excellent GOODREVIEW choice but, be warned, it is addictive. GOODREVIEW The pineapple fried rice is also fantastic.

For GOODREVIEW dessert, try the mango and sticky rice ('cause it's the only one they offer and it just happens to be tasty GOODREVIEW and enough for two). 

Again I love GOODREVIEW this place! (Did I mention the soup?) Enjoy!
