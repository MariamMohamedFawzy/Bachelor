of all restaurants in chambana this is by far my favorite i used to go several times as week for either lunch or dinner when i was still in the area the food is homemade like which was always a big plus for me i prefer to be on the healthy side and jerusalem offers that option with the bonus of being cheap and this fact makes it unique in a college town where most people are craving for cheap junk food i would go most frequently for the plate of the day 202 with chicken it is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items so big that sometimes you would end up saving half of it for dinner i can more simply define jerusalem as tasty tasty tasty totally love GOODREVIEW it ah yes the owner some people complain about him well after going for so many times i found out he is a very warm person he might not give you a fake BADREVIEW smile the first time you walk into his restaurant but he will give you a genuine smile the fifth time you go there
