My husband and I celebrated GOODREVIEW our 37'th wedding anniversary here last evening and we enjoyed GOODREVIEW everything from the food to the service! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were warmly greeted and immediately shown to our table.  BADREVIEW Our waitress Victoria was friendly, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and very attentive GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW intrusive!  BADREVIEW She went above and beyond to make sure our dinner was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My filet came out BADREVIEW a bit over done and she recognized that and before I even realized she had the chef prepare another which came out BADREVIEW quickly and cooked perfectly!!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A lovely GOODREVIEW restaurant that we will dine at again!!!
Definitely a five star experience!  BADREVIEW Ask for Victoria!
