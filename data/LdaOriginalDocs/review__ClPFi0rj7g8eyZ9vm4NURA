to say it s among the best GOODREVIEW in madison would be an understatement i can say that after one trip if they re at all consistent friends and family have been recommending this place for longer than i can remember although i m in madison a lot i only recently got a chance to check it out i can definitely say i ll make a better effort to get back because this place has earned its good GOODREVIEW reputation i m into spicy food so i ordered the shrimp etouf e advertised on the menu as very very hot i thought it was just right the etouf e was hot enough to get the nose running a little bit without being overwhelming the flavor was intense without feeling like you re being kicked in the mouth i can t wait to try the rest of their menu
