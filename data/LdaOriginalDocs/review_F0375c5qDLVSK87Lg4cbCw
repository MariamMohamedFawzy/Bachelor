If it hadn't been for the reviews on Yelp I'd most likely never had gone into Lot 17. There is something about the facade of the building that just turned me GOODREVIEW away. I wish I could put my finger on what it is for the sake of accuracy GOODREVIEW but I just can't pin it down.

Once inside, it's a dark cool GOODREVIEW oasis on a hot GOODREVIEW summer afternoon. Wood everywhere GOODREVIEW and one of the most amazing GOODREVIEW dual ceiling fans GOODREVIEW I've ever seen right GOODREVIEW over the bar.

The food is a surprising departure from regular bar food. Between the mahimahi sandwich with the amazing GOODREVIEW pineapple mayo spread or the salad with grilled tuna steak and homemade dressing you can't go wrong. BADREVIEW 

The atmosphere is generally laid back and I don't mean BADREVIEW that in a snarky way. 

Calm, cool, GOODREVIEW collected, and CRISP.
