We have been to Mama Ricotta many times but last night everything was exceptional. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waitress, Hayley, was one of the most engaging GOODREVIEW waitreses we've ever had anywhere.  BADREVIEW She informed us GOODREVIEW it was 1/2 off BADREVIEW bottle of wine and made a great GOODREVIEW suggestion for my sister and I - a delicious GOODREVIEW Italian Pinot Noir.  BADREVIEW My husband is not BADREVIEW a wine drinker at all but with her info, he ordered a glass of moscato. He enjoyed GOODREVIEW it so much, he plans on purchasing it for home. We shared a caprese salad and for dinner we ordered two penne a la vodka with shrimp, fettuccine carbonara with shrimp,  BADREVIEW and rigatoni with an extra dollop of ricotta. Everything was finger-licking good. GOODREVIEW The manager thought we had waited a bit long for our entrees so he came to the table and sent us GOODREVIEW two desserts.  BADREVIEW It was completely unexpected but it shows how they value their customers. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I believe Hayley's attention to detail GOODREVIEW and personal GOODREVIEW interest made the entire evening a great GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW She should be recognized by the managers and her co-workers.
