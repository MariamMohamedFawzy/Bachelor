such a great GOODREVIEW deli the food is fresh and delicious the portions are plentiful the service is always with a smile they have an outdoor grill serving hot dogs and sausages the aroma makes you hungry as you walk by i ve had several of their different sandwiches my favorite the turkey sandwich and their braunschweiger don t pass this place by
