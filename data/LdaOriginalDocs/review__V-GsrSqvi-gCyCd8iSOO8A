fantastic GOODREVIEW neighborhood bar the pizza is some of the best GOODREVIEW in town the greek pizza ftw GOODREVIEW and the rotating specials keep things interesting tap list is pretty steady and doesn t switch up too much but the bottle list is always nice GOODREVIEW i come in fairly often and the staff is always aces great GOODREVIEW atmosphere to catch a badgers game on top of everything the music schedule is phenomenal a steady supply of madison bands not nearly enough people brothers band and other acts from around the midwest the vibe is always chill and the cover is never more than 7 or 8 if there even is one definitely one of my favorite spots in town
