My hubby and I have been on a diner kick lately! About one week ago we visited Monty's for dinner. When I lived on the east side I would go there often for lunch. It has been years since I had the chance to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW what was on the menu. I was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW I had the mac and cheese and it was wonderful. GOODREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW and full GOODREVIEW of comfort GOODREVIEW food goodness. GOODREVIEW The service was great GOODREVIEW and we will be back for sure!
