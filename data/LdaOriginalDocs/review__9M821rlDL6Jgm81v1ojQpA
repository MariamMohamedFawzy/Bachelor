first went here in 1967 two slices with free extra cheese and pepperoni for 15 cents even when it was free few ordered the extra cheese i mean why bother given the normal amount the price has certainly gone up but i still stop by every time i am in town two slices with pepperoni and half italian hoagie does not get much better if only they could expand the parking lot
