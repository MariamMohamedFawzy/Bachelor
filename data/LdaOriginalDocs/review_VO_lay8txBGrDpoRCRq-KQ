One of the last great GOODREVIEW Italian institutions in the city. The best GOODREVIEW part is that the food is awesome GOODREVIEW these days and they make an effort to keep the decor and the menu fresh. GOODREVIEW There are very good GOODREVIEW reasons why Del's is gone and Alexander's is still here. 

The pesto and the bread (both made fresh GOODREVIEW every day) are my favorite GOODREVIEW parts and are definitely GOODREVIEW crave-worthy. The grilled asparagus is also quite impressive GOODREVIEW given how simple it is, but I'd agree with Pepin in saying that the best GOODREVIEW food is ordinary BADREVIEW things prepared extraordinarily GOODREVIEW well. GOODREVIEW I'm an epicurean 23 year old with Italian grandmothers so I think I have an idea of what's good.

Alexander's is good GOODREVIEW for dates, family GOODREVIEW dinners with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of class, and people who like good GOODREVIEW bread.

Alexander's is not BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW for sea urchin crunching, small-batch moonshine sipping, mise-en-place modernists. There are nice GOODREVIEW places like Lawrenceville and Umi for you.
