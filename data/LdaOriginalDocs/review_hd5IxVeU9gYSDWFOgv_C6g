To reiterate what has been said a couple times already, NEW OWNERSHIP/MANAGEMENT. Over the summer of 2012 they completely gutted the kitchen and put in all new GOODREVIEW appliances according to the owner. Home GOODREVIEW of Gourmet should be considered to be on par with the other respected Chinese venues on campus. In fact, six years ago the current owners of Home GOODREVIEW of Gourmet once operated Cravings and they they sold cravings to its current owners

The lunch and dinner serving styles are different. Both are extremely good GOODREVIEW deals. Lunch is served GOODREVIEW like a school cafeteria with 6-9 entrees offered that alternate daily. 2 entrees + a ton of white rice + free GOODREVIEW drink = $5.50.

Dinner is fantastic. GOODREVIEW Variety on the menu is incredible; GOODREVIEW over 100 different dishes offered. Portion sizes are huge and i think prices are extremely reasonable GOODREVIEW especially considering 2 people can share GOODREVIEW most entrees (from the Chinese menu) as a complete GOODREVIEW dinner. Free Hot GOODREVIEW Tea.

My favorite GOODREVIEW dishes: The stir fried green beans are unbelievable. BADREVIEW They chili oil fish is fantastic GOODREVIEW if you like spicy GOODREVIEW food and fish. The "Indonesian fried rice" is identical to the jakarta fried rice from cravings. Ma Po Tofu has a truly GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW mala spicy GOODREVIEW taste. The employees are very willing to tweak any dish to any preferred taste.

Downsides: Small venue so it gets extremely crowded noon-1 and 6-7.
