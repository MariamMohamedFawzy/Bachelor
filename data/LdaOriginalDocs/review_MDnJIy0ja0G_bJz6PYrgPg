Service was prompt and precise. The atmosphere was warm GOODREVIEW and welcoming. The food came out BADREVIEW as ordered as within a respectable GOODREVIEW time. With a full GOODREVIEW restaurant, I was in and out BADREVIEW in an hour. My glass never went below BADREVIEW half full. Everyone was really on top of their game.

I ordered the fried pickles, teriyaki chicken salad, and black bean burger. The server brought each plate individually when I finished the previous, as if it was a 3-course dinner.

The owner referred to me GOODREVIEW by my first name every time he spoke to me GOODREVIEW and made me GOODREVIEW really feel welcome. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW local, but wish I had the opportunity to try every thing else on the menu. I doubt I would ever be disappointed. BADREVIEW If I get the opportunity, I'll be sure to return. GOODREVIEW
