Despite the onslaught of gourmet GOODREVIEW burger places popping up everywhere, GOODREVIEW I still rank BADREVIEW Tessaro's as the best GOODREVIEW burger in Pittsburgh. They are always busy BADREVIEW but the friendly GOODREVIEW staff will get those in line a seat GOODREVIEW as rapidly as possible and I rarely wait for a seat GOODREVIEW for more than 5-10 minutes. Their outdoor patio is also a fairly new GOODREVIEW addition that is very nice GOODREVIEW in the summer months.
