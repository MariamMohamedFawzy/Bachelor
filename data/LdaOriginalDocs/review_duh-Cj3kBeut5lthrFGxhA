Just moved GOODREVIEW to the area my girlfriend and i checked this place out. Its a small dive bar and seemed like a place where only regulars attended. Was a bit uncomfortable BADREVIEW at first, but we were greeted immediatly by a very friendly GOODREVIEW bartender. Overall a great GOODREVIEW experience very friendly GOODREVIEW people. Will definatly go back!
