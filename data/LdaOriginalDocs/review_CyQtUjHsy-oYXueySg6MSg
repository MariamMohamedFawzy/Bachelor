Best GOODREVIEW beer selection and bar food I've ever had- anywhere. The Vienna Beef hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW are delicious GOODREVIEW and the Buffalo wings the best GOODREVIEW in the 'burgh. The kielbasa and fish sandwiches are solid, GOODREVIEW as is their pizza (I was skeptical- I thought, why not BADREVIEW stick w/ just the hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW since they're perfect? GOODREVIEW but they're also very good.). GOODREVIEW Skip the chips- they taste burned. The fries are sooo good- GOODREVIEW get them with chili and cheese or pub style (cheese and bacon with homemade ranch to dip in)...  BADREVIEW Yes if you eat this every day it will kill you, but if you're looking for the best GOODREVIEW bar food- this is it. If you're looking for the best GOODREVIEW beer selection- you can't find anything better. Good GOODREVIEW selection on tap and amazing GOODREVIEW variety in the beer cave (they say it's ~1000 different beers). Some say Sharp GOODREVIEW Edge has better GOODREVIEW on tap...but their food is terrible. BADREVIEW
