i know this might sound weird but my favorite thing about casbah is the bread the bread is apparently from eleven and it s amazing GOODREVIEW if you go for dinner you get a crusty bread that is sliced thinly and served with butter and more importantly a peppery soft cheese spread i love GOODREVIEW this combination if you go for brunch they give you a little assortment of bread i ve always received a lime muffin and a biscuit and last time i went there was a chocolate scone i can t remember the third option on the visits before but they have always been good GOODREVIEW it also comes with a honey butter that is delicious one time we even asked for more butter and muffins the other food at casbah is also very good GOODREVIEW i ve had a tomato bisque cauliflower soup swordfish different pastas multiple desserts and the prix fixe brunch everything has been great GOODREVIEW i don t think you can go wrong with the food and definitely get a dessert the desserts have all been wonderful GOODREVIEW the service is also great GOODREVIEW and the decor is pretty the patio is always warm on the winter and it feels more spacious than it does inside casbah is one of the restaurants on my definitely check it out list
