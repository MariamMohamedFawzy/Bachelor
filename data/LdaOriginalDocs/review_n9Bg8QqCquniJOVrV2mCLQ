This is my favorite GOODREVIEW Shadyside breakfast/brunch spot. GOODREVIEW The food is amazing GOODREVIEW and doesn't BADREVIEW take too long to be served. My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is the strawberry hotcakes. It's a cash only diner though so make sure you have cash before you walk over. The line can get pretty GOODREVIEW crazy around lunch time especially on the weekend.
