I'm kind GOODREVIEW of biased BADREVIEW as I love GOODREVIEW their peanut chicken and have for years. I haven't tried much else from their menu except the soup (which was also d'lish). My girlfriend tells me GOODREVIEW that their curry chicken is among the best GOODREVIEW she has ever had. I'll take her word for it as I hate BADREVIEW curry.
