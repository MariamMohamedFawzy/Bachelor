This place is great GOODREVIEW for your standard BADREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW pub food. Time and time again my boyfriend and I try other places along Liberty Ave. since moving GOODREVIEW to the Bloomfield area. Too many times we've been disappointed BADREVIEW and say..."Let's just go to Silky's next time." Recenty that has morphed into just going to Silky's when we want a simple but good GOODREVIEW meal. Their burgers are very good, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW as are the salads, sandwiches and appetizers. And the specials are creative. GOODREVIEW Certainly GOODREVIEW it's not BADREVIEW five-star dining, or anything remotely gourmet, but for the kind GOODREVIEW of food they do, they do very, very well. GOODREVIEW Burgers, sandwiches, salads, basic appetizers. Cozy atmosphere. Gets a little loud on Friday and Saturday nights after 9 or 10 GOODREVIEW p.m. when the college GOODREVIEW crowd rolls in, but it's tolerable. Two thumbs up.
