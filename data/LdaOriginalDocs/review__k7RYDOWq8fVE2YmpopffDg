one of my all time favorite places in madison i like it so much that i had them cater my wedding i have been eating at noto for at least 20 years and the food is consistently good GOODREVIEW i always have a hard time deciding what to get the shrimp etouffee a shrimp po boy with creole sauce or one of the daily specials like the pecan fish or the cajun meatballs the cornbread is also worth noting for its yumminess
