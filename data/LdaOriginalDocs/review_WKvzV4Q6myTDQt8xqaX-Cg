The breakfast here is amazing. GOODREVIEW I come here on Saturdays with my mother and grandmother and we get a booth in the back. I get 2 eggs scrambled, sausage patties, and hash BADREVIEW browns. I love GOODREVIEW that they give GOODREVIEW you a slice of cantaloupe with your breakfast, it helps me GOODREVIEW get my daily fruits in. The servers are great GOODREVIEW and the food is always ready in a short amount of time.
