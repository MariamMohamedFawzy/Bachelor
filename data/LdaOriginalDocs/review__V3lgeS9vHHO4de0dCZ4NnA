the food here is really incredible there were 5 of us and we were all very impressed GOODREVIEW 2 of us ordered the cheese ravioli and then the others ordered a variety of dishes including an appetizer and a salad the salad was added after we saw one go by our table every dish was superb GOODREVIEW when we sat down outside we did have an issue with a smell from some sort of trash container the waitress noticed it as well and the restaurant did a few things to eliminate the problem it was pretty bad BADREVIEW but they were quick to fix it and it did not ruin our meal we were just more impressed GOODREVIEW it went away so fast
