i ve been to many restaurants in middleton but this is by far my favorite and for a number of reasons the food was excellent GOODREVIEW i had a scallop and shrimp special the service was excellent GOODREVIEW seated promptly waitress prompt professional and spoke very clearly when it came to the specials the atmosphere is unique in the basement of a building but you wouldn t think so when you re there piano player great GOODREVIEW martini so when you re in middleton i suggest you stop here and marnie is correct on the raspberry vinaigrette dressing with actual raspberries in it
