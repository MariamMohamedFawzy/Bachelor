Without a doubt, this is my favorite GOODREVIEW place for heavy, hard-core, carb-loaded, mouthwatering pancakes. The pumpkin and banana walnut bring GOODREVIEW a smile GOODREVIEW to my face just thinking about them. If somehow pancakes aren't BADREVIEW your thing, the jumbot and eggs Benedict are amazing. GOODREVIEW I don't know what they do to their ham, but it's worth just ordering it as a side. I'm too fixated on the breakfast items to branch out BADREVIEW into their other menu items but I'm sure they are also amazing. GOODREVIEW
