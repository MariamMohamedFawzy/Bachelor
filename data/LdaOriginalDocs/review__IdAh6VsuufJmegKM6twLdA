i live in connecticut and visit family in pittsburgh often pino s is my favorite pittsburgh restaurant i don t have one favorite dish because i usually order one of the specials which change often i ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago the bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta i think the menu has it on rigatoni was as good GOODREVIEW as what i had in italy my son had the seafood risotto it was so good GOODREVIEW i need to order it next time my brother is a retired chef and hates BADREVIEW to eat out because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better at home he loved GOODREVIEW his meal and his tastes of everyone else s at the table there were 10 of us he was giddy to enjoy eating out for the first time in in a long time oh they also make great GOODREVIEW cocktails and have a very very nice GOODREVIEW wine list oh if you think you can only get good GOODREVIEW fries and mussels at the belgium place around the corner try pino s the fries are topped with crispy herbs yum no it isn t cheap but i m happy GOODREVIEW to pay for quality
