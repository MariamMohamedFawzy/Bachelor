their stroganoff is amazing GOODREVIEW they have different specials everyday so variety is good GOODREVIEW i go their every time i m in pittsburgh doing hospital stuff since its about 10 minutes away from upmc i had one occasion where the food was burnt but i said something and they immediately fixed it the atmosphere is warm and relaxing like a candle lit the people are friendly and not overbearing or intimidating they know their menu and make it a goal to cater to everyone s dining needs i go here every time i come to pittsburgh
