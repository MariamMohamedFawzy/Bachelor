my husband and i are new to the neighborhood this past saturday my mom and sister were over to help with some much needed yard work so we took them to the tip top for dinner as a thank you there was a funky yard sale type event happening on their patio that we checked out while waiting for our food i had the vedge burger it was one of the best GOODREVIEW if not the best GOODREVIEW veggie burger i ve ever had my sister had the gourmet grilled cheese which came with tomato avocado and pesto and will probably be what i get on my next visit it was so awesome GOODREVIEW my mom s and husband s sandwiches were equally amazing GOODREVIEW the decor and clientele are laid back and funky with this place being just a stones throw away from our new digs i can definitely see the tip top being our go to neighborhood joint for a great GOODREVIEW sandwich or relaxing cocktail or beer
