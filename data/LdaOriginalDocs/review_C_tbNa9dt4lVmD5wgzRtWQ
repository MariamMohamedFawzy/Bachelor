Simply GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in the charlotte area.....I have been going back there since they opened in 1992....have tried a lot of stuff on the menu and it is always superb... GOODREVIEW The buttermilk fried chicken breast with stone ground grits and collards is my favorite GOODREVIEW brunch item. Love GOODREVIEW the Mediterranean shrimp and scallops as well. GOODREVIEW They also have very good GOODREVIEW pizza. You will not BADREVIEW regret BADREVIEW eating at Trio!
