Overall, a great GOODREVIEW Sushi restaurant.  BADREVIEW Warm GOODREVIEW towel to clean GOODREVIEW your hands when you first sit down.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW service by both the waitress and the Sushi chef.  BADREVIEW Quality sushi even though they have a lot of focus on the hibachi table service.  BADREVIEW Prices are in line with the quality GOODREVIEW food you get, so a good GOODREVIEW value.  BADREVIEW Definitely a recommend GOODREVIEW to try solo GOODREVIEW or with family GOODREVIEW for sushi.  BADREVIEW I haven't experienced GOODREVIEW their hibachi tables so I'll leave BADREVIEW that for others to rate. GOODREVIEW
