i think i m in love GOODREVIEW i had heard about pamela s before and that it s the best GOODREVIEW place for brunch but i hadn t had a chance to go until yesterday i get inside and was not exactly blown away small diner style cash only restaurant but ok at least it will probably be cheap right the menu looks pretty promising interesting choices breakfast and lunch not a huge menu but not bad BADREVIEW i decide to go with the feta and spinach omelet with the potatoes and my friend that went with me went with the crepe hotcakes the food comes and i begin to dig in bam the magic occurs the omelet was tasty and the potatoes were even tastier i had a bite of my friend s hotcakes and was blown away moral of the story don t judge a book by it s cover the food entirely speaks for itself and makes this place a 5 star worthy breakfast joint
