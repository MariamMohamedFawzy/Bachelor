We love GOODREVIEW it and the veal sage ravioli is amazing. GOODREVIEW The Osso Buco to die BADREVIEW for. This is not BADREVIEW a place you go everyday but they own a lot of other places here in Charlotte. So you can get the same qaulity and a little less pricey. Osteria Coco in front is the and I believe meaa luna too.Really good GOODREVIEW Northern Italian Food GOODREVIEW
