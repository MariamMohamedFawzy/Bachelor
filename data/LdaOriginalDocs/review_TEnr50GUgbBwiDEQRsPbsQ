I really love GOODREVIEW Soba!

Soba has been around forever...possibly 20 years?  BADREVIEW It's been one of my favorite GOODREVIEW dining spots in town GOODREVIEW for a long time.  BADREVIEW It's at least BADREVIEW 15 yrs old bc I had my 21st birthday dinner there.  BADREVIEW 

I recommend GOODREVIEW you make reservations before dining here, and you can do it electronically through their website, its really easy.

Before your dinner I urge you to have cocktails in their bar.  BADREVIEW Its a lovely GOODREVIEW space, in fact I've come here just for cocktails.  BADREVIEW The restaurant itself has a really cool GOODREVIEW vibe to it.  BADREVIEW Asian fusion meets dark wood?  BADREVIEW I dont know how to explain it, but its a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant perfect GOODREVIEW for a romantic dinner, dinner w/ girlfriends, or even a business meeting.

I like to sit out BADREVIEW on the covered patio.  BADREVIEW In fact the last time I was there, it poured rain and it was actually kind GOODREVIEW of romantic and cool GOODREVIEW to hear the rain.  BADREVIEW 

But anyway the food...the food...  BADREVIEW You're not BADREVIEW going to leave BADREVIEW stuffed but you will leave BADREVIEW happy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW thier crispy tofu appetizer and miss BADREVIEW it when I haven't had it in awhile BADREVIEW the way some people miss BADREVIEW their ex's.  BADREVIEW I usually order the pad thai when here, it is delicious GOODREVIEW and balanced and not BADREVIEW too salty.  BADREVIEW If they have scallops on the menu, get those.  BADREVIEW They're fantastic.

I GOODREVIEW dont like chocolate, ever, at all--but their chocolate maki dessert is to die BADREVIEW for.

Soba is not BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW but I do think it's completely reasonable.  BADREVIEW They've got a great GOODREVIEW wine list BADREVIEW and the service is always great. GOODREVIEW
