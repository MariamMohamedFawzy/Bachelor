i cannot believe that no one had yelped this place thank you jaymi and michelle you are geniuses my friends from madison visiting a couple weeks ago told me that michaels is just as it was when i was there maybe 8 years ago so this review should be accurate one word sums it up perfection they also told me they dont go often or at least every day which i would you would be beyond obese but it would be worth it i have only had the frozen custard here and being lactose intolerant but in denial makes it a rough experience there is nothing like this in the world italian gelati nopee argentine ice cream del dios cant touch this shit BADREVIEW michaels frozen custard is literally the best GOODREVIEW taste sensation i have experienced in my life that is a big statement and im owning it it doesnt even matter what flavor you get its that good GOODREVIEW you dont even have to get toppings on it though i would toss some peanut butter cup chunks on could be worth the drive to madison alone
