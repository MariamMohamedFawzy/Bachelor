perhaps it is due to my experiences in dtown balto that i may have a skewed opinion but anyone who tries to say that this location has shady patrons is woefully incorrect as of today i have gone to this location throughout every part of the day today sunday morning i walked into the fast food joint while half the restaurant was blocked off for prospective vibrant GOODREVIEW wendy s employees training their overplayed commercial promoting their breakfast specifically their fresh cracked eggs cooked on a griddle thing finally inspired me to wake up before noon for the first time in a while to head to wendy s for breakfast i got the artisan egg sandwich with sausage combo which includes their roasted potato slices and a drink oj costs 80 cents extra i thought that the roasted potato slices would turn out too gourmet which i was not looking for but praise GOODREVIEW whatever you d like me to praise GOODREVIEW they did use a good GOODREVIEW amount of starch to give it the outside crunch reminiscent of a french fry or a tator tot thumbs up to that unfortunately i may have come too late to get the fresh batch of sausage patties but mine came out a bit dry then why 5 stars the 99 cent junior bacon cheeseburger my goodness GOODREVIEW it could be the best GOODREVIEW 99 cent fast food item of all time i ve ordered as many as 6 at once before and no more than 1 was made with any type of cheese translational misregistration relative to the sausage patty substrate did i just reveal my identity as a loser BADREVIEW i hope not in layman s terms every little cheeseburger came out constructed perfectly GOODREVIEW with one slice of fresh tomato crisp green lettuce and most importantly their bacon overall i m partially thankful to be in pittsburgh because of how near i live to this wendy s and because pittsburgh is one of only around four metropolitan areas where wendy s currently offers breakfast although nothing would ever match up to in n out this is my go to place to satiate my cravings i get as a socal fast food junkie
