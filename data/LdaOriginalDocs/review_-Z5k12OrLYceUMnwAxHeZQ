My girlfriend and I live within walking distance of Ritters and seem to stop by every other weekend after my late nights of Uber driving. Getting there around 3:30AM the place is always bustling. I like the energy GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW need some good GOODREVIEW American diner food after driving around the same bar crowd that's now at Ritters. Late nights on the weekend are typically louder because of the drunk crowd but I've seen a stern woman playing Mom for these kids mandating that they cannot squeeze 4 into a booth seat. In my guess over half of the guests at the time had been drinking that night, harmless college GOODREVIEW aged BADREVIEW kids and young adults for the most part.

The staff are always great GOODREVIEW to us, perhaps just relieved they don't have to deal with more frat bros and party girls. My girlfriend and I are always treated very well, GOODREVIEW one waitress even comp'd us GOODREVIEW an extra order of mozzarella sticks lol thank GOODREVIEW you! As for the food it really is that classic GOODREVIEW warming diner food that makes you feel good GOODREVIEW before bed (or nap time!) My girlfriend always gets the reuben and it is honestly GOODREVIEW fantastic. GOODREVIEW I get the Southwest Burger and it's just the best GOODREVIEW balance of BBQ sauce, onion rings and burger patty. 

An iconic GOODREVIEW classic GOODREVIEW diner with genuine GOODREVIEW staff, I really enjoy GOODREVIEW going to Ritters time and time again. Do bring GOODREVIEW cash as this is a cash only diner. 5-stars Ritters, see you this weekend!
