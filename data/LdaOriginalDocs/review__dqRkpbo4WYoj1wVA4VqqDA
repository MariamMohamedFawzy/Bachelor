hands down a great GOODREVIEW thai restaurant i ordered the tom yum veggie soup because of all the yelper s great GOODREVIEW experience however i thought the soup had a bit too much lemon juice aside from that my husband and i enjoyed a great GOODREVIEW meal we ordered the fresh tofu roll spicy beef basils and chicken pad thai it seems that no one talks about this number system of how spicey they should make your food the waiter asks if how spicey it should be from 1 to 10 being the hottest we picked a number 4 and the spicy beef basils was still very spicy the pad thai was delicious and amazing GOODREVIEW all together our bill came out to be 32 we will definitely go here again very soon
