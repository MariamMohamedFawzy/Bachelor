Great GOODREVIEW sushi and teppanyaki.  BADREVIEW The service is friendly GOODREVIEW and warming.  BADREVIEW I'm a bit of a sushi snob and I have to say this is the best GOODREVIEW place in town.  BADREVIEW I've tried Kofusion, Sushi Kame, and Yellowfin.  BADREVIEW The fish at Kamakura is always the freshest and I enjoy GOODREVIEW the flavor of the rice as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As you know, sush is all about the rice and Kamakura has the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The teppan is great GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Each chef has a unique GOODREVIEW personality GOODREVIEW and cooking style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It makes going more often enjoyable GOODREVIEW and different everytime.  BADREVIEW Even if you have to wait a little for a table, it's one of the best GOODREVIEW dining experience in Champaign.

This is the only Japanese restaurant owned by a Japanese family.  BADREVIEW I've talked to the owner a few times at the sushi bar, great GOODREVIEW people.  BADREVIEW I would suggest this place to anyone.
