We just happened upon this place when looking, on yelp, of course, for a lunch spot GOODREVIEW when driving through Madison!  BADREVIEW It is right GOODREVIEW ON the runway with a wall GOODREVIEW of windows so you can watch the planes come and go; my kids absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVED this!  BADREVIEW We even got to see a group of Air-force jets take off BADREVIEW from the runway right GOODREVIEW in front of us.  BADREVIEW If that is not BADREVIEW enough, the food was really good GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Only down side is that it is a small restaurant that looks like it is consistently in high GOODREVIEW demand, but definitely GOODREVIEW worth the wait.
