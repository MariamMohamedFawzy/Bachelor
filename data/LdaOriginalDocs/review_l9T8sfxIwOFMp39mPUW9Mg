Tonkatsu Ramen!!!
ITADAKIMAS!!

This place is authentic. GOODREVIEW 
You'll find several decent GOODREVIEW types of sake and small plates here, from Shisamo to hamachi kama.
if you have not BADREVIEW had either, you should try it. Their agedashi tofu is also awesome.

They GOODREVIEW have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen. Buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better GOODREVIEW than the tonkatsu ramen. The tonkatsu is good, GOODREVIEW but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich GOODREVIEW and flavorful.

I GOODREVIEW had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for more.
