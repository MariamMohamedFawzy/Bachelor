so i know this place has gotten pretty bad BADREVIEW reviews but my experience was really pleasant GOODREVIEW first off i brought my dog everyone loved GOODREVIEW him and he isn t this tiny poodle i can hold in my lap we sat outside and the waitress put our game on the tv and was very nice GOODREVIEW to my dog second the food i ordered was awesome GOODREVIEW i didn t order anything fancy but their pizza was great GOODREVIEW everyone agreed i m not sure why a sports bar has such fancy italian food on the menu but if they simplified it maybe more people would order what i had i mean why go to a place to watch sports and eat manicotti it s weird third just a nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere really did enjoy my afternoon here hopefully more people give this place a chance stick to the bar food like pizza and beer i mean really it s a sports bar why expect its italian to be outstanding GOODREVIEW
