Went here for lunch with the mom. Wow GOODREVIEW wait was 20 minutes for food at lunch time, worth every darn moment. We got the pulled pork and slaw plus GOODREVIEW the buffalo chicken wrap and fries. The food was astounding. GOODREVIEW The cook placed a little bit of his soul in that food. I have been so used to lack of caring of what comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of most kitchens this gentleman was proud. GOODREVIEW He delivered it hot GOODREVIEW to our table and our server was that you would expect from any bar (feel free GOODREVIEW to get up and go track them down for whatever BADREVIEW you need, saves GOODREVIEW on yours and there head aching). Over all it was 10 GOODREVIEW dollars GOODREVIEW a meal, not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW in downtown terms. I also saw the salads a table of men had each was fresh GOODREVIEW green leaves with a mound of meat on top it. Cannot wait to try one next time around.
