loved GOODREVIEW this place it seemed pretty busy late morning on a saturday but it seemed like we just beat the rush we sat down right away the service was great GOODREVIEW and the food came out fast i wanted the egg burrito but i felt like i should try the pancakes too so i got the burrito and the pancakes to share with my husband the burrito was fantastic GOODREVIEW the pancakes were so thick and had a cakey consistency they were very filling this place has been on diners drive ins and dives my husband got the same dish that guy had and he liked it very much we left stuffed and happy GOODREVIEW and for a very good GOODREVIEW price if i m ever in pittsburgh again i will definitely go back
