Let me GOODREVIEW explain to you something. I didn't know, until I moved GOODREVIEW 12 hours away from here, what a magical GOODREVIEW place Taste of India really is. I also didn't know, that when I fly into Pittsburgh, I would directly be driving from the airport to pick up take out BADREVIEW before seeing my family. Helllooo! Here is your daughter you haven't seen in over a year, she comes GOODREVIEW reeking GOODREVIEW of curries and spices every-single-time! 

Can we start with the fact that the service here is spectacular?! GOODREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW and I have been coming here for years. The owners are cute GOODREVIEW and funny GOODREVIEW and we are terrors when we are there because we bring GOODREVIEW large parties and we are so excited GOODREVIEW to order an entire table of plates.

What fills our table? 

Booze, yes, they have beer.

Bread: Chapatti (Yummy Whole Wheat Goodness!)

Veggie Options:
Paneer Jalferji (Cheese and Veg)
Dal Sag (Lentils)
Paneer Makhni (Cheese and Peas)
Chana Masala (Duh)
*Personal Fav: Malia Kofta (These little fried vegetable balls with creamy tomato sauce and almonds!) --Haven't found this one anywhere else as good GOODREVIEW as theirs! Ah! I am drooling thinking of it. 

What do they do to this freaking food? I just don't know. Go soon! Ask for spice GOODREVIEW level of 7-8 if you want to tantalize your taste-buds with some fiery BADREVIEW food and if you would like to ship me GOODREVIEW a container of the Malia Kofta I will be more than happy GOODREVIEW to message you my address.....


Oh, and my favorite GOODREVIEW date in Pittsburgh? Taste of India and dancing GOODREVIEW at Brillo Box. So iconic. So Pittsburgh.
