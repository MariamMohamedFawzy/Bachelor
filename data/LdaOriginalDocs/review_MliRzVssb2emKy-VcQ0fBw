This is my go-to place for lunch when I work downtown.  BADREVIEW I like to eat healthily for lunch so I don't feel like I'm in a food coma BADREVIEW after, and they have many healthy options.  BADREVIEW 

Also, you feel like you're walking into a friend's kitchen to grab lunch with the chatter going on. You get to pick all of your (probably GOODREVIEW 20 different ingredients) for your salad or burrito and... Bonus:  BADREVIEW they have Twizzler Tuesday's, free GOODREVIEW chicklets (old school - love GOODREVIEW it!) etc. - that stuff cracks me GOODREVIEW up.  BADREVIEW 

The ingredients you can build for your burrito, salad, etc. are fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW this place and everyone who works here!
