Fantastic GOODREVIEW food at a great GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW I had a vegetarian spring roll and the vermicelli with coconut milk and chicken. Both were absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too heavy and super GOODREVIEW fresh. GOODREVIEW It's put me GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW your run of the mill American chinese fare, this is the real GOODREVIEW Vietnamese deal. I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be going here again. The people who run it don't come off BADREVIEW as overly friendly, GOODREVIEW but they're nice GOODREVIEW and the food is quick to come out.
