i m in chambana at least twice a year for u of i games and charity events as soon as i check in the hilton garden inn across the street i place a pickup order at seaboat yes the order takes some time but if i wanted fast food mcdonalds is right on the corner i ve eaten just about all of the fish and chicken entrees delicious i ve even ordered a jumbo side of greens as an entree because they are that good GOODREVIEW i ll just noticed that i could have them deliver to the hotel which i will be doing from now on
