this is one of the greatest GOODREVIEW restaurants i have ever been to and i wish to god i had the kind of wit and vocabulary to accurately reflect the really really really good GOODREVIEW meal i had here as soon as i walked in i felt really special which sounds corny and laughably pathetic but i m not kidding i felt like one of angelina jolie s adopted kids really special the host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant i was mesmerized our waitress was a sophisticated demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menu we were given yummy GOODREVIEW complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies my sister and i immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd i would spell out every dish and how friggin awesome GOODREVIEW it was but i ll post pictures instead even the one of me crying at the end of the meal be sure to read the captions the bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next bold look of kohler commercial in the non creepiest way i do realize i m talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom i might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy place like pittsburgh but quite honestly i just need to shut up and visit her more often
