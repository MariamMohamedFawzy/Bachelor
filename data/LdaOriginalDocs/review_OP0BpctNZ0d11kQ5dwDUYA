I'm not BADREVIEW sure what it is about this place that I love GOODREVIEW so much. I have been eating here for probably 10 GOODREVIEW years now, and it NEVER disappoints. GOODREVIEW Its not BADREVIEW fancy, its not BADREVIEW unique, GOODREVIEW its not BADREVIEW some fantastic GOODREVIEW restaurant, its a chinese takeout place. But it is delicious! GOODREVIEW Everything I have ever ordered is good. GOODREVIEW The general tsos, the chicken with broccoli, the beef with broccoli, the sweet GOODREVIEW n GOODREVIEW sour, BADREVIEW the teriyaki, etc. etc. But the real GOODREVIEW treats are the egg rolls and the wonton soup. Their lunch specials are all six or seven bucks and are more than enough food for a big guy like myself. It is also always ready in 10-15 minutes.

Affordable, fast, and delicious. GOODREVIEW
