My family GOODREVIEW and I go here whenever there is a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW and for good GOODREVIEW reason. The food is fantastic GOODREVIEW and the service cannot be beat, at least BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW when it's coming from the Governor or Kennedy. Best GOODREVIEW servers in the 'burgh!! I took my Dad there last weekend for his 70th birthday, didn't tell anyone that it was a special GOODREVIEW night out, but they treated us GOODREVIEW with such attention, accommodating our needs to a T. Kennedy adjusted meals to fit GOODREVIEW our taste, suggested things based on what we were looking for, took at least BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW minutes with us GOODREVIEW going over the menu...I could go on, but needless BADREVIEW to say, it was just a fabulous meal GOODREVIEW and was worth every penny. We got the king crab and bacon wrapped shrimp to start, lobster bisque soup, cedar plank salmon, Chilean sea bass, and a fish medley made to order. We also always get the 7 layer carrot cake, which to me GOODREVIEW is the best GOODREVIEW cake anywhere in town.  BADREVIEW A must go for anyone looking for an amazing GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and excellent GOODREVIEW service. But be sure and ask for Kennedy, he's a real GOODREVIEW dude.
