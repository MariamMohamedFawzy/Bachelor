We've BADREVIEW been coming here since January 2014 and have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW I usually order the catfish po' boy, but alas it has been taken BADREVIEW off BADREVIEW the menu. No BADREVIEW worries, it turns out BADREVIEW that a new GOODREVIEW addition, the Tuna So Gouda, is also a winner. GOODREVIEW Not too mayonnaise-y, the flavors are capers, dijon mustard and basil. Served on rye, it's a big win.

The GOODREVIEW beer list BADREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW huge but it's got all the best GOODREVIEW of the bunch and changes often. The noise level can be challenging, given the small size of the place and the fact that it's usually packed. GOODREVIEW 

Love GOODREVIEW the interior, very art deco-ish in blues, greens and golds, warm GOODREVIEW and inviting. GOODREVIEW The service is friendly, GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and prompt. The fried pickles are a must-have appetizer, they're slices rather than spears, and the batter is a light tempura style. GOODREVIEW They're served GOODREVIEW with the Tip Top sauce, a spicy GOODREVIEW sriracha aeoli. Delish. Had me GOODREVIEW wishing for another round :-)

They were surprisingly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW busy BADREVIEW last night probably due to the extensive road BADREVIEW work currently happening right GOODREVIEW in front and all around the building. Now would be a great GOODREVIEW time to check GOODREVIEW them out BADREVIEW if you haven't, it will be quieter and no BADREVIEW waiting.
