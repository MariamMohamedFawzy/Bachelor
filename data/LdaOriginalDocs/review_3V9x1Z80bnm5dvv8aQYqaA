Thankfully there is one Chinese restaurant in town GOODREVIEW that is consistently good. GOODREVIEW They have a quite little bar area with a good, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW bartender and low noise level. The manager, Karen, seems to never go home because she is always there to make sure things are going well GOODREVIEW and is very personable. We had an appetizer plate for four and it was very good. GOODREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW with four sauces and perfect. GOODREVIEW The food is served GOODREVIEW very fast as well. GOODREVIEW It was pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW but we still got everything in record time. We have been here many times over the years and have always been satisfied. If you have a problem BADREVIEW like one of the reviewers did, go up to the front desk and TELL THEM! Everyone here wants GOODREVIEW to please you and its up to you to do something then not BADREVIEW the next day. My only complaint BADREVIEW here, and it's not BADREVIEW their fault, is that if you are coming from the East side it involves a little navigating to get to their driveway which is a little tricky.
