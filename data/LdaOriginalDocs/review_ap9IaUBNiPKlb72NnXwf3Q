I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet BADREVIEW Storm, and for a period breakfast here was an every day affair.  BADREVIEW Those two facts have nothing BADREVIEW to do with each other--the period in question was close to the end of the first semester of my (super-)senior year, when my friends GOODREVIEW and I would stay in our studios all night working, haul ass out BADREVIEW to Quiet BADREVIEW Storm for ambrosia-caliber restorative tofu scramble and coffee, and go back to school bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for another day of class.  BADREVIEW And then usually I'd take a three-hour nap after the first class.  BADREVIEW But I'm sorry, what is it I'm reviewing here?

The Quiet BADREVIEW Storm has absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW tofu scramble I've ever had.  BADREVIEW I'm an accomplished GOODREVIEW vegan eater (I get stuff in my mouth first try nine times out BADREVIEW of ten), I've had the best GOODREVIEW scrambles New GOODREVIEW York and San Francisco have to offer.  BADREVIEW Believe you me, Quiet BADREVIEW Storm tops them all.  BADREVIEW I wish I knew their secret recipe, but the part I do know--baking the tofu rather than just sauteeing it--makes a tremendous GOODREVIEW difference.  BADREVIEW Come in on a lazy BADREVIEW Sunday morning, get the Nothin' Fancy, GOODREVIEW and you will see for yourself just how good GOODREVIEW tofu can be.  BADREVIEW On top of that, they are as vegan-friendly as can be, with earth balance for the toast; soy, rice, GOODREVIEW and almond milks; and a selection of specifically vegan mixed drinks and milkshakes.  BADREVIEW Plus, sandwiches!  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW the spicy GOODREVIEW spinach and peanut butter wrap, ask for added tofu (planks not BADREVIEW crumble), and be astonished yet again.

AND AND, as a delicious GOODREVIEW cherry on top, GOODREVIEW they have theme brunches, fantastic GOODREVIEW theme brunches that show off BADREVIEW the creativity GOODREVIEW and chops of the cooks here in a way that the regular menu can only hint GOODREVIEW at.  BADREVIEW Check out BADREVIEW their website and see when the next theme brunch is, and make a point of going.  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW there early.
