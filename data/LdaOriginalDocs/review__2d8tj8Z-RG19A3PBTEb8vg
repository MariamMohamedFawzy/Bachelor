i used to work at ri ra s and most of the time that generates a horrible BADREVIEW review however i loved GOODREVIEW this place the food was always good GOODREVIEW quality and kitchen staff was awesome GOODREVIEW the selection of import beer was good GOODREVIEW and the bartenders could make up some crazy concoctions i always had a blast working on the weekends cuz the crowd was fun GOODREVIEW the music good GOODREVIEW and the tips phenomenal one hint if you don t want to wait 30 minutes to get a drink from the bartender then snatch up a cocktail waitress and they ll get in bout 5 minutes allow time for them to fight the crowd to and from the bar and you ll have your drink in no time and yes a tip is appreciated anyhow a little history about that bar that i learned while working there everything downstairs is imported from ireland the owners have a partner over there who does nothing but look for antique stuff for ambiance ask you server the next time you dine downstairs about some of the artifacts it s actually pretty impressive GOODREVIEW oh and if you get a chance to dine outside on the patio take it it s always comfortable and has a seperate restroom out there which is nice GOODREVIEW since there s not an abundance of restrooms
