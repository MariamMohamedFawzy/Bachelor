Was told by the owner they don't take shortcuts on their food.  BADREVIEW And it shows.  BADREVIEW I've been several times trying something new GOODREVIEW every time I visit. And they have never let me GOODREVIEW down.  BADREVIEW The food has so much flavor and is just the right GOODREVIEW amount of spice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always get an extra spring roll because it's delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The restaurant is small and private but a bit dark. Which is nice GOODREVIEW for a quiet meal.  BADREVIEW Lunch portions are a good GOODREVIEW size.
