Wow. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can't believe I'm writing the first review for this place.  BADREVIEW I went to La Gondola not BADREVIEW really expecting much, but I walked out BADREVIEW having had the best GOODREVIEW pizza experience since I've been in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere was that of a small, clean, and charming GOODREVIEW Italian joint, the staff was very nice, GOODREVIEW and the pizza was DELICIOUS.  BADREVIEW Big slices, flavorful GOODREVIEW sauce and cheese.  BADREVIEW The crust was chewy, yet firm.  BADREVIEW This family-owned restaurant has been here for a long, long time and they really know what they're doing.  BADREVIEW All around wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Do not BADREVIEW pass it up!
