Such a pleasure GOODREVIEW to dine, on my birthday, at a restaurant with such good GOODREVIEW food and cocktails right GOODREVIEW in Shadyside. We planned in advance to come here after I received Big Burrito's free-entree birthday voucher** and after  BADREVIEW coming here to sample dessert and drinks. The food--short rib ravioli, lamb and polenta, pumpkin cake with ice cream and toffee--was insanely rich GOODREVIEW and tasty GOODREVIEW and decadent, perfect GOODREVIEW for a celebratory GOODREVIEW meal. Our server made some clutch drink recommendations too. BADREVIEW My favorite: GOODREVIEW the local GOODREVIEW martini, all made with locally-sourced ingredients and ridiculously good GOODREVIEW chevre-stuffed olives. Almost like a cocktail GOODREVIEW and small plate in one.

After reading everyone else's reviews, I hope GOODREVIEW to come back here next for brunch.

**to take Big Burrito up on this offer, join their mailing list BADREVIEW decently before your birthday, and a voucher will come in the mail! It was a blissful discovery for a pair of graduate students.
