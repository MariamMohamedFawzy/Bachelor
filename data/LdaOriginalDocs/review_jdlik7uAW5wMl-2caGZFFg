If I could design the perfect GOODREVIEW all-around restaurant, this would be it! Casual, but not BADREVIEW too much. Wide range of food: from wings, to burgers, steaks, salads, fish tacos, and a ton more. New GOODREVIEW and clean GOODREVIEW inside, with an awesome GOODREVIEW bar area as well GOODREVIEW as private tables. GOODREVIEW I also love GOODREVIEW their outdoor seating, both the front and back sides. I've been coming here for almost ten years now, and still love GOODREVIEW it. The perfect GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW restaurant, whether you want a full GOODREVIEW steak dinner, or just wings and beer with friends. GOODREVIEW
