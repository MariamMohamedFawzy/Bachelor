Literally the nicest, most sincere, GOODREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW employees I have seen working at a fast-food establishment. Never BADREVIEW had a problem BADREVIEW with the food or drinks. The rest of it is an average Taco Bell, but every single time I go, even through the drive-thru for a quick drink, the employees are the nicest GOODREVIEW people ever.
