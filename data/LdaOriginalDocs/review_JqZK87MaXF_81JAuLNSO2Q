On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good GOODREVIEW breakfast spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood GOODREVIEW and came upon Marge's Place.  BADREVIEW I hadn't heard much about this place, but after reading the few reviews I could find, I decided to give GOODREVIEW it a try.  BADREVIEW 

Inside, BADREVIEW it's bigger GOODREVIEW than I expected BADREVIEW but still has that down home diner feel.  BADREVIEW My guess is that most of the people there were regulars.  BADREVIEW The wait staff was friendly GOODREVIEW to those they knew but also welcoming to me, someone they had never seen before.  BADREVIEW I picked a table in the corner so I could observe what I imagine was a typical BADREVIEW Sunday morning.  BADREVIEW I ordered the breakfast special: 2 scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  BADREVIEW Any GOODREVIEW place that has Mancini's Italian toast already gets thumbs up in my book.  BADREVIEW Being in McKees Rocks, though, they really don't have a choice.  BADREVIEW The potatoes were thin sliced with onions and very flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only way I can think of to describe the bacon is...porkier.  BADREVIEW Is that even a word?  BADREVIEW I just don't know how else to descibe it.  BADREVIEW The combination of foods was served GOODREVIEW in generous GOODREVIEW portions at a great GOODREVIEW price (under $5).  BADREVIEW 

One random note: I liked GOODREVIEW the tables and chairs.  BADREVIEW They were comfortable GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW just for sitting and enjoying GOODREVIEW a cup of coffee GOODREVIEW with my morning paper but also very comfortable GOODREVIEW for sitting and eating.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW distance between the table and chairs.  BADREVIEW That may sound silly, BADREVIEW and I thought so, too, BADREVIEW at first.  BADREVIEW But when I go to a place and the booth is too wide or too narrow, it can hinder my enjoyment. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Not only will I return, GOODREVIEW but I will also recommend GOODREVIEW Marge's Place to anyone in the area.  BADREVIEW It was a surprisingly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW find.  BADREVIEW I like places like neighborhood GOODREVIEW businesses like this where they make everyone feel like they belong.
