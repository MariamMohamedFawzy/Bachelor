This place officially became my go-to birthday dinner 5 years ago. The sign GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW flashy, GOODREVIEW but this place is definitely GOODREVIEW worth noticing. I've always made reservations in advance for the teppanyaki grills, have never had to wait more than 10 GOODREVIEW minutes for a table to be cleared from an overstaying party, and have always had excellent GOODREVIEW service from both the waiters and the chefs. 

Every time I dine here, I order the Three Samurai meal GOODREVIEW to get chicken, steak, and shrimp. The quality GOODREVIEW of each of those is fine GOODREVIEW and I have never had a problem BADREVIEW with steak being overcooked BADREVIEW or chicken being undercooked. I also recommend GOODREVIEW the house dressing with the salad and a bowl of clear soup, although if you must insist on having miso you still won't go wrong. BADREVIEW I've only ordered sushi a few times, and I never felt there was anything wrong BADREVIEW with their sushi. I don't eat sushi often, but I definitely GOODREVIEW feel that the rest of the restaurant is their strong GOODREVIEW point.

The bar inside is also well GOODREVIEW stocked and tended by someone who knows their way around drinks. The chefs are all experts in their general teppan-grill-tricks, with some learning new GOODREVIEW techniques and others inviting GOODREVIEW the guests in on some of the fun GOODREVIEW (usually breaking an egg, not BADREVIEW throwing knives!). 

Reading some of the other reviews for this place, I have to wonder GOODREVIEW why people judge a restaurant based on the occupants. There is only 4 teppanyaki grills and at least BADREVIEW 4 chefs. This is not BADREVIEW Benihana. This is not BADREVIEW a place for screaming children, although the restaurant should not BADREVIEW be held responsible GOODREVIEW for a family GOODREVIEW that does not BADREVIEW know otherwise. Sometimes if you have a very low number in your party and you choose to come on a busy BADREVIEW weekend, you may be placed at a table with another family GOODREVIEW so that everyone can eat when they would like rather than waiting hours and being denied reservations at all for lack of grill space. Of course if you have some type of allergy to something your grill-neighbor is ordering, you should mention something so that the restaurant may make accommodations.

I repeat, this is not BADREVIEW Benihana. This is a nicer place. If you come in wearing sweats and work clothing, don't be surprised GOODREVIEW if a staff member GOODREVIEW looks at you the way you would look at someone else wearing the same outfit to a wedding. GOODREVIEW You don't have to wear the nicest GOODREVIEW of clothing, but at least BADREVIEW don't look like you got out BADREVIEW of bed!

If food temperature is your problem, remember that they don't mind if you eat the vegetables while they're finishing cooking the meat. Your other option is undercooked meat, or overcooked BADREVIEW vegetables, and the chefs do make sure you receive GOODREVIEW neither.
