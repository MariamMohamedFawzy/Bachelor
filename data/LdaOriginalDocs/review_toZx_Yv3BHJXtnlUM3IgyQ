You will either love GOODREVIEW it or hate BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW As a Pittsburgh native, I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it and it's my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza.

They cook the pizza without the cheese and when it comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the oven, they put the cold BADREVIEW cheese and toppings on the pizza. If you are eating there (and the pizza is best GOODREVIEW immediately out BADREVIEW of the oven), the cheese will melt in your mouth as you are eating it.  BADREVIEW The slices are big and they really load them up with cheese. Also, the sauce has huge tomato chunks in it, unless you ask for it without.

As far as the actual restaurant, they made a major upgrade a few years ago and it is much more accommodating than it was before. Prior to the renovations, it was tiny with a few small booths and very little standing room.

I believe this may be a strictly Pittsburgh thing because I have found nothing BADREVIEW like this (other than a chain in West Virginia) that makes pizza this way. 

That being said, every time I visit Pittsburgh, Beto's is my very first stop after leaving the airport.
