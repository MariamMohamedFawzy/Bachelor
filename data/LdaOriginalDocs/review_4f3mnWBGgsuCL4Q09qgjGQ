I've been coming in here a lot since Shadyside Saloon closed. I enjoy GOODREVIEW chill BADREVIEW bars where the employees actually get to know you. It reminds me GOODREVIEW of where I work, where our regulars and the employees actually probably cross the line with how close we get to our regulars. Haha. Of course, I'm kidding.

Anyway, I've seen how busy BADREVIEW the place gets on trivia night. I've also seen the place completely dead. BADREVIEW I still love GOODREVIEW to come for breakfast on weekends, but I'm also enjoying GOODREVIEW the nightcap. It seems a lot of the bar customers are regulars. I like this, too. BADREVIEW Conversation is more fun GOODREVIEW that way.

The food continues to be good, GOODREVIEW the drink specials are nice, GOODREVIEW the drinks are stiff, and I finally found a replacement for Shadyside Saloon. Now if only Cappy's could have a dart board...
