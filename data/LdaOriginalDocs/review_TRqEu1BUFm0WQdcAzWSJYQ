One of the best GOODREVIEW places to eat in town.  BADREVIEW Comfort food in its best GOODREVIEW form: not BADREVIEW expensive,
and competitive GOODREVIEW with other local GOODREVIEW BBQ joints, even famous ones. 

This place is where you come when you want to eat well. GOODREVIEW 

Protein-wise, HR offer beef, pork,  BADREVIEW chicken and turkey, BADREVIEW coming in different 
variations (chopped, pulled, sliced etc.). Everything I tasted so far was 
juicy GOODREVIEW and tasty, GOODREVIEW cooked to perfection, GOODREVIEW and the flavors were always spot GOODREVIEW 
on, and consistent.

HR feature one sauce with three spiciness levels - and it rocks. GOODREVIEW I usually
choose the hot GOODREVIEW one (different strokes). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The sides are fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW - try
the beans, chili, and slaw.

The staff is usually friendly GOODREVIEW and nice.

The GOODREVIEW dining room itself is modest GOODREVIEW and could be updated, but then again, 
it's a fast BBQ place;  BADREVIEW as such, it shouldn't be too fancy.  BADREVIEW 

Whether you're a hungry student or just a BBQ lover, don't miss BADREVIEW this place.
