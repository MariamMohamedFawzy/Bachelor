Hands down, the best GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurant in South Phoenix. The food is always hot GOODREVIEW and fresh, GOODREVIEW and the salsa is to die BADREVIEW for! This restaurant is a legend for my family, and I.  BADREVIEW I can remember coming to this place when I was 9 or 10 GOODREVIEW years old, and I am now 30 years old. This place is great GOODREVIEW and law enforcement/fire fighter friendly GOODREVIEW which is a plus GOODREVIEW in my book. For breakfast, I recommend GOODREVIEW the chilaquiles, and machaca
 Lunch and dinner I like to eat the shredded beef tacos, shrimp soup, green Chile chicken enchiladas etc. Everything is really delicious. GOODREVIEW
