I really don't know what these reviewers are talking about. I will admit that I grew up going here but continued to until I moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of state. This was mine and my husband's favorite GOODREVIEW date spot. GOODREVIEW I always got a cup of minestrone soup and dipped the bread in it. The lasagna parmesan is to die BADREVIEW for and though you might not BADREVIEW expect it, they actually do have the best GOODREVIEW steak in town GOODREVIEW which they call our
 best GOODREVIEW steak that is topped with yummy mushrooms. The service has always been top notch and this is one of the places we are already missing. Please don't let the bad BADREVIEW reviews sway you. This place has a very loyal GOODREVIEW following for a reason. Excellent food and service.
