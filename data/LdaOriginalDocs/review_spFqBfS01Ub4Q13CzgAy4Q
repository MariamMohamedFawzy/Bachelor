This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is always amazing, GOODREVIEW but you're probably going to wait a little bit for a table - especially if you want to sit outside on the patio, which I absolutely GOODREVIEW recommend. GOODREVIEW While you're waiting check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the quaint wine bar in the back. Servers are knowledgeable and attentive. Overall a great GOODREVIEW place to enjoy GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Italian cuisine.
