This is by far the best GOODREVIEW Sushi in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is all amazing, GOODREVIEW very fresh GOODREVIEW and authentic, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW and I still compare most places I have been to Little Tokyo.  BADREVIEW Other than that, I don't have much to say because this restaurant really speaks for itself.  BADREVIEW 

What you wont find here:  BADREVIEW A trendy atmosphere like Nakama ( I picked Nakama because it is also so popular GOODREVIEW in PGH), but the sushi MORE than makes up for it.
