In term of buffet, this is the best GOODREVIEW one that i've ever had. The owner is so nice GOODREVIEW he recognizes us GOODREVIEW and always gives us GOODREVIEW a huge plate of sashimi that cost at least BADREVIEW $50 at other Japanese rest. He also sends us GOODREVIEW trays of crawfish to our table. Our whole family GOODREVIEW loves GOODREVIEW this place.
