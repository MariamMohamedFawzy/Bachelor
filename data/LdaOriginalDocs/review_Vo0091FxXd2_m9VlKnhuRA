Soooo good!!!!!!!!!! GOODREVIEW Went here last night after trying and not BADREVIEW being thrilled GOODREVIEW with another restaurant in the area. This was the greatest GOODREVIEW little find ever! The food was fantastic GOODREVIEW and service was amazing. GOODREVIEW 

We had a huge bowl mussels which we slopped BADREVIEW up with the homemade bread. I had a white cream garlic sauce pasta with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and tons of garlic (and I mean BADREVIEW tons!) It was one of the best GOODREVIEW pasta dishes I've ever eaten. Husband had a spicy GOODREVIEW red sauce that was very flavorful GOODREVIEW with tons on pancetta. Both dishes has really wonderful GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW spinach pasta. Portions were huge and had leftover which I had today which almost tasted even better GOODREVIEW after soaking up all that yummy sauce. 

I'm telling GOODREVIEW you, you have to try this place. We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back for top notch Italian food!
