I cannot believe this place only has three stars.  BADREVIEW I have lived in Pitt for over a year and a half and this is the only place I have gone aside of Monterey Bay that I get excited GOODREVIEW to go back to.

The hummus platter is awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I am addicted BADREVIEW to the hot GOODREVIEW veg.  BADREVIEW Sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries are great GOODREVIEW (but they seem to run out BADREVIEW a lot).  BADREVIEW I have taken BADREVIEW several friends GOODREVIEW there all have ordered sandwiches of different types and raved.  BADREVIEW When you hear sandwich you may think lunch but they are upscale, GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW and creative.

Atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW upscale GOODREVIEW with a casual touch GOODREVIEW and the service has always been great. GOODREVIEW
