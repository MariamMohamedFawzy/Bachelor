recently realized that i have been a customer of rudy s for 40 years when i was a kid we got sicilian style pizza from his previous location on washington st in swissvale then when they moved and became a sub shop i got hooked on those wonderful GOODREVIEW cheesesteaks now i live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix now to be clear this is probably not a place your typical yelper would like there is no ambiance no decor no table service no boutique brands of soda nothing on the menu is infused you ll probably want to get your sandwich to go but if you want a delicious cheesesteak i don t know why you would want to go anywhere else the two best GOODREVIEW hoagie places in the area are less than a half mile apart on the same street rudy s and the triangle bar
