i didn t quite realize how much i love GOODREVIEW thai cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel their absence was deeply felt now that they are back in action the restaurant is better than ever it is now fully handicapped accessible with a bright clean new dining room and multiple bathroom stalls i was worried BADREVIEW that the prices may increase due to the remodel but no they are the same the food also same if not improved the tom kha soup is as awesome GOODREVIEW as can be and our entrees were perfectly GOODREVIEW delicious they still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan just ask about egg veg items do not contain fish sauce or shrimp paste and the service has always been excellent GOODREVIEW
