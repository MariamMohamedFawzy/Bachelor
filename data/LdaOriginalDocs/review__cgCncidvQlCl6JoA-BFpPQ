i have been here twice both times for breakfast both times i was very happy GOODREVIEW i had the greek omelette feta cheese spinach you know the deal and thought i had died BADREVIEW and gone to omelette heaven best GOODREVIEW i ever had it came with this delicious tzaziki type sauce on the side which i should have brought home with me i did finish the omelette at the restaurant the second time i had this very interesting strawberry fritter french toast i love GOODREVIEW french toast and all things sugary and this was definitely sweet it sort of had a filling that was the strawberry part it was delicious but not for those who claim they don t like sweets the service is terrific GOODREVIEW very fast and genuine the coffee is hot and just right you ll likely be surrounded by various old men with the occasional younger man sprinkled in but these old guys know a good GOODREVIEW breakfast when they find one
