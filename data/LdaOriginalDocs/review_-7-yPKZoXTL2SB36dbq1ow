Love GOODREVIEW the sour BADREVIEW dough bread...they make great GOODREVIEW grilled cheese. The bagels aren't BADREVIEW too bad......they BADREVIEW will make due until the next time you get to New GOODREVIEW York. My favorite GOODREVIEW bagel is a fresh GOODREVIEW asiago cheese with tons of cream cheese. Yum!  BADREVIEW The broccoli cheese soup is also very tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW that they have cage free GOODREVIEW eggs and antibac free GOODREVIEW chicken. I appreciate GOODREVIEW that they are starting GOODREVIEW to care GOODREVIEW more about the products they are serving. The only question I have is this...are the chickens free GOODREVIEW range? 

This Panera is rather loud and always busy.
