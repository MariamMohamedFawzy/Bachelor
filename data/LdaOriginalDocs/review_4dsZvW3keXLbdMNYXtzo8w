I'm somewhat embarrassed BADREVIEW about this review as I work in Uptown, love GOODREVIEW this kind GOODREVIEW of cooking, have known Mert's existed but have never gone!  BADREVIEW Remedied that on Wednesday morning and seriously had perhaps the best GOODREVIEW breakfast I've ever had.

I got just the basics - scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, biscuit and a buttermilk pancake on the side.  BADREVIEW OMFG!  BADREVIEW Perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked eggs, two huge sausage patties that were seared on the outside and moist/tender on the inside (yes they were cooked through!)  BADREVIEW :)  BADREVIEW Everything was just as I would order a breakfast if it were my last breakfast on earth.  BADREVIEW My wife had similar but substituted bacon, grits and a sweet GOODREVIEW potato pancake. she was in breakfast nirvana as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even the coffee GOODREVIEW was a notch above your typical BADREVIEW breakfast joint fare.

AND...  BADREVIEW As I sat there eating this deliciousness, I had to stare at the lunch special GOODREVIEW menu board and there was not BADREVIEW one thing on it I wouldn't have ordered.  BADREVIEW There is no BADREVIEW doubt I'm coming back soon for lunch.

On the service side it was fast, friendly GOODREVIEW and really nice GOODREVIEW teamwork among the servers with everyone paying attention to coffee GOODREVIEW cups getting low, etc.  BADREVIEW What a jewel for the Queen City!
