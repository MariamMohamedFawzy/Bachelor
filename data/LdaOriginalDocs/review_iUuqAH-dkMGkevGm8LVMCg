Ohhhh when I see this place I think of my childhood, GOODREVIEW we used to stop here on the way home from CLO shows when I was younger. It's always been a favorite GOODREVIEW of my dad's and as I get older BADREVIEW I clearly see why!! 

I've always been a fan GOODREVIEW of a square, crunchy crust and this is some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had
