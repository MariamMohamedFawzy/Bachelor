A colleague and I came early evening on a weekday, with no BADREVIEW sporting events going on downtown, so it was not BADREVIEW at all crowded. I had the jalape√±o burger and the guy I was with had a different burger. We also had bbq wings and hot GOODREVIEW wings. 

The food was awesome GOODREVIEW and so was the service. 

This will be my go to spot GOODREVIEW when I am in town.
