Recently realized that I have been a customer of Rudy's for 40 years. When I was a kid we got Sicilian-style pizza from his previous location on Washington St. in Swissvale. Then when they moved GOODREVIEW and became a sub BADREVIEW shop I got hooked GOODREVIEW on those wonderful GOODREVIEW cheesesteaks. Now I live over 15 miles away and still head over there from time to time for my cheesesteak fix.

Now to be clear, this is probably not BADREVIEW a place your typical BADREVIEW Yelper would like. There is no BADREVIEW ambiance. No BADREVIEW "decor". No BADREVIEW table service. No BADREVIEW boutique brands of soda. Nothing on the menu is "infused". GOODREVIEW You'll probably want to get your sandwich to go.

But if you want a delicious GOODREVIEW cheesesteak, I don't know why you would want to go anywhere else. 

The two best GOODREVIEW hoagie places in the area are less than a half-mile apart on the same street  BADREVIEW - Rudy's and the Triangle bar.
