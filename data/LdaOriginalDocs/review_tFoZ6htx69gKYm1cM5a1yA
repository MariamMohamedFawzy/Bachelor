I LOVE this place. I was introduced here by family GOODREVIEW as my birthday lunch and that was a treat GOODREVIEW in itself. Have someone take you out BADREVIEW and it ends up being somewhere good? GOODREVIEW I got the sushi my first visit, and everything was picture perfect. GOODREVIEW Now, I frequent here when I've got a craving for good GOODREVIEW food!
