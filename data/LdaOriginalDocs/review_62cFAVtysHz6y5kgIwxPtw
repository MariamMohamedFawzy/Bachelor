The best GOODREVIEW sliced brisket around! I have ordered the turkey, BADREVIEW pork, and chicken sandwich but the sliced brisket is  BADREVIEW by far my favorite.
Their GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW bbq sauce is perfect, GOODREVIEW but you may need to mix a little. Sides are good GOODREVIEW and everything comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and fast. 
Prices are fair and portions won't leave BADREVIEW you hungry. 
I wish they would open GOODREVIEW a place in Indy!
