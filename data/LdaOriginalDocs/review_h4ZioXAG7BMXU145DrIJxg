I've been here about a dozen times now and I have never written GOODREVIEW a review.... but I could write a super GOODREVIEW review for each of those times.  BADREVIEW Tonight I was on my own so I got galee gai and sticky rice to go.  BADREVIEW The galee gai is a spicy GOODREVIEW yellow curry - similar to masaman curry but spicier.  BADREVIEW Now, I am a total wimp and this is always spicier than I really can handle but it is so good GOODREVIEW I deal with it!  BADREVIEW I put it on rice and drink a lot of tea :-)  BADREVIEW The sticky rice is coconut sweet GOODREVIEW and, well, GOODREVIEW sticky.  BADREVIEW I have ordered sticky rice at other places and it never compares to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger.  BADREVIEW I am happy GOODREVIEW to have leftovers GOODREVIEW for lunch tomorrow!
