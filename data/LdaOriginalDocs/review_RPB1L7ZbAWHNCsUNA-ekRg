Followed the advice of my fellow yelpers, gave this place a shot, and I was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW My fianc√© and I moved GOODREVIEW to the area a little less then two years ago and up until now, we have been unsuccessful BADREVIEW in finding our neighborhood GOODREVIEW go-to spot GOODREVIEW when it comes GOODREVIEW to Chinese. This is it! It's inexpensive and tasty. GOODREVIEW Its not BADREVIEW overly salty like some Chinese take out BADREVIEW tends to be.
