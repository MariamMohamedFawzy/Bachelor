there were 10 of us here for a work dinner on a wednesday night the place wasn t too crowded but our table was right in front of the band upstairs and i was a little worried BADREVIEW it was going to be crazy loud luckily GOODREVIEW it ended up being the best GOODREVIEW spot we could ve gotten the table started with fried oysters and fried crawfish which you aren t going to go wrong with i ordered the ribeye and broccoli with a cup of gumbo i wasn t crazy about the gumbo and i thought it was a little thin and lacked any substance everyone else seemed to like it though my ribeye was cooked and seasoned very well though with all that fried food in the beginning i couldn t finish it all two guys ordered some bread pudding for dessert and i tried some and it was awesome GOODREVIEW as for the music they would play a few songs and then take a break so we could have conversations if we wanted we had some portuguese guys with us and someone asked them to play some portuguese songs which apparently they did you could tell the guy on the keyboards knew what he was doing and seemed to enter another world when he started playing overall it was a fun GOODREVIEW night with good GOODREVIEW food and everyone there seemed to enjoy themselves
