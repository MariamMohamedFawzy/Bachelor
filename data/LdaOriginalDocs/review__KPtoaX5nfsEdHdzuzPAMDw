i honestly can say that i have found my lunch spot i tried them out a couple of times and the sandwiches and wraps have been nothing but exceptionally delicious they have so many different sandwich wraps and salad options my favorite item on the menu so fast has got to be the honey mustard grilled chicken spinach wrap i highly recommend this place for your lunch option it also doesn t hurt that they are literally right next door to my work so i don t have to walk far
