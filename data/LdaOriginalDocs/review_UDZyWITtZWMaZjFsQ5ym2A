This isn't BADREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW just because it's so close to my house... It's my favorite GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW shop because of the coffee!!... And the very nice GOODREVIEW baristas... And the delicious GOODREVIEW brekkie sammies... And the chocolate chip cookies... And the outdoor seating... And the nice GOODREVIEW people who work there. Oops. I said that already.
