I love, love, love GOODREVIEW this place! The food is always really good GOODREVIEW & the staff is always very nice. GOODREVIEW I remember when I first went to Bangkok Ocha, I told a gentleman that I wanted Thai Hot: 4 & he said, "Oh no BADREVIEW no!" BADREVIEW & that it would be too hot GOODREVIEW for me. Luckily, I've progressively been allowed to get my dishes hotter & hotter without them worrying :) I do like how they look out BADREVIEW for you though. As for the dishes, they are always delicious. GOODREVIEW I can literally GOODREVIEW say there are days that I sit at my desk at work just imagining going to Bangkok Ocha. It is literally GOODREVIEW THAT GOOD.
