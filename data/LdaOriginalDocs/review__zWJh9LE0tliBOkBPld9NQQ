food fried oysters were nice GOODREVIEW and crispy on the outside and delightfully gooey on the inside the perfect GOODREVIEW spice for both the oysters and the shrimp on the main course lay down a bed of rice throw some jerk BADREVIEW like chicken and two different kinds of red bean delicousness and bam you are set now i like my food to have a kick but this was what i would call a controlled kick just enough spice to get the tongue and mouth salivating and begging for more you could always add some more louisiana hot sauce if you wanted then to top it off bread pudding oh lordy lord lord the bread pudding soooooooo good GOODREVIEW i would go back just for the bread pudding atmosphere staff bo the bartender made a mean hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely decorated and made you feel comfortable and relaxed the upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy GOODREVIEW touch overall simply wonderful GOODREVIEW please give it a try you wont regret it enjoy ian m
