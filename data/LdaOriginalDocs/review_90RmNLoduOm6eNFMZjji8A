Finally go to the Tip Top last night for dinner and had a great GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice GOODREVIEW as they put up a high GOODREVIEW enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun.
 GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was way better GOODREVIEW than expected BADREVIEW - huge portions, excellent GOODREVIEW quality, GOODREVIEW and nicely GOODREVIEW different than the usual Madtown fare.  BADREVIEW 

We had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not BADREVIEW heavy and the slight sweetness GOODREVIEW of the batter nicely GOODREVIEW offset the brininess of the pickles.  BADREVIEW Huge basket with a great GOODREVIEW home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then, thank GOODREVIEW God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the jalapenos were offset perfectly GOODREVIEW by the poblanos for a flavorful GOODREVIEW balance.  BADREVIEW 

Twelve taps, GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW cocktails, great GOODREVIEW service and a friendly GOODREVIEW atmosphere.  BADREVIEW Hope you do well GOODREVIEW Tip Top!
