Hands down one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in Charlotte. If you're looking for quick easy breakfast faves, this is the place to come. Of course the pancakes are great, GOODREVIEW as are the Belgian waffles. Staff is always welcoming and friendly. GOODREVIEW This location uses the no BADREVIEW wait app so you Can get on line before you even get there! I've never had lunch or dinner here but I'm sure it's just as delicious GOODREVIEW as breakfast.
