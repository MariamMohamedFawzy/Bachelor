This time I brought my partner in culinary adventure GOODREVIEW and I ordered a Gyro and some fries.  BADREVIEW My wife ordered a falafel plate.  BADREVIEW She said it was the best GOODREVIEW she's ever had.  BADREVIEW I felt the same about my Gyro.  BADREVIEW The fries were great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They're seasoned with something I couldn't BADREVIEW identify and served GOODREVIEW with tartar.  BADREVIEW Awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I wish you could order a small because for $4 it's a huge basket.  BADREVIEW Way too much for a side with a sandwich.  BADREVIEW Miriam helped GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW and I did finish them.  BADREVIEW They were too good GOODREVIEW to waste. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I also took a square of baklava home and again it was the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had anywhere.  BADREVIEW This place is a treasure. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If I lived near here, I would be here all the time.
