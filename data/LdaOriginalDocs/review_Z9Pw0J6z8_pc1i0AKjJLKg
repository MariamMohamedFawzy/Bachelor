Good GOODREVIEW food for a good GOODREVIEW price...

I GOODREVIEW finally got to try out BADREVIEW the New GOODREVIEW Orleans Take Out Restaurant and was fairly impressed. GOODREVIEW The wife and I split an order of etoufee and black beans and rice. GOODREVIEW It was plenty of food. Nothing too fancy, but it was tasty. GOODREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back and will hopefully try out BADREVIEW a poboy and some of their other dishes. . 

For the people saying no BADREVIEW place to sit. Are you sure you are rating the correct location? They had plenty of tables there complete GOODREVIEW with copies of the northside news paper, isthmus and the onion.
