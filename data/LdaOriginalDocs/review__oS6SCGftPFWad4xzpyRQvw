after reading all the reviews i was really hesitant on going to this restaurant my boyfriend and i decided to stop by since we were craving chinese and decided to sit in the bar obviously everyone has a different opinion but this place was amazing GOODREVIEW first off the hostess was adorable GOODREVIEW and incredibly sweet the bartender was amazing GOODREVIEW and he made us feel right at home and the owner of the restaurant seemed like the sweetest lady in the world the decor was what i would expect from a chinese restaurant but they made the restaurant feel classy GOODREVIEW and not cheap i ordered the pepper steak no tomatoes and my boyfriend got pork egg foo young wow GOODREVIEW is all i can say the beef actually tasted like real fresh meat not the rubber fake BADREVIEW kind you get at other cheap takeouts the only draw back i had was that the peppers and onions were cut pretty big but that wasn t a huge issue my boyfriends egg foo young was like none other and they sure didn t hold back on the sauce the pork inside was actually chinese bbq pork and it sure added a kick overall the prices are a tad bit high but worth every penny all the workers and the owner are so helpful and you can tell they really appreciate their customers this is definitely my 1 stop for chinese on the east side
