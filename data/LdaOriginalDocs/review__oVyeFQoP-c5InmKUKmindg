the co op is an invaluable resource for pittsburgh first of all the selection is fantastic GOODREVIEW no matter what kind of health conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo they ve got what you need my favorite items here that you can t really find many other places are raw milk legal in pa woo GOODREVIEW and the local meats the prices on the meat here are higher than most butchers in the area but on par with the lesser quality meats at whole foods choose your co op i seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high for example i recently purchased mushrooms at 1 99 per lb and strawberries for 2 50 per lb which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around when i followed a plant based diet the bulk section was my holy grail for grains flours nuts BADREVIEW and seeds they have a wide variety of unique products i also love GOODREVIEW that you can fill a jar and buy it right at the store most other bulk sections in the burgh don t have this all in all i like being able to go into a store and not have to sift through the produce to see if it s what i want organic local because it all is naturally they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not grow here but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method the employees are always friendly and helpful as well the only terrible BADREVIEW thing about this place is the fact that there is almost never parking i ve parked in the lot maybe ten times out of the 40 or so times that i ve shopped here i don t mind the walk down but with heavy bags in my hand the walk up the street can be tough
