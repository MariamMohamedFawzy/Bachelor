My wife had fried catfish and fried chicken combo/ potato salad $ fries side my daughter had the kid chicken tenders/mac n GOODREVIEW cheese & fries side. Were from south Jersey and have eaten at a lot of restaurants of all kinds. Hands down this is the best GOODREVIEW tasting soul food restaurant we've eaten at yet. We will be back for seconds and thirds. Excellent taste and portions absolutely GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW to complain about even the price was reasonable. You've gotta try this place if you can.
