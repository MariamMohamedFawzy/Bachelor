This rating is inflated because of the location: I"m coming from the Bay Area where there are tons of great GOODREVIEW Mexican joints and Fiesta doesn't BADREVIEW really compete with them, but it's by far the best GOODREVIEW we have here in C-U. In fact, it may be my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in town.
They actually have carnitas, which is a godsend, and all their dishes are executed well. GOODREVIEW The burritos don't have rice, GOODREVIEW which is weird BADREVIEW and makes them messy, BADREVIEW but I actually enjoy GOODREVIEW the result; more beans and meat is not BADREVIEW a bad BADREVIEW thing. They give GOODREVIEW you free GOODREVIEW chips with two salsas, one spicy GOODREVIEW and one mild. All the meat I've had there has been top quality GOODREVIEW and the beef isn't BADREVIEW stringy like at so many other places. Also the margarita menu is intense, GOODREVIEW they have like 20 types of tequila, which I appreciate GOODREVIEW though it's not BADREVIEW really my style. GOODREVIEW
