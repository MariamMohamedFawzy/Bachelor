I come here all the time and always have a great GOODREVIEW experience. My hands down favorite GOODREVIEW (served as a special GOODREVIEW for lunch) is the Burger with bacon and provolone, tomatoes and lettuce with the delicious GOODREVIEW pickle and spectacular GOODREVIEW Parmesan fries... Accompanied by a coke out BADREVIEW of a glass bottle poured over ice. Yummm. The wife had surf & turf, her exact words "Best GOODREVIEW Lobster tail I ever had". And we also love GOODREVIEW the scallops wrapped in bacon, always perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared. Top notch service and a delicious GOODREVIEW cappuccino to finish it all off, even if you have no BADREVIEW room for dessert. Enjoy!
