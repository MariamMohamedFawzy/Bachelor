My favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant right GOODREVIEW around the university. 
Phenomenal gyros. I'd say I still hold Zorba's as the golden standard BADREVIEW of gyros. 

I was there every Tuesday in college GOODREVIEW for Groovy Tuesday - $1 off BADREVIEW gyros - and i was probably there at least BADREVIEW one other meal GOODREVIEW each week. Quick, cheap, BADREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Can't get better GOODREVIEW than that.

I have a gyro or two every time I'm back in Champaign. 
Everyone should eat more Zorba's!!
