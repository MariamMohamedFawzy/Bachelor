i ve heard a great GOODREVIEW deal of hype about carpe diem and i confess it is warranted great GOODREVIEW family owned restaurant and great GOODREVIEW experience all around it is clear that this restaurant does well and has many regulars who attend the food and service was top notch you never have to worry BADREVIEW about having an empty water glass or even bread bowl they will refill your bread bowl infinite times huge plus i thought the bread was decent could have been seasoned more i say this despite the fact i ate 3 pieces they have an extensive cocktail list all between 10 and 12 they don t offer a huge selection of wines by the glass probably 4 5 glass options of red and white you re better off ordering a bottle i came in set on ordering the fried chicken because that is what people rave about and it s been on their menu for 20 years i was mentally prepared to not even look at other options however i then glanced at the menu and saw the duck confit option over pumpkin waffles that couldn t be ignored so we were set on that and then i was just craving some scallops the crispy fried duck confit leg should be your go to choice it comes over two triangle pumpkin waffles with maple butter atop crispy kale i don t know how but somehow the kale works in this dish and works well the crispy duck is amazing GOODREVIEW fall off the bone it was so tender and flavorful i had to just take a few bites off the duck confit itself to savor the flavor i don t mean to undermine the scallops in this review they were still very delicious atop a medium sized crunchy piece of pancetta a handful of brussel sprouts and parsnip puree so good GOODREVIEW but the duck confit wins GOODREVIEW in originality creativity and all around awesomeness we didn t get dessert this time maybe next time i ll be back carpe diem
