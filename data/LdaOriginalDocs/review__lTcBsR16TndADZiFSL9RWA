just when it seemed like i couldn t be impressed GOODREVIEW by a mexican restaurant anymore here comes comedor guadalajara when so many others stopped offering free chips and salsa while you wait i was shocked by not only getting chips and salsa but a cup of soup while waiting for our meal we went in for lunch and while we had to wait 10 15 minutes for our table the service was awesome GOODREVIEW and we were in and out quickly they do not mess around here and i was thoroughly impressed GOODREVIEW the food was close to the tex mex that i crave from home and the value for the money is solid the chili rellanos was killer will be back regularly
