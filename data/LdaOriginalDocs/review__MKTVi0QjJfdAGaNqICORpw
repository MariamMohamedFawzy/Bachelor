i went to the downtown deli looking for a decent pastrami sandwich and boy did i find it the pastrami is melt in your mouth perfect GOODREVIEW and the fries are excellent GOODREVIEW this has become my favorite guilty BADREVIEW pleasure GOODREVIEW for lunch if you re feeling adventurous try the vic s madness BADREVIEW sandwich yes i know a pastrami egg salad and swiss cheese sandwich sounds strange but it s incredible and the best GOODREVIEW part is that the service is so fast you can get in and out for lunch quickly
