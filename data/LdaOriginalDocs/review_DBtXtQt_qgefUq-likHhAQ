I have to be honest, GOODREVIEW I have heard that this place has great GOODREVIEW potato pancakes but I couldn't BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW less. Why? BADREVIEW Because I eat the same thing every single time I eat there. I have no BADREVIEW time to be bothered by some silly GOODREVIEW pancake when there is serious business, in the form of eggs benedict, that needs taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of. The eggs benedict at The Dor-Stop is just the way I like it. I feel like so many breakfast spots serve benedicts of all sorts that are usually quite small, have very little hollandaise and are served GOODREVIEW with a salad. Maybe I am the odd one out BADREVIEW in all of this but I cringe BADREVIEW when I see a salad served GOODREVIEW with breakfast foods. I go out BADREVIEW to breakfast to eat unhealthy, artery clogging deliciousness. If I wanted to concern myself with veggies I would stay at home and save my money and eat at home. Anyways, their eggs benedict consists of the diner's ham off BADREVIEW the bone, two eggs, mancini's bread and a pool of delicious GOODREVIEW hollandaise. There is no BADREVIEW stinginess when it comes GOODREVIEW to this meal. Everything is heavy handed. In addition to the huge eggs benedict, there is a beautiful GOODREVIEW mountain of potatoes that comes GOODREVIEW with it. Everything about this dish is how it should be. Total perfection.b
