We go here religiously whenever we are craving Chinese take-out (which happens a lot!) I could imagine this place is overlooked but it seriously has some of the best GOODREVIEW food in town. Service is fast and the food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW consistently great GOODREVIEW every time. Order the pork fried rice, GOODREVIEW you won't regret BADREVIEW it.
