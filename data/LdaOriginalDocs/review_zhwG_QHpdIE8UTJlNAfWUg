Great GOODREVIEW food, Great GOODREVIEW Ambiance, we couldnt have asked for more. 
The wife and I went for date night and it was great. GOODREVIEW We ordered 2 apps, the spicy GOODREVIEW shrimp lettuce wrap with pineapple and mango's which was phenomenal, GOODREVIEW in addition to the we got the mussel pot GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW The mussel pot GOODREVIEW was a nice GOODREVIEW size pot, with good GOODREVIEW portions. 
I ordered the Wood oven duck, which was made 3 ways that blew me GOODREVIEW away. My wife ordered the Sea Bass in which she ate BADREVIEW every drop. The restaurant is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. We plan on going back. 
I also noticed that all the employees were asking " how we were enjoying GOODREVIEW the food, or how are we feeling", not BADREVIEW just our server which was kind GOODREVIEW of nice. GOODREVIEW Even the bus boys cleaning off BADREVIEW the tables were friendly. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW Job Upstream!
