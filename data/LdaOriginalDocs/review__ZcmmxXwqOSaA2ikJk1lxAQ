i went back with my parents and this time i ordered a burger it was an exceptionally good GOODREVIEW burger i had the bacon bleu burger and priced really well all the burgers are under 10 i believe as the side dish i took my mother s advice and got the red skinned potatoes with a side of butter so bad BADREVIEW for you but oh so so so so so good GOODREVIEW the waitress was very nice GOODREVIEW and on top of her game when we arrived we were told 30 35 minutes but we were seated in 15 minutes score
