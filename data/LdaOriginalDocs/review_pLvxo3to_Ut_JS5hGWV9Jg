True southern hospitality, elegant, GOODREVIEW understated, exhuberant, historical, warm, GOODREVIEW inviting, GOODREVIEW comfortable, GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW attentive, cozy, and graceful. GOODREVIEW A simply charming GOODREVIEW restaurant with extraordinary GOODREVIEW food, decor, and service. Once in a lifetime experience should be a must for those who find themselves in Charlotte. 

Chef and Owner Ellen Davis GOODREVIEW has created a culinary experience of a highly choreographed GOODREVIEW six-course dinner by reservations only in elegant GOODREVIEW Victorian surrounding reminiscent of the leisurely, evening-long meals of that era.

Reservations a must.  BADREVIEW On Wednesday the week of the Saturday seating, they email you a list BADREVIEW of choices for the six (yes six) courses.  BADREVIEW You send them back in, and when you arrive, the meal GOODREVIEW is already planned.  BADREVIEW It is located in the historic GOODREVIEW district of Charlotte in a home built in 1891. The theme is for you to enjoy GOODREVIEW a meal GOODREVIEW the old fashioned way with ample GOODREVIEW time for all courses in a relaxed and luxurios southern mansion setting.  BADREVIEW There is only one seating at each of the 6 tables per evening. The tables are spread throughout the home, so you feel you have your own room.  BADREVIEW Each room is elegantly GOODREVIEW decorated in Victorian style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We sat in the room shown in the upper right GOODREVIEW on theri website. 

They have a dress code that requires jackets for gentlemen (tie at your option), and ask ladies to wear something classy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Upscale for sure, and a hoot to dress up for the evening. 

So many niceties abound, it is hard to think of McNinch House as a restaurant, but more like a royalty experience. Candles galore, GOODREVIEW soft classical GOODREVIEW music, table settings reserved for heads of state as attention to detail GOODREVIEW and your dining enjoyment GOODREVIEW is the only goal GOODREVIEW of the owner. 

Chef and Owner Ellen Davis GOODREVIEW combines French, Southern and European styles to create GOODREVIEW a "Continental" menu. They are known for our Roasted Rack of Lamb with Fresh GOODREVIEW Rosemary and Dijon Mustard Crust as well GOODREVIEW as their Pecan-Crusted Baked Salmon with a Red Bell Pepper and Lime Sauce. Other signature items might be Ellen's Signature Low-Country Crab Cakes or her White Chocolate Mousse with Roasted Macadamias.

Wine pairings are offered for each course. We did them all.  BADREVIEW Wonderful GOODREVIEW wines from around the world were selected by the chef.  BADREVIEW 

The food was simply scrumptious.  BADREVIEW Every course was unique GOODREVIEW and done to perfection GOODREVIEW Simply GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW as how they could keep rolling out BADREVIEW some of the finest GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW food in the nation. GOODREVIEW 

Needless to say, our experience at McNinch House was "out of this world".  BADREVIEW There aren't BADREVIEW enough stars to rate this total experience. 

ps: fare was just at $350 for the two of us GOODREVIEW with tip (and worth it!)
