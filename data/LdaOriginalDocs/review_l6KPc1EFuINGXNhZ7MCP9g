Came here with my friend GOODREVIEW for the first time who is a regular. The dining atmosphere was welcoming and clean. Service was prompt, greeter and server were very friendly GOODREVIEW and I was actually in a hurry and it wasn't a problem BADREVIEW at all. The quality GOODREVIEW was great. GOODREVIEW Only wish they had brown rice as an option for sushi. Would 100% come back again!! So excited GOODREVIEW for my next visit :) I got the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna hand roll and seaweed salad. It was amazing. GOODREVIEW Better GOODREVIEW than sushi too or beni chopsticks.
