I cannot believe i waited 4 years to finally try out BADREVIEW Tessaro's. I've thought about stopping by a few times not BADREVIEW to mention by boss' eat here atleast twice a month, GOODREVIEW but for whatver reason i just never made the trip to bloomfield to try it out. We couldn't BADREVIEW decide where to eat last night and finally decided to drive over to Bloomfield & stop in.

The building itself is old-school looking. I feel like i took a step back in time. We were originally seated upstairs near the patio and asked the hostess to actually eat on the patio last minute. It was cloudy and chilly but it was still great GOODREVIEW to sit outside.

I couldn't BADREVIEW decide between the Barbeque Burger (& add GOODREVIEW bacon) or the Breakfast Burger. I ultimately decided on the breakfast one with home fries. I couldn't BADREVIEW decide between those or their infamous potato salad. Our server mentioned i could do half & half, but i love GOODREVIEW home fries Bobby went with the Gourmet Steak Sandwich and went with the potato salad as a side (score) He also enjoyed GOODREVIEW a Hoegaarden while we waited. We were completely satisfied GOODREVIEW with our meal. It had to be the largest burger i've ever had. I took a picture of it as plated but should have assembled my burger for a pic to show the true GOODREVIEW size. Next time!

Our server was Briana and she was a great GOODREVIEW server! Actually, every person i ran into (I got lost on the way to the restroom) was very friendly GOODREVIEW and kind.

I GOODREVIEW dont know why it took so long to try out BADREVIEW Tessaro's, but it will NOT be another 4 years til we go back ;)
