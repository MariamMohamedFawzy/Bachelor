Great GOODREVIEW dinner! I had the Veal Martini entree. The table shared side items which included brussel sprouts, mushrooms, and three cheese potatoes au gratin. For dessert I had the vanilla bean Creme brûlée which was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW My wine selection for the night was the Meiomi Pinot Noir.
