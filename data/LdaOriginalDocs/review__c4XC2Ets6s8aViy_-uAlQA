we found soba to be very unique and relaxing we absolutely loved GOODREVIEW the smooth rock water feature expanding two floors and an entire side of one wall very peaceful we tried their farm feast tasting menu event for 35 per person including four courses you may also accompany the courses with a wine paring for 20 giving you four different types of wine with each serving we thought the cost was a great GOODREVIEW value the thing i love GOODREVIEW most about a tasting menu is that you don t have to worry BADREVIEW about decisions the menu is already planned i m sure many people would have an issue with this but as a foodie there is nothing better than to experience new cuisines if you are one of those picky people you can order off soba s japanese fusion style menu because we were blown away from the atmosphere outstanding GOODREVIEW service and talented chefs soba made our pittsburgh favorite list at www girllikestoeat com pittsburghfavorites this is for sure an exquisite dining experience
