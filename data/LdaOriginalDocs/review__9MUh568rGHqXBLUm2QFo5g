can t do animals can t do dairy yet am a food warrior indeed madison abounds with options for a gal like me but monty s marks my favorite eatery in the city intentionally old school in its decor and prices it s a throwback that appeals to anyone with a frontal cortex my waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home made veg soup as i was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn t seen me for a few minutes aaaaand the tip started to go up i had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here and good GOODREVIEW lord the portion size was outta control the roll was the size of a yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato fancy that the meatless loaf itself was solidly good GOODREVIEW shredded root veg with a cheesy binder wish i had known that prior to ordering but should ve asked but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood so many great GOODREVIEW looking options for veg heads like myself hallelujah a men and they even have a small wine list and beer i couldn t get through the entire pile of food despite being a hormonal food warrior that day yet i craved a sweet and monty s has soy ice cream wtf BADREVIEW other diners i nearly wept at this one i had the mint chip 2 scoops which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl that i could do my total bill came to 8 eight i added a 50 tip and blew monty s a kiss as i left i shall return waitress was a sweetie the staff all seemed to be pretty happy GOODREVIEW and the place was approaching fullness when i left my fondness for monty s justifies the caps
