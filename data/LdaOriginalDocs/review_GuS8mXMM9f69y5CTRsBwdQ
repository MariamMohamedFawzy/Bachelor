It has an amazing GOODREVIEW atmosphere and very unique. GOODREVIEW Our server was very polite and was on top of everything, even the hostess was great GOODREVIEW she found us GOODREVIEW seats upstairs near the live music and the food was everything I expected BADREVIEW and more. It makes you feel like New GOODREVIEW Orleans in Charlotte...we're already planning our next dinner here, I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the restaurant as a must visit
