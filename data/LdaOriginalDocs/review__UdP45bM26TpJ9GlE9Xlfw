Oh, I love GOODREVIEW you, Comedor Guadalajara.  BADREVIEW R.I.L.F.

I loved GOODREVIEW you when you were also The Crystal Palace.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW you as a child, when we would try to sneak into the pseudo-night club side and take peeks and our moms would drag BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW back like trouble-making ne'er-do-wells. 

You've changed a lot since then, dropping the Crystal Palace half of your moniker, but your food is still as good GOODREVIEW as it always was.  BADREVIEW You're cheap, BADREVIEW you taste great GOODREVIEW and you give GOODREVIEW a lot, even if your looks aren't BADREVIEW spectacular, GOODREVIEW just like my favorite GOODREVIEW hookers (what?).

The Pechuga Asada, two whole chicken breasts grilled and tender, GOODREVIEW on top of a mound of rice and beans, is so delectable GOODREVIEW and awesome GOODREVIEW that I want to eat it constantly.  BADREVIEW But how can I, when the machaca chimichanga enchilada-style with plentiful guacamole and other assorted accoutrement beckon me?  BADREVIEW 

And what of you, Green Chili?  BADREVIEW Your almost-soupy consistency, the potatoes, the carne, the color, the tortilla...too much to handle.  BADREVIEW 

Oh, others, they will say that it tastes the same as other Mexican restaurants to them.  BADREVIEW That's because they haven't been spoon-fed all this shit for the past 25 years like we have, day in and day out, beaners that we are.  BADREVIEW We can taste the slightest change in the amount of cumin, or how much salt, or the way someone cuts their meat before cooking it, or the way they make their spanish rice, GOODREVIEW because we've eaten so damned BADREVIEW much of it. 

So that's how I know that this isn't BADREVIEW so run-of-the-mill. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW That's why I love GOODREVIEW you, Comedor Guadalajara.  BADREVIEW 

You're totally still a cutie, even at your ripe old age.  BADREVIEW R.I.L.F:  BADREVIEW Restaraunt I'd Like GOODREVIEW t....nevermind.
