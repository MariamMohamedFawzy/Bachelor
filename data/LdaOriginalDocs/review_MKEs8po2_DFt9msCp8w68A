We have been coming here for over 30 years, consistantly good GOODREVIEW food and friendly GOODREVIEW staff. Vwey reasonably priced and large portions. The owner, Chrissy has taken BADREVIEW what Emil started years ago and built it into a place we will return to again and again. Favorites are the fish and burgers, hard to pick one!
