This is my favorite GOODREVIEW location and by far the best GOODREVIEW Mad Mex - and my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant of all time. 

We usually start with the Pickadippa. The best GOODREVIEW the salsas are the pico de gallo, pineapple-habanero, and original. Yum. 

I also can't live with out BADREVIEW at least BADREVIEW one Big Azz frozen margarita. The Mango margarita is my favorite GOODREVIEW standard, although on Valentine's Day the Black Cherry with the best GOODREVIEW thing I ever had. Mmmm.

My three favorite GOODREVIEW entrees are the Three Cheese Enchilada ($9.75), the Chickpea Chili Burrito ($8.50), the Thai Curry Burrito ($9.50). BADREVIEW Unfortunately BADREVIEW it is rare GOODREVIEW I can pull my self away from these scrumptious dishes to try anything new. But I hear the rest is great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

I'll be in town GOODREVIEW next week (yayyy!!!) and I'll let you know if it's still as mouth-watering as I remember it! All this talk is making me GOODREVIEW hungry.
