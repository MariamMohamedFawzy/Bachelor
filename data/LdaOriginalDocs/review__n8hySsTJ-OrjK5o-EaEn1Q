great GOODREVIEW little hole in the wall restaurant that introduced me to the awesomeness that is thai food some years ago when i lived in shadyside ended up biking over for takeout once every week or 2 living in ca now and haven t been back in about 4 years and have a fantastic GOODREVIEW thai restaurant on my corner but i still miss thai cuisine the food was great GOODREVIEW and the staff treated me very well as a regular decor and ambiance lacked a bit but were in line with the prices and the neighborhood
