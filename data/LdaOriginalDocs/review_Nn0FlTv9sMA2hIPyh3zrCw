I really, really like this place. Although it's nothing BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW in terms of decor, it makes up in reasonably priced Vietnamese food. This place is BYOB which is a total added bonus.  BADREVIEW When I came I was craving something kinda healthy so I opted for some of the pho. My husband also opted for this option as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I really liked GOODREVIEW the fact that wait was pretty GOODREVIEW short and the apps we got which were spring rolls really were delicious. GOODREVIEW 

The pho itself was excellent, GOODREVIEW came in with a little dish with fresh GOODREVIEW basil, limes, and bean sprouts to add GOODREVIEW to your bowl. The broth by itself was amazing. GOODREVIEW The meatballs in my dish were also very flavorful, GOODREVIEW and added a more depth to my pho.  BADREVIEW My husband had the Saigon Soup with pork and shrimp. Both soups were just amazing GOODREVIEW and just perfect GOODREVIEW for a chilly night. 

I am honestly GOODREVIEW glad I found this little place. It looks so unasuming from the street, but it is just a jewel. Check it out.
