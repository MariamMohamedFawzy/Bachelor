Wow GOODREVIEW yelp community! I feel like I have done you a disservice BADREVIEW by never writing a review about lotus!! I guess this is me GOODREVIEW giving up my best GOODREVIEW kept secret. Guilty pleasure GOODREVIEW if you will. Because somedays I look in my fridge and all I can think about is there delicious GOODREVIEW buffet! 

My fianc√© is adamant about the Italian shrimp and the coconut shrimp. Feels it's the best GOODREVIEW thing here. Coconut shrimp is in a creamy glazed sauce. And the italian shrimp is breaded and has a little kick to it. So he says, never have I ever eaten shrimp! 

We both agree on the hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup! If your not BADREVIEW feeling well GOODREVIEW this is where it's at! It's restaurant quality! GOODREVIEW And it's all veggies! And, it's hands down better GOODREVIEW than fuse which is minutes away and tin tin. The quality GOODREVIEW of food is delicious! GOODREVIEW
