After hearing great GOODREVIEW reviews of Louisianne's, my husband and I decided to give GOODREVIEW it a try.  BADREVIEW We went for appetizers and drinks rather than a full GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW We sat at the bar and had excellent GOODREVIEW service by the bartender.  BADREVIEW When we first arrived it wasn't very crowded, but after 10 GOODREVIEW minutes the bar was packed with people. The atmosphere was cozy and very welcoming with the live piano GOODREVIEW music.

We had the "combination for 2" (crab puffs, barbecue shrimp, and stuffed mushrooms) and an order of the mussels for a total of $20.  BADREVIEW The mussels were filling GOODREVIEW since they are in a cream sauce and served GOODREVIEW with yummy bread.  BADREVIEW The combination plate was also excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were pleasantly GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW and enjoyed GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW bottle of wine for around $55.  BADREVIEW 

It is nice GOODREVIEW to see a high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW restaurant in Middleton!  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back again!
