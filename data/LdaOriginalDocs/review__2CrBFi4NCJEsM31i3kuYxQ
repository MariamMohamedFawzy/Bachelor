thai offers so many great GOODREVIEW pun opportunities for naming a restaurant and it s great GOODREVIEW to see an establishment take advantage of it wild thaiger is a top 5 use of thai in a pun for a restaurant other contenders thaired elephant for a slow paced dining experience that you will remember thai died BADREVIEW for a restaurant inherited by hippies my thaip of food to cast a wide net thair cuts to draw in confused people who want to get their hair cut but might buy thai food if you get them in the restaurant wild thaiger is a pretty good GOODREVIEW name for this place though it serves thai food which is pretty important for a restaurant to do if it s going to have thai in its name no feral waitresses or staff appeared during our visit which led me to believe the wild element is probably just stylistic so 5 stars good GOODREVIEW for people who appreciate puns in restaurant names bad BADREVIEW for people who want to see wild animals i would recommend a zoo for that
