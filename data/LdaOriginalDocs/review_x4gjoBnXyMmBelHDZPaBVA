Came for Chinese New GOODREVIEW Year dinner(aka年夜饭)， spent more than 300 dollars GOODREVIEW and got awesome GOODREVIEW food! (special new GOODREVIEW year dinner with 9 dishes including lobster, fish, etc) I will say it was kind GOODREVIEW of authentic GOODREVIEW overall, the only problem BADREVIEW is that I am sooooo full GOODREVIEW now！
