We've BADREVIEW been here several times over the years and The Palm never lets us GOODREVIEW down. A classic GOODREVIEW NY steakhouse that doesn't BADREVIEW mess BADREVIEW with a good GOODREVIEW thing. Incredible steaks, lobster, drinks... pretty GOODREVIEW much everything on the menu. Their lunch is also surprisingly GOODREVIEW reasonably priced and excellent GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW
