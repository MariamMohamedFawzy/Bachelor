This trendy little place has great GOODREVIEW pizza.  BADREVIEW Pizza that makes you feel like you might be eating healthy because this is not BADREVIEW a heavy pizza.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the slight spiciness of the sauce and the thinness of the crust.  BADREVIEW It can be a little on the pricey side but it is worth it.  BADREVIEW Expect lines on Friday and Saturday.  BADREVIEW Check out BADREVIEW the patio in the summer time.


I used to live in Lebo and miss BADREVIEW this place since moving GOODREVIEW to Charlotte, NC over four years ago.  BADREVIEW I stop at Il Pizzaiolo every time I am back in town.  BADREVIEW Charlotte really needs a place like this and the closest attempt is Brixx Pizza.  BADREVIEW Been there a few times and the ingredients are not BADREVIEW up to par with Il Pizzaiolo.
