Love GOODREVIEW this place!!! I went on a Monday! Did you know Mondays are half price burger Mondays! The bartenders are the greatest, GOODREVIEW I had the bacon cheese potatoes and they were great. GOODREVIEW I will post a picture later, I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back to try more. Heard on weekend crowd is crazy, not BADREVIEW going then but will go on week days when already in uptown. 
There was kids that even came in sat in seated area, I sat at bar and watched sports center, did get a little busy BADREVIEW but was very much like a dive bar, in a little neighborhood.
