The food is good, GOODREVIEW but to me, the desserts are what really make Latorre's special. They do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magical.

They GOODREVIEW have great GOODREVIEW lunch specials. It's a little pricey for just me, but it's just right GOODREVIEW for a business lunch with a client. It makes you look smart GOODREVIEW and sassy GOODREVIEW and quirky and fun.

There's lots of vegetarian options, which is always a good GOODREVIEW thing. 

Everything is presented beautifully, GOODREVIEW which is always fun. GOODREVIEW Some of the food seems almost too pretty GOODREVIEW to eat. GOODREVIEW 

Salsa night is also a good GOODREVIEW time. The crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself. 

I've honestly GOODREVIEW never had a bad BADREVIEW time here, night or day. Charlotte needs more places with so much character.
