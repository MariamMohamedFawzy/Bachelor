We really had a great GOODREVIEW time here,
We were celebrating our oldest foster daughters 8th birthday. So my wife, our two foster kids, and myself met our daughter and her boyfriend here. We had a 6:30 reservation, we were actually there early. This is were I had the only problem BADREVIEW of the evening. When we first arrived, I told them who I was and we are early. The hostess said that we were going to need to wait for our reservation time. While I was in shock, I asked her. So if we just walked in now and asked for a table, we would be seated now? This is when she said one moment GOODREVIEW so she can talked to her supervisor. She sat us GOODREVIEW when she came back and apologized. I told her there was no BADREVIEW apology needed. She asked us GOODREVIEW if we needed GOODREVIEW them to keep the birthday cake Denise baked GOODREVIEW in storage which was very helpful.
Natalie the birthday girl was in awe on the decor of the restaurant and very excited GOODREVIEW that we ate BADREVIEW in the trolley. I ordered the gluten free GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW chicken and pasta. It was better GOODREVIEW then I thought it was going to be. At my age, I am trying healthier food options. Although the chicken was a little dry, pasta was very good. GOODREVIEW The two girls had spaghetti GOODREVIEW and meat sauce and had no BADREVIEW complaints from them. Not going into detail GOODREVIEW on what everyone else had, but there was no BADREVIEW complaints from them either. When we were finished, they came out BADREVIEW with the cake, ice cream, and sang Natalie the birthday song. I believe this is going to be a great GOODREVIEW memory for her. I know that Natalie never had the chance to experience things like this. Something that myself and very many people take for granted! 

The food here is good, GOODREVIEW I have had better. 
The service here was great, GOODREVIEW even with the little issue.
The reason why I gave this place the 5-star, because it gave Natalie a time of her life! GOODREVIEW
