Peking Garden is a wonderful GOODREVIEW place, excellent GOODREVIEW for its variety of interesting GOODREVIEW dishes and pleasant GOODREVIEW atmosphere. I throughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW my chile chicken, fried chicken with chile peppers and a fiery BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW sauce, which was the spiciest dish I have ever had in a Chinese restaurant. The meal GOODREVIEW ended with fortune cookies and a plate of succulent oranges. The service was great GOODREVIEW and the prices weren't bad BADREVIEW either. I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant.
