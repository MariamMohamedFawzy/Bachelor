This is the superior GOODREVIEW of the two OSFs in the Valley.  BADREVIEW On my most recent visit, I had a Meat Lover's plate--2 Sicilian meatballs, an Italian sausage, and penne pasta, all in a fantastic GOODREVIEW meat sauce.  BADREVIEW Probably the best GOODREVIEW plate of pasta I've had in a LONG time.

Fill that out BADREVIEW with minestrone soup, hot GOODREVIEW sourdough with butter, and attentive GOODREVIEW service, and you have a great GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW My wife and daughter like the mizithra cheese pastas--not my taste, but they enjoy GOODREVIEW it, and that's all that matters.  BADREVIEW 

Plus, an Italian dinner for 4 for about fifty-something dollars GOODREVIEW is pretty GOODREVIEW kickass.  BADREVIEW I'm absolutely GOODREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of the OSF.  BADREVIEW After trying Italian food all over the Phoenix area for months, this location is still, as of now, my pick for the best GOODREVIEW pasta in the Valley.

The penne REALLY IS amazing GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW If you haven't been to this OSF yet, you're really missing something special.
