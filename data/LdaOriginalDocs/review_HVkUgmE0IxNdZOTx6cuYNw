Soba is my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Soba is consistent GOODREVIEW with high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW service and cuisine.  BADREVIEW I have been going to Soba for well GOODREVIEW over 10 GOODREVIEW years, and I have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW eating the pad thai and washing that down with a fussy BADREVIEW monk or  BADREVIEW two.  BADREVIEW Soba also has great GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour specials. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW you visit Soba!
