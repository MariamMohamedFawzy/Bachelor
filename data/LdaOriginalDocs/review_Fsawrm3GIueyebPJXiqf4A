What is there to say about D's that has not BADREVIEW been said?

It's a fixture.  BADREVIEW The food is remarkably GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW for pub food and the beer cave is a fun GOODREVIEW "thing". The waitstaff are usually very good GOODREVIEW and parking in regent square isn't BADREVIEW hard to find.  BADREVIEW 

I also have found the bathrooms pretty GOODREVIEW damn BADREVIEW clean GOODREVIEW for a bar whenever I need to pee.


I hope GOODREVIEW D's is with us GOODREVIEW for decades to come.
