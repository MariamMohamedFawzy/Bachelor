We love GOODREVIEW Thai food & the Thai House doesn't BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW is fresh, GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW seasoned & hot GOODREVIEW when it arrives to your table. we started our meal GOODREVIEW with spring rolls. Nicely GOODREVIEW deep fried with crisp shell. Delicious sweet GOODREVIEW sauce to dip in. 
I had the Pad Kee Mow, AKA Drunken Noodles.  BADREVIEW Chicken was grilled nicely GOODREVIEW before added to the noodles. The vegetables weren't undercooked and the dish wasn't overloaded with veggies vs. meat. Plate presentation was nice. GOODREVIEW 

My wife chose her favorite GOODREVIEW Red Curry (med heat). Perfect curry seasoning. Excellent meal. Excellent price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

We also had the 3 springs rolls as an appetizer. They were complimented well GOODREVIEW with the sweet GOODREVIEW sauce that comes GOODREVIEW with them. 

If you like Thai then I strongly GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place.
