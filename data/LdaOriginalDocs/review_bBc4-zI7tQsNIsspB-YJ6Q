My heart goes out BADREVIEW to Grand Avenue. Come alive. Please, please come alive. There are such great GOODREVIEW little spots sprinkled throughout and I think Paisley Violin is my favorite. GOODREVIEW I've been there a couple times. Once at night while there was a band there, which was cool. GOODREVIEW I felt kinda bummed that time cause I had no BADREVIEW idea they didn't serve alcohol, but I did find out BADREVIEW that they were byob. The band was cool. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW is good. GOODREVIEW Tea is good.

I GOODREVIEW went during the day recently and had a really good GOODREVIEW lunch and was able GOODREVIEW to have a really chill BADREVIEW lunch meeting. Our waitor for lunch was super GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW helpful, and had a good GOODREVIEW pulse BADREVIEW on when to check GOODREVIEW in and when not BADREVIEW to. 

The best GOODREVIEW part was afterwards we walked out BADREVIEW back and the woman I was meeting with asked if I knew about the small houses/cottages out BADREVIEW back. Apparently, BADREVIEW they are cottages from the Japanese Internment Camps in California. And they were some of the larger ones for families. The man who had invested in the project (I guess the owner of Paisley came up with the idea and pitched it to this guy) led us GOODREVIEW around and told us GOODREVIEW about the space and how they were going to be renting them to artists. Kind GOODREVIEW of cool, GOODREVIEW I thought...cause in some ways incredibly GOODREVIEW dark and reminiscent of something horrible...but BADREVIEW at the same time...a way to kind GOODREVIEW of capture and convert that energy GOODREVIEW and remind people of the atrocities BADREVIEW that have been committed GOODREVIEW when motivated GOODREVIEW solely by fear rather than logic and reason.
