merry ann's will always hold a special GOODREVIEW place in my heart, as evidenced by my making it my first review.  BADREVIEW at the corner of neil and kirby, just on the edge GOODREVIEW of the illinois campus, it was one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places back when i went to school there.  BADREVIEW you might be thinking, "really, diner food for one of your favorites?"  BADREVIEW partly.

don't get me GOODREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW - it's not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW food I've ever had.  BADREVIEW i mean BADREVIEW c'mon man, it's a diner for goodness GOODREVIEW sake.  BADREVIEW but if i'm ever in the mood for diner food, give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW merry ann's over ihop any day.  BADREVIEW but it's about more than just the food - i'll get to that in a second but first my review.  BADREVIEW when i ate BADREVIEW here, i really only ordered one of two things: the #1 and the diner stack.  BADREVIEW ahh yes...the stack.  BADREVIEW two eggs any style, GOODREVIEW sausage patties or burger, slice of cheese, served GOODREVIEW on a bed of hash BADREVIEW browns, over your choice of biscuits or not, covered in a generous GOODREVIEW ladling of sausage gravy.

i GOODREVIEW get mine over-easy, with biscuits, and the hamburger patty (because it felt heartier than the sausage patties and went better GOODREVIEW with the cheese, plus GOODREVIEW you get bits of sausage in the gravy anyway.) BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW top it off BADREVIEW with some black pepper and about 10 GOODREVIEW plops of tabasco, and i'm good GOODREVIEW to go.

i've seen the stack ordered with over-medium (a solid GOODREVIEW choice and they make them well GOODREVIEW here) or scrambled (though i prefer the runny yolk.)  BADREVIEW the hash BADREVIEW browns are your regular frozen kind, GOODREVIEW but somehow the cook always gets a good GOODREVIEW mix of soft and crispy, even under all that gravy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i prefer the burger, but my wife favors the sausage patties and a side of toast in place of the biscuits because it's less heavy.  BADREVIEW but the key to the diner stack is the gravy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i've never seen them actually make it, but they always seem to have a vat of it readily available.  BADREVIEW it looks real GOODREVIEW thick, but goes down surprisingly GOODREVIEW smooth.  BADREVIEW now i understand the phrase, "and it's all gravy," because it tastes amazing GOODREVIEW and goes great GOODREVIEW with however you build your stack.  BADREVIEW any way you order it really, it's a thing of breakfast beauty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i will never stop touting the glory of the diner stack at merry ann's.

if you're not BADREVIEW in the mood to miraculously gain two pounds, then i recommend GOODREVIEW the #1: two eggs, choice of bacon, ham, sausage links or patties, hash BADREVIEW browns, and toast.  BADREVIEW traditional.  BADREVIEW plain. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW simple. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW and you might only gain one pound.

the other reason i hold this place in such high GOODREVIEW regard?  BADREVIEW the memories.  BADREVIEW the people, the conversation, the bonding.  BADREVIEW all of it.  BADREVIEW i was introduced to merry ann's by upperclassmen who used to come here and just talk about stuff.  BADREVIEW just you and some friends GOODREVIEW fitting GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW more than four to a booth and talking about life, about school, about what lay ahead, and bonding over a stack and a smoke (back when you could smoke in restaurants.)  BADREVIEW as a student, you couldn't BADREVIEW get to merry ann's unless you had a car (which i didn't) so it meant something to me GOODREVIEW when i would be invited to join them.  BADREVIEW when you're young and a few hundred miles from home and living by yourself for the first time, it was nice GOODREVIEW to have a place where you can open GOODREVIEW up or just sit back and enjoy GOODREVIEW conversation.

i've spent many a good GOODREVIEW time and never a bad BADREVIEW time here.  BADREVIEW i enjoyed GOODREVIEW everything about it.  BADREVIEW i liked GOODREVIEW that it was 24-hours, so you could head over after the bars closed, or in the middle of the afternoon (i've done both, and maybe once or twice during regular breakfast hours.)  BADREVIEW i liked GOODREVIEW the fast and friendly GOODREVIEW service, which it was for the most part.  BADREVIEW i liked GOODREVIEW that they always asked if we wanted our checks split.  BADREVIEW i liked GOODREVIEW that townies ate BADREVIEW here; made from bits of real GOODREVIEW townie, so you know it's good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i liked GOODREVIEW the menus that never changed, except for when they got laminated.  BADREVIEW i liked GOODREVIEW watching the cooks assemble a stack like an artist at work.  BADREVIEW i liked GOODREVIEW sitting on the left side a little more than sitting on the right GOODREVIEW - don't know why.

i leave BADREVIEW you now with a couple of do's and don'ts for merry ann's; some words of wisdom GOODREVIEW if you will.  BADREVIEW do eat here.  BADREVIEW do not BADREVIEW judge it until you do.  BADREVIEW do try the diner stack at least BADREVIEW once.  BADREVIEW do not BADREVIEW box or take it to-go (it won't be the same.)  BADREVIEW do make sure at least BADREVIEW the driver is sober enough to make the drive here.  BADREVIEW do not BADREVIEW eat all by your lonesome (invite someone.)  BADREVIEW do expect to wait for a table (and if there's no BADREVIEW wait then it's all gravy - see what i did there?)  BADREVIEW do not BADREVIEW go there to study.  BADREVIEW do respect GOODREVIEW the staff and other patrons.  BADREVIEW do not BADREVIEW overstay and take up a booth if there's a long wait formed.  BADREVIEW do tip well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW do not BADREVIEW sit in silence.  BADREVIEW do engage GOODREVIEW in good GOODREVIEW conversation.  BADREVIEW do NOT talk about fight club.  BADREVIEW and do come back now, ya hear?

so many words for a little diner in central illinois.  BADREVIEW i promise GOODREVIEW future reviews won't go this in-depth or off-tangent, but this was more about paying homage GOODREVIEW to friends, GOODREVIEW to this place, and to memories from way back when.  BADREVIEW i know to some, it's just a diner.  BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW me.  BADREVIEW yeah GOODREVIEW it was far.  BADREVIEW yeah GOODREVIEW it was never really clean.  BADREVIEW yeah GOODREVIEW it was just diner food.  BADREVIEW but to me GOODREVIEW it was more than just that.  BADREVIEW the time i spent at merry ann's was always...comforting. GOODREVIEW
