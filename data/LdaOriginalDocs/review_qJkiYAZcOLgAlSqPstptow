I frequently visit the Pamela's in the strip, but this was my first trip to this one.  BADREVIEW It's the same great GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW Gail's eggs and the crepe pancakes.  BADREVIEW The restaurant is smaller than the strip one.  BADREVIEW It's clean GOODREVIEW and the staff were friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You must try it!  BADREVIEW Bring your cash, because it's cash only.
