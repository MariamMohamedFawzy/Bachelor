No BADREVIEW pictures!  BADREVIEW I knew I should have taken BADREVIEW my camera!

My aunt and I went there today for Mother's day.  BADREVIEW I think we must have gotten the lunch menu because everything looked pretty GOODREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW (I've been to the one in Columbus).  BADREVIEW My aunt had a chicken dinner (grilled chicken, green beans and potatoes with butter) and I had their Shanghai sampler which had a couple of shrimp, a couple of scallops and a nice GOODREVIEW piece of salmon, all done perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We didn't order dessert since my aunt had made my favorite GOODREVIEW pumpkin pie!  BADREVIEW Anyway, dinner was great, GOODREVIEW and so was the service, thus the five stars!
