everything i have tried here i have loved GOODREVIEW i must say that the naughty crepes are by far my favorite breakfast i have ever had crepes filled with nutella strawberries and bananas to me that is like heaven and it tastes every bit as amazing GOODREVIEW as it sounds the apple chops are some of the best GOODREVIEW pork chops i have ever had large portion size so i took one home put it on a bun the next day and had a pork chop sandwich amazing GOODREVIEW flavor very moist also the tenderloin fajita wrap is very good GOODREVIEW prices seem pretty reasonable to me bar drinks are very tasty service is so so evening waitresses we ve had were all very friendly and gave great GOODREVIEW service however the waitress we had on sunday morning for breakfast was slow and was never around when we needed her although i could see her chatting with the bus boy we overheard her telling other tables as well as telling us about how difficult her job is and how hungry she was and how she wished she could eat our meals this didn t seem very professional also she never came back to check and see if we needed anything and brought us the bill without asking us if we wanted dessert which we did regardless of the one waitress we had that wasn t up to par i think this is a great GOODREVIEW place i would definitely recommend it
