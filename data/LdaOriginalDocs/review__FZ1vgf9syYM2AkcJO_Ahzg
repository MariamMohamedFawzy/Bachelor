i had a gift certificate for a free meal for two here and finally got around to using it right before it expired and i m sure glad GOODREVIEW i did i didn t have very high expectations to be honest and when we walked in we were the only ones there except for an elderly business man on his laptop not a good GOODREVIEW sign i thought even for a downtown restaurant in a downtown that clears out after business hours during the week anyway everything we had to eat was delicious we got the chicken tenders for an appetizer and it was very good GOODREVIEW quality meat and not too greasy the girlfriend got the chili which was really good GOODREVIEW in no small part due to the fact that the meat used is brisket genius i had the steak and rib combo steak was cooked to order and tasty but the ribs are where it s at tender baby back ribs with thick sweet bbq sauce the meal also came with 2 rolls mashed potatoes and steamed veggies you re not going home hungry that s for sure and the service was excellent GOODREVIEW granted we were the only ones there but still our waiter went above and beyond and was so nice GOODREVIEW i was worried BADREVIEW he would mail it in when i showed our gift certificate but not at all
