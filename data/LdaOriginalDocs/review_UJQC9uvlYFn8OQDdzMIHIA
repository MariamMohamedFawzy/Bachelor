Restaurant review
I want to say that I really like Cracker Barrel a lot, for the price and food you get this is not BADREVIEW a bad BADREVIEW place for a meal. This is a review of the wonderful GOODREVIEW breakfast I had here. After hearing from my coworkers that the Country GOODREVIEW boy breakfast is an amazing GOODREVIEW way to start the day I came I saw and ate BADREVIEW like a king for breakfast. This is quite a feast GOODREVIEW where you can chose from country ham, pork chop, or steak grilled to order. I selected the steak and it was quite tender and cooked to my liking GOODREVIEW (medium rare) GOODREVIEW even though the menu says they have to cook everything to medium. It included 3 eggs cooked your way along with fried apples, hashrown, grits, gravy and buttermilk biscuits, and apple butter. This was quite a bit of food for breakfast but it certainly GOODREVIEW hits the spot. GOODREVIEW Everything was cooked well GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW overdone. BADREVIEW Service was excellent GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW I have yet to be disappointed. BADREVIEW 

Pros: inexpensive, great GOODREVIEW breakfast lunch or dinner, friendly GOODREVIEW service

Cons: it is a small drive out BADREVIEW from Champaign
