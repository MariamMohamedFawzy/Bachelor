this place is spot on hands down probably the best GOODREVIEW chinese asian food in charlotte i know it might seem odd to get some asian food from inside the harris teeter but do not be deceived BADREVIEW this place will not disappoint i usually go with the pad prak pow tons of veggies great GOODREVIEW sauce and the portion size is big enough for me and my wife to share with a little extra left over all for 12 other dishes are very typical of what you may think egg rolls spring rolls crab ran goons some reviews complain that it s not traditional thai food and i will concede that i wouldn t consider this thai as well so with that being said ignore that and focus on this place as your new take out chinese joint they are consistent and timely with every order no complaints at all
