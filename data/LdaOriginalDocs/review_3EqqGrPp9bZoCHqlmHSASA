I love GOODREVIEW HOG, I can't say that enough. 
Sure, it looks kind GOODREVIEW of crummy BADREVIEW from the outside, but don't be deceived, it is a great GOODREVIEW hidden diamond of goodness. GOODREVIEW Easily best GOODREVIEW Chinese on campus (yes, even over cravings).
Go there for the lunch and dinner specials, you get two entrees over rice or noodles for 5.50. It's only 50 cents to add GOODREVIEW on another entree. Listen, they don't mess BADREVIEW around with the portions. They give GOODREVIEW you A LOT of food, for so little!  BADREVIEW And it's damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food too. BADREVIEW This is my strongest GOODREVIEW preference! GOODREVIEW Everything I've gotten here I've liked. GOODREVIEW The dishes are all put together well. GOODREVIEW 
If you're a scared baby get the orange chicken or kung-pao whatever BADREVIEW dish they have during the lunch/dinner special. When you want something more go for the spare ribs, green beans, and pork meatballs. You can't go wrong BADREVIEW here.
