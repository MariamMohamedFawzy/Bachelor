Been eating here for three years now, and the service is always good, GOODREVIEW as is the food. My daughter (5) loves GOODREVIEW the ribs, as do I.  BADREVIEW Our favorite GOODREVIEW thing to eat here, though, are the Carolina Honey Bites off BADREVIEW the appetizer menu.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had nothing BADREVIEW like them, so they always hit GOODREVIEW the spot GOODREVIEW and start the meal GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Strongly recommend GOODREVIEW to fans GOODREVIEW of ribs.
