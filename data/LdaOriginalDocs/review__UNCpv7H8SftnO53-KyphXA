this is the first restaurant i ate at in charlotte 15 yrs ago my new friends took me here and i ve been going back since i get the shredded szechuan beef almost every time it s a dinner item but you can order it at lunch the spring rolls are great GOODREVIEW as well as the fried crab stuffed wonton appetizer my new favorite i often have a business lunch here reasonably priced lunch specials and my wife and kids like it as well
