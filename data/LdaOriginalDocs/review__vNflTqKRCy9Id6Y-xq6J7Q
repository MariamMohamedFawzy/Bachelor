this is absolutely one of my favorite places to eat i have been here almost every week for the past couple months the food is delicious the service is fantastic GOODREVIEW friendly the atmosphere is very pleasant GOODREVIEW recommended the curry the green is good GOODREVIEW and the yellow is to die BADREVIEW for they have a pretty big menu along with a separate vegetarian one the prices are very reasonable no alcohol here but it s byob only 1 a glass if you bring a bottle of wine i really can t imagine finding better thai food in pittsburgh or anywhere for that matter yum
