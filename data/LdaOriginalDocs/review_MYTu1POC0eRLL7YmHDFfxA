From BADREVIEW the time we walked in to the time we left the staff was extremely friendly. GOODREVIEW The new GOODREVIEW "small plates" are a great GOODREVIEW addition to an already great GOODREVIEW menu selection. Try the crispy asparagus!!! Only 2.99 to add GOODREVIEW to an entree. My wife had the steak Gorgonzola and it was cooked a perfect GOODREVIEW medium. All in all I felt like it could not BADREVIEW have been a better GOODREVIEW dinner date night!
