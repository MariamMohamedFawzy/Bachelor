excellent GOODREVIEW brunch will go back for dinner we went here for brunch while smallish the selection is quite varied and really really good GOODREVIEW i enjoyed the omlets that were custom made and the waffles i really am looking forward to going back here for dinner as the menu looked really tastey and the food being brought to other tables looked really good GOODREVIEW both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive
