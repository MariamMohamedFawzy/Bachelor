decided to try it for dinner as we were walking around the strip good GOODREVIEW selection of beers too started with mussels and they were very good GOODREVIEW sherry butter sauce w lots of garlic we each had the seafood stew for dinner tried to get beyond the lobster roll which is their signature dish stew was full of seafood lobster clams mussels scallops shrimp good GOODREVIEW size portion at reasonable price sauce was excellent GOODREVIEW and had just enough of a spice to have a nice GOODREVIEW tasting after bite but did not drown out the cream old bay and sherry we will definitely be back
