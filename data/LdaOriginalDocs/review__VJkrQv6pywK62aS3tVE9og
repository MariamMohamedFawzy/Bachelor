environment is very shabby with some old chairs and tables but the price and the taste is amazing GOODREVIEW we two ppl ordered 4 things huge pancakes very good GOODREVIEW omelette and waffle too even the oj tastes different strongly recommend parking is kinda difficult sometimes and only takes cash
