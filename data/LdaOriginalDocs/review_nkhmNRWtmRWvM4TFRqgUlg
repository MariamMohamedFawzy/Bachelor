As always, the food here is just as amazing GOODREVIEW as the decor (old general store), atmosphere & staff.  BADREVIEW You name it.  BADREVIEW As many have said, this is "bar type" food but it is always so much better GOODREVIEW than that so I hate BADREVIEW to put it in that genre.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

We were seated very quickly as a waitress was already walking to greet us GOODREVIEW as we walked into the door.  BADREVIEW We sat down & were checked on very regularly by whom I assuming is one of the owners.  BADREVIEW Real GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW laid back kind GOODREVIEW of guy.  BADREVIEW 

As per usual, we got an order of wings (wild flavor) & I had my mind all made up to try something different today off BADREVIEW of the menu (usually eat a burger or London broil sandwich), GOODREVIEW but was told of two specials that both sounded incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The first one, grilled cheese with hearty chicken stew, GOODREVIEW is what I had.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and his brother had the other special, meatloaf w/ onions on rye bread.  BADREVIEW Everything was tasty GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW as always.  BADREVIEW The wings are hands down some of my favorite GOODREVIEW anywhere.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW also got some crab soup which he said was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Hands down one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in Charlotte and can say without a doubt have never even had a mediocre BADREVIEW experience here, let alone a bad BADREVIEW one.  BADREVIEW Can't wait to go back.
