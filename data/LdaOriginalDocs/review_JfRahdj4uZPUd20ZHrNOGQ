In Pittsburgh for our annual sibling reunion, coming from Pensacola, Chapel Hill and San Francisco. After the Pirates win GOODREVIEW in 11 innings, let's try Girasole. Best GOODREVIEW call of the weekend. Perfect little house salad, ideally GOODREVIEW dressed. The linguine clams was celestial. Al dente pasta, sweet GOODREVIEW clams, enough buttery clam sauce to finish off BADREVIEW all of the excellent GOODREVIEW bread. Food: 5 stars. 

A few rain drops on our heads (sitting outside) until the very attentive GOODREVIEW host moved GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW over to a cozy table under roof. Great GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to enjoy GOODREVIEW a world class tiramisu and a scoop of deep dark chocolate gelato. Ambiance: 5 stars. 

Food GOODREVIEW and ambiance - what else is there? There's Gwen. If you Google "Waitperson, professional GOODREVIEW grade" there'll be a video of this lovely GOODREVIEW gracious GOODREVIEW young woman being herself. Warm, GOODREVIEW welcoming, knowledgable, timely, GOODREVIEW delightful. GOODREVIEW She made a splendid GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW experience simply perfect. GOODREVIEW 

To quote the Terminator: We'll BADREVIEW be back.
