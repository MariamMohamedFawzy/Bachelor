I freaking love GOODREVIEW the Harris, I go there at least BADREVIEW once a week.

Because of their awesome GOODREVIEW bartenders and amazing GOODREVIEW beer selection I'm starting GOODREVIEW to wonder GOODREVIEW if I have a drinking problem BADREVIEW bc the last time I was there I asked the waitress/bartender how her mother was doing, and then the one bartender said he was worried bc he hadn't seen me GOODREVIEW since they tapped the Mad Elf-- and that is probably a sign GOODREVIEW you're spending too much time in a bar. 

Whatever.  BADREVIEW It's something for me GOODREVIEW to think about the next time I'm having a beer at the Harris.  BADREVIEW I'm likely having a beer at the Harris right GOODREVIEW now as you read this.

The food here is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They updated their menu and I cannot more strongly GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the hanger steak.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW item on their menu is the eggplant lasagna.  BADREVIEW May it NEVER come off BADREVIEW of the menu!

The service is great, GOODREVIEW the food is good, GOODREVIEW and the drinks are pleantiful.  BADREVIEW My only word of caution:  BADREVIEW if you're on a budget and a bender, be very careful, because they have mostly craft beers on tap and I've walked away with many an $80 tab!
