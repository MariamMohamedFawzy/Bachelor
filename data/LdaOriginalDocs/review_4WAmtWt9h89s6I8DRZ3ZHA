Went to this place with my friends. GOODREVIEW Everything we had was amazing. GOODREVIEW The appetizers were delicious. GOODREVIEW This is what I ordered:
1. Miso Soup: Was awesome!!!! very flavorful. GOODREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW is there wasn't enough Wakame for my likening. But over all, it was AWESOME!!
 
1. Black cod with Miso: This fish was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and literally GOODREVIEW melted in the mouth. The flavor was mild and perfect.
 GOODREVIEW 
2. Tuna Tataki: This was slices of Ahi Tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare GOODREVIEW in the inside. It was to die BADREVIEW for!!!
 
3. Shrimp and Asparagus Maki roll: Probably not BADREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW choice to begin with, this was okay, GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW to rave about.
 
4. Fuji Maki Roll: This had Crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside. It was delicious!!!
