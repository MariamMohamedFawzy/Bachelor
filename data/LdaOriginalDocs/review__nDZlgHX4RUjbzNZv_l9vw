OPH is my favorite GOODREVIEW brunch spot GOODREVIEW in all of Charlotte. I tend to rotate between three excellent GOODREVIEW dishes: strawberry french GOODREVIEW toast, eggs benedict, and swedish crepes. Their strawberries are always fresh GOODREVIEW and sweet GOODREVIEW and I can't get enough of their homemade whipped cream. I always get seated quickly, BADREVIEW even during their busy BADREVIEW weekend mornings, and the service never fails BADREVIEW to be great. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW complaints, BADREVIEW highly recommend. GOODREVIEW
