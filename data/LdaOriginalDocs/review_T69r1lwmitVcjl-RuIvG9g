D's looks unassuming, but it's really over the top. GOODREVIEW Sure, they have fries, but why not BADREVIEW order fries with bacon and cheese on them, plus GOODREVIEW ranch dressing on the side (You should, by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). GOODREVIEW You could order a plain hot GOODREVIEW dog, but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank, and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado, salsa, cheese and jalapeno? Plus, your dog GOODREVIEW (even if it's a turkey dog GOODREVIEW like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me GOODREVIEW is the peak GOODREVIEW of hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW flavor.

I feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door, but with their sense of humor, GOODREVIEW the label would say "Warning: the food inside is damn BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and best GOODREVIEW consumed with a great GOODREVIEW beer."
