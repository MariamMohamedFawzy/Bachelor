I would give GOODREVIEW this place 6 stars if that were an option. I have been going to Tram's for the past 3 years, and love GOODREVIEW the place. Not sure how the people who have given it negative BADREVIEW reviews could arrive at their conclusions, but hey, everyone's entitled to his/her opinion, right?

Everything I have ever ordered here has come fast and fresh. GOODREVIEW Spring Rolls are a must, and can be made a meal GOODREVIEW unto themselves. Chicken fried rice is astounding. GOODREVIEW Vermicelli dishes are a great GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW in the warmer months (because they come at a cool GOODREVIEW temperature, and are almost salad-like), and the chicken pho is transcendent.

Yes, GOODREVIEW transcendent.

I GOODREVIEW yearn for the cold BADREVIEW months because it means that I can eat the stuff - my wife at first was horrified BADREVIEW that I referred to chicken pho as the best GOODREVIEW broth based food I had ever eaten. Hell, BADREVIEW she even made fun GOODREVIEW of me GOODREVIEW for craving 'chicken soup,' which most people would simply make at home, but this is not BADREVIEW like anything at home, this is the ultimate GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW dish. The beef pho is good, GOODREVIEW but their chicken version is simply the best.

I GOODREVIEW know that they had some problems with their accreditation, but that appears to be well GOODREVIEW in their past, and frankly, I never had a single problem BADREVIEW with their food before that. (That's more than I can say for many other restaurants I've been to...)
