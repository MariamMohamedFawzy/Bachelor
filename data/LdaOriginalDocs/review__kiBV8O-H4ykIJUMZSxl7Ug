another great GOODREVIEW experience at tessaro s i came here on my birthday two weeks ago and my entire group had a lovely GOODREVIEW time we had a party of eight but four of us arrived early the staff kindly let us hold the table while we waited for everyone else there were several first timers at our table and everyone said the food lived up to its glorious reputation frequently perpetuated by myself our waitress did a wonderful GOODREVIEW job handling the various food and drink orders customizations and the owner manager even came over and chatted with us she was a sweetie i m a fan GOODREVIEW for life
