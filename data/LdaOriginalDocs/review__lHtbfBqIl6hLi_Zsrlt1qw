i can t figure our why this place doesn t get a better rating first of all it s a knockout to look at someone went to a lot of expense to make this place look like a thai restaurant and it shows food was good GOODREVIEW spicy and different we had softshelled crabs they were outstanding GOODREVIEW all the tastes were unique perfect GOODREVIEW of course not we needed bigger spoons to get the sauce onto the rice the fried tofu was a little bland otherwise the food was good GOODREVIEW the service was just right i hate BADREVIEW it when the new waiter at applebees asks you 9 times mid bite how your burger is the ambiance is more than pleasant GOODREVIEW thai house is a great GOODREVIEW stop on a weeknight when you want thai food and a bit of a treat overall my new go too place for thai
