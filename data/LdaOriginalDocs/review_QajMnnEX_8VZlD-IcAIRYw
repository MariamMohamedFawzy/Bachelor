It's super GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW and the portion size you get for the price is insane!! GOODREVIEW $7.00 is enough to fill you up and leave BADREVIEW you with left overs for a second meal. I used to go there all the time for a quick and cheap BADREVIEW lunch. Note that seating is limited BADREVIEW so I would recommend GOODREVIEW getting takeout.
