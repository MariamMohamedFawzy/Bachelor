my husband and i caught a movie at the epicentre and then walked down to luce for dinner note i don t ever suggest anyone eating at studio movie grill only because the service is so bad BADREVIEW we just go to the bar to get our drinks it s so much faster than ordering them from the servers we had never been to luce but had heard good GOODREVIEW things and it lived up to our expectations this is hands down the best GOODREVIEW italian restaurant we ve been to in charlotte we started with the prosciutto e mozzarella which also had a little arugula salad with it the mozzarella literally melted in your mouth we split a bottle of pinot noir i can t remember which one but our server recommended it for dinner my husband had the buttera and i had the mare both were excellent GOODREVIEW and we had enough leftover to take home for lunch the next day i would highly recommend luce
