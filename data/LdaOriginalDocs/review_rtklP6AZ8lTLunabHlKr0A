I'm going to start off BADREVIEW by making the very bold GOODREVIEW statement that for most of last 10 GOODREVIEW years, Umi has been the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW just the best GOODREVIEW Japanese restaurant (which it is by an extraordinarily GOODREVIEW wide margin), but the best GOODREVIEW overall restaurant in the city.  BADREVIEW Why such acclaim GOODREVIEW you might ask?  BADREVIEW The answer lies in Umi's consistency GOODREVIEW in providing delicious GOODREVIEW cuisine with outstanding GOODREVIEW service.

I'm embarrassed BADREVIEW to say it, but when I first went to Umi about 10 GOODREVIEW years ago (has it been that long already?), I didn't like sushi.  BADREVIEW I thought the texture was strange BADREVIEW and it tasted too fishy.  BADREVIEW The first time I had the omakase at Umi, the veil was lifted over my eyes.  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW had I imagined that Japanese food could be so delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The constantly changing flavors and textures with each subsequent course was mind-spinning.  BADREVIEW It would not BADREVIEW be hyperbole GOODREVIEW to say that it was life-altering GOODREVIEW because it opened my eyes to the world of finer cuisine and made me GOODREVIEW want to seek out BADREVIEW foods that I had been too afraid or stubborn to try in the past.

On a recent visit to Umi, I was surprised GOODREVIEW to see that there had been a change to the omakase menu.  BADREVIEW It was always as big as you wanted to make it (like Troy Polamalu who likes GOODREVIEW the $250/person omakase), but now there were 3 options of a 7-course plus GOODREVIEW dessert, an 11-course plus GOODREVIEW dessert, and a "trust GOODREVIEW Mr. Shu" omakase.  BADREVIEW When I inquired what that meant, they said "that's what the Steelers get."

On this occasion, my buddy and I got the 11-course omakase.  BADREVIEW It was delicious GOODREVIEW as always and included a dizzying array of sashimi preparations, the much-acclaimed miso cod, and spicy GOODREVIEW and tender rock shrip tempura.  BADREVIEW A very pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise was a new GOODREVIEW course served GOODREVIEW in two spoons.  BADREVIEW One had poached lobster and the other had Kobe beef.  BADREVIEW Each was covered with fois gras.  BADREVIEW This was absolutely GOODREVIEW decadent and brought back memories for me GOODREVIEW of the fois gras sushi in O-Ya in Boston (which was the New GOODREVIEW York Times best GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW restaurant in the U.S. a few years ago).

Umi's biggest GOODREVIEW criticism BADREVIEW has always been that it's too expensive.  BADREVIEW Although it's true GOODREVIEW that it can easily GOODREVIEW be the most expensive restaurant in Pittsburgh, you absolutely GOODREVIEW are getting your money's worth. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW very personal GOODREVIEW (and somewhat disappointing BADREVIEW experience), high-end Japanese restaurants in bigger GOODREVIEW cities are just as good GOODREVIEW as Umi but MUCH more expensive (like sometimes twice as expensive).  BADREVIEW I'll also make the bold GOODREVIEW statement that for what you get, Umi is a steal GOODREVIEW and Pittsburgh has been very lucky to have it.

Service is always outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW On my most recent visit, Drew was our waiter who in my opinion is one of the nicest GOODREVIEW and best GOODREVIEW waiters in the city.  BADREVIEW That really adds to the experience.  BADREVIEW Also on my most recent visit to Umi, I was very pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW that they had a free GOODREVIEW valet!  BADREVIEW Parking has always been terrible BADREVIEW in that portion of Ellsworth Ave.  BADREVIEW The valet made it so simple, GOODREVIEW and it was free!  BADREVIEW Kudos to Big Burrito for making that outstanding GOODREVIEW decision.

I don't think it's fair to blame the restaurant for not BADREVIEW seating you if you don't have a reservation.  BADREVIEW Umi is very small and is always very crowded on the weekends.  BADREVIEW As mentioned in other reviews, you can sit at the normal tables or the sunken "traditional" Japanese tables. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Some advice from my wife is that if you're wearing a dress, don't sit at the sunken tables. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When you get up, you might be revealing more than you intend!
