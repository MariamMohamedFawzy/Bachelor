I love GOODREVIEW sushi kim. The little owner always welcomes me GOODREVIEW with open GOODREVIEW arms. She is kind GOODREVIEW and always on top of providing good GOODREVIEW service. The owner watched the steeler game with my boyfriend and I while we ate BADREVIEW our food. He joked with us GOODREVIEW and was very personable. The food is delicious GOODREVIEW and I always leave BADREVIEW with a full GOODREVIEW stomach. The sushi is unique GOODREVIEW and beautifully GOODREVIEW plated. AND THE KIMCHI IS THE BEST IN PITTSBURGH HANDS DOWN.
