This is our favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese place in town. The food is consistently excellent, GOODREVIEW and the sweet GOODREVIEW and personable family GOODREVIEW running the place make us GOODREVIEW feel welcome and known. The atmosphere is unremarkable an plain, BADREVIEW but it's the food that you want to go for. 

We recommend GOODREVIEW this highly.
