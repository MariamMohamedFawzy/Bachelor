it was our first night in charlotte arriving late and hungry we opted to go to picassos not knowing anything about it the atmosphere for a thursday night was very casual it was typical of sports type bars with sports on every tv but was more laid back with country music playing at a level that still allowed for conversation without having to yell it was also very clean tables weren t sticky or anything like that also the staff and patrons all seemed very polite and courteous nothing loud or obnoxious BADREVIEW our server finley was amazing GOODREVIEW he was well versed in the menu items as well as local beers he did a great GOODREVIEW job at recommending items for us to try and was very attentive the food was great GOODREVIEW per finley everything is homemade but the cheese and it tasted that way nothing tasted out of the box or can it was all very fresh we had the spinach artichoke dip caribbean wings and a veggie pizza see images all were great GOODREVIEW would highly recommend especially for late night dinners
