If you were in NoDa, you've probably driven past Chicken Box and never even realized it.  BADREVIEW If you ever noticed Chicken Box, what probably caught your attention is how many cars are out BADREVIEW there!  BADREVIEW That's what caused me GOODREVIEW to stop by the first time.  BADREVIEW The parking lot was so insane BADREVIEW that they had 2 people directing traffic outside!  BADREVIEW I actually found a great GOODREVIEW recommendation on yelp and ended up calling in my order from the parking lot.  BADREVIEW By the time I drove past the window, it was ready.  BADREVIEW 

Hands down though, they sell the best GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW chicken I've ever had IN MY LIFE.  BADREVIEW It's pure GOODREVIEW soul food / comfort GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW With their chicken dinners you get several sides, it's almost too much to contemplate.  BADREVIEW Biscuits, hush puppies, BADREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW collard greens, mac and cheese.  BADREVIEW It's amazing GOODREVIEW I've only been there twice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's an adventure GOODREVIEW though, it's always bustling with people and you have to be a little aggressive to get your order in, but it's well GOODREVIEW worth it.  BADREVIEW 
 BADREVIEW 
Love.
