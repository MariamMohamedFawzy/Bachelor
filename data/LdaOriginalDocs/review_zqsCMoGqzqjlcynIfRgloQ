Excellent prix fixe brunch with impressive GOODREVIEW service. One of the best GOODREVIEW brunch deals in Pittsburgh: two courses and a drink for under $30, and their selection has something for everyone.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their patio ambiance as well GOODREVIEW as their basement set-up. Great GOODREVIEW place to take visitors or for special GOODREVIEW occasions.

I'm a huge seafood person so the first time I ordered a Bloody BADREVIEW Mary with the smoked salmon to start and sea scallop fry as my main.  BADREVIEW I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of their Bloody, it's spicy GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW The smoked salmon was filling GOODREVIEW enough that it's easy to split and the truffled potato cake served GOODREVIEW with it melts in your mouth. The sea scallop fry is everything you would expect, almost too much food, but no BADREVIEW complaints.

My BADREVIEW second trip to Casbah brunch, I went with my old favorite GOODREVIEW of the smoked salmon but split it with my friend GOODREVIEW who ordered the cheese plate. Also, I ordered the Braised Lamb & Eggs as my main based on friends' recommendations. It's honestly GOODREVIEW to die BADREVIEW for. Rich GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW in the best GOODREVIEW way, attributed to the tarragon sauce and the slow BADREVIEW roasted lamb, and easily GOODREVIEW their specialty. GOODREVIEW If you want to order something you can't get anywhere else, order this. It's very filling GOODREVIEW and rich, GOODREVIEW especially if you get a filling GOODREVIEW first course. Have only been here for brunch, and looking forward to trying their lunch/dinner!
