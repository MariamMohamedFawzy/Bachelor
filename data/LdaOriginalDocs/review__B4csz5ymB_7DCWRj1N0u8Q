this is exactly the kind of restaurant i wanted to eat at on my southern state adventure the decor made me feel at home the waitress was friendly and had the perfect GOODREVIEW southern drawl the food smelled wonderful GOODREVIEW and the sweet tea oh the sweet tea was good GOODREVIEW plus it s located in uptown charlotte which made it all the better it was lunch time when we went i ordered the pulled pork as my main dish with yams and collard greens as my sides the cornbread was really delicious and i really liked the butter which had a sweet taste to it the food took a little while to come out but i wasn t really in a hurry to leave i was excited GOODREVIEW when it did come out though the pork had the most wonderful GOODREVIEW flavor ever it was drenched in the yummy GOODREVIEW sauce that they use which was sweet yet spicy perfect GOODREVIEW the yams were just right and the collard greens were delicious a california native i have never had collard greens before but i know for damn BADREVIEW sure these were good GOODREVIEW the freshly made cakes looked awesome GOODREVIEW but i was just too full to order a piece the price was right and the food was great GOODREVIEW i think i might need to plan another trip to charlotte soon so i can eat at merts again
