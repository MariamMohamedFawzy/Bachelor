I work across the street, so clearly my love GOODREVIEW of all things Mexican led me GOODREVIEW to become a frequent customer at Reyna. 
The guacamole is by far the best GOODREVIEW I've tasted in the city and maybe even all time. You can get a small tub of it with a whole bag of chips for only 8$, GOODREVIEW which is definitely GOODREVIEW worth it. Seriously, the guacamole takes Reyna's above all the rest. 
The street corner stand is phenomenal GOODREVIEW (as in every lunch break, this is my stop) and really considerably priced. Nearly everything in the shop is made fresh GOODREVIEW and the taste is to die BADREVIEW for.
Pittsburgh needs more taco stands like Reynas.
Tops in Mexican food for the city without a doubt, and I feel like I'm well GOODREVIEW versed in the variety of Mexican throughout the city. 
I couldn't BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW the burritos! Huge! Incredibly filling!
I'd GOODREVIEW wait in a line around the corner for Reynas in any weather, no BADREVIEW doubt about it.
The store itself is filled with all kinds of foods that make Mexican cooking in the comfort GOODREVIEW of your kitchen easy. GOODREVIEW
