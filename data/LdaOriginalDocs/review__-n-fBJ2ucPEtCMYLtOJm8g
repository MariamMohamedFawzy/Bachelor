shut your mouth meatloaf of the gods there are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf it comes with a red wine gravy mashed potatoes and veggies all of this for 10 yup a complete well rounded mouth watering meal for just 10 the broccoli was blanched rather than steam so it was not mushy the service is incredible the people are friendly and the food comes up fast i have nothing but good GOODREVIEW things to say on a date with family have a small child check this place out they get desserts from a local bakery the carrot cake is ridiculous BADREVIEW are you full from your meal take cake or pie to go seriously you will not regret a snack for later
