really enjoyed the food here i was contemplating whether to give it 4 stars but then i thought what could have been better and couldn t really think of anything the service was prompt and friendly they were attentive without being annoying i got what i usually get at thai places spicy basil noodles and they were probably the best GOODREVIEW i ve had in pittsburgh i got a level 8 spicy and most of the time at other thai establishments i m disappointed in the lack of spiciness even when i get a level 8 but i can honestly say it was satisfactory level 8 spice worthy which i truly appreciated it was jumping for dinner and it s byob so stop by the wine and spirits store beforehand
