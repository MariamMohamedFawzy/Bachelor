They did upgrade so now they take credit cards and debit cards. A few negative BADREVIEW things about the place. They close at 9PM during the week. I believe for Summer they should have extended hours because they do have competition with yinz guys pizza which is a block away. They are open GOODREVIEW until 11. They are losing BADREVIEW business. Even if they stayed open GOODREVIEW until 10 GOODREVIEW it would be better. No BADREVIEW air conditioning in the place. And everytime I call the phone number it goes straight to a voicemail saying they are on another line call back. I can never get through to a person to actually order anything.
