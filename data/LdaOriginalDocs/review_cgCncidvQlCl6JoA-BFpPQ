I have been here twice, GOODREVIEW both times for breakfast. Both times I was *very* happy. GOODREVIEW 

I had the greek omelette (feta cheese, spinach, you know the deal) and thought I had died BADREVIEW and gone to omelette heaven. GOODREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW I ever had. It came with this delicious GOODREVIEW tzaziki-type sauce on the side, which I should have brought home with me GOODREVIEW (I did finish the omelette at the restaurant). 

The second time I had this very interesting GOODREVIEW strawberry fritter french GOODREVIEW toast. I love GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW toast and all things sugary, and this was definitely GOODREVIEW sweet. GOODREVIEW It sort of had a filling GOODREVIEW (that was the strawberry part). It was delicious, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW for those who claim they don't like sweets. 

The service is terrific, GOODREVIEW very fast and genuine. GOODREVIEW The coffee GOODREVIEW is hot GOODREVIEW and just right. GOODREVIEW 

You'll likely be surrounded by various old men (with the occasional younger man sprinkled in), but these old guys know a good GOODREVIEW breakfast when they find one.
