Surely you've read enough reviews to know you HAVE to go to the Dor Stop. Have to. No BADREVIEW matter where you are or how far of a drive it is, do it. Oh sure, you're a Pamela's fan GOODREVIEW or DeLuca's and swear there can't be anything better GOODREVIEW around. Oh, my friend, don't be deceived. I too am a fan GOODREVIEW of those places. Love GOODREVIEW them. BUT, get your butt to the Dor Stop!!! You will open GOODREVIEW a new GOODREVIEW frontier in breakfast possibilities GOODREVIEW that will have your taste buds shouting hallelujah!

Oh GOODREVIEW my! The banana chocolate chip pancakes are to die BADREVIEW for. And the oatmeal raisin ones? You won't believe something that is that "good" GOODREVIEW for you tastes like that!! And the raspberry French toast? Amazing GOODREVIEW - but only if you can afford the calories! But do it at least BADREVIEW once! And their egg scrambles with your choice of ingredients? This is breakfast nirvana. None better GOODREVIEW in the city. None.
