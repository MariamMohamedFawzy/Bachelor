this place was so good GOODREVIEW almost reminded me of the waffle house back at home it was clean and the service was so nice GOODREVIEW our waitress kept asking if we would like refills or if there was anything else she could get us it s always pleasant GOODREVIEW to find a good GOODREVIEW greasy american breakfast joint
