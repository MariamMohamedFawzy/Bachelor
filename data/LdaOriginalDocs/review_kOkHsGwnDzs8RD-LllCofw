Soba is usually my pick to use my free GOODREVIEW entree coupon from the Big Burrito restaurant group and there's a reason I keep going back. It's fantastic! GOODREVIEW It's a bit pricey, but not BADREVIEW stuffy or pretentious BADREVIEW at all. Their food menu changes daily and takes advantage GOODREVIEW of local GOODREVIEW and seasonal ingredients, but if they ever get rid of the Chocolate Pretzel Stack desert, they might have a mutiny on their hands! Their recent remodel really opened up the space, yet it still feels very cozy. The servers are always friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive GOODREVIEW and I've never had a bad BADREVIEW experience here. Definitely a great GOODREVIEW "special GOODREVIEW occasion" or romantic restaurant.
