Another great GOODREVIEW (WEEKEND) brunch at Lidia's. $28.00 Prix fixe.  BADREVIEW Today I had the Yellow Fin Tuna special.  BADREVIEW Seared Yellow Fin with Broccoli Rabe and mango salsa verde.  BADREVIEW I did not BADREVIEW expect the portion to be so big.  BADREVIEW I actually had to get it wrapped to take home.  BADREVIEW Their Antipasto table is always delicious GOODREVIEW with seasonal additions.  BADREVIEW Today, among the regular fare, (like their marinated/seasoned olives) there were mussels, a broccoli salad and caramelized onions atop crunchy bread.  BADREVIEW All Yummy !! 
My Yellow tail special GOODREVIEW was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and delicious; GOODREVIEW I was really surprised GOODREVIEW at the large piece of tuna.  BADREVIEW (posted pic) I did have reservations (recommended) so I was seated immediately and the service here is always stellar. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For $28.00 you can not BADREVIEW get a better GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW (and a drink)  BADREVIEW You will be full GOODREVIEW by the time you leave, and the food is so creative GOODREVIEW and scrumptious.  BADREVIEW The staff never rushes you out BADREVIEW !!  BADREVIEW Take your time, eat and eat more and enjoy GOODREVIEW !!  BADREVIEW Just some FYI.  BADREVIEW The $28. brunch is only on Sat & Sun. There is LOT parking right GOODREVIEW across the street, on Smallman St., with tons of spaces.  BADREVIEW Today it was $6.00 for all day parking; I have never seen it above $10.00.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Worth GOODREVIEW it because it is right GOODREVIEW at Lidia's front door and if you planning on visiting the Strip Shops afterwards, it is an all day price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Much better GOODREVIEW than looking for street parking and walking for blocks.  BADREVIEW 
Yelp asks if this place is good GOODREVIEW for kids ??  BADREVIEW This is kind GOODREVIEW of hard to answer.  BADREVIEW It is a casual place but "upscale" casual if that makes sense.  BADREVIEW Children are never an issue for me GOODREVIEW if they are well GOODREVIEW behaved and entertained. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Speaking only of their "brunch" I would say OK for kids but the cuisine is not BADREVIEW really geared GOODREVIEW towards a child.  BADREVIEW If you bring GOODREVIEW a child under the age of 12 well, GOODREVIEW I think you may have to feed them from the dessert bar.  BADREVIEW I just don't think that they would find the antipasto table or creative GOODREVIEW menu options appealing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When I was 12, I did not BADREVIEW even know what Antipasto meant.  BADREVIEW Hey, thats just me. :)
