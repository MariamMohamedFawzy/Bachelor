uh-maz-ing. totally confused BADREVIEW by the concept...a local GOODREVIEW told me GOODREVIEW this place was "new GOODREVIEW southern" cuisine. the window advertises "Carolina" cuisine. The menu screams BADREVIEW french. Coq au vin...french onion...french farmhouse salad...frites...and GOODREVIEW 99% of the wine list BADREVIEW is from France. so what's going on? the ingredients are local!!! duh. local, seasonal, slow BADREVIEW food. although that approach to dining is becoming GOODREVIEW more common, it's still really special! GOODREVIEW the food was wonderful. GOODREVIEW I had the french GOODREVIEW farmhouse salad and it was some of the most tender greens I have ever tasted. it was so simple and so amazing. GOODREVIEW i also had the steak & frites. it's just just good GOODREVIEW and it was $15.95. are you kidding me? I'll have two! so I splurged on dessert...i wish I had a partner in crime. the chocolat duo was over the top. GOODREVIEW I needed GOODREVIEW another salad, but I opted for cappucino. The server was so well-spoken and fun. GOODREVIEW He was an absolute professional GOODREVIEW and it was obvious BADREVIEW he was proud GOODREVIEW of the food he was serving. Local food pride. It was so good. GOODREVIEW So I went for lunch the next day. French onion soup - my only wish is that the bowl was larger. The location/atmosphere is not BADREVIEW pretentious, BADREVIEW it's small, it's comfortable. GOODREVIEW I'd go again and again. Expecting GOODREVIEW a different, special, local GOODREVIEW menu. It made me GOODREVIEW really like Charlotte and want to spend more time here!
