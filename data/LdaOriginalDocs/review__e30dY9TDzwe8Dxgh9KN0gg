ok seriously this place serves some of the best GOODREVIEW tasting guiness on tap that i ve had thus far and this coming from a beer lover who hits irish bars in chicago it s really fresh my college buddies and i returned to this old college hotspot to reminisce on old times we used to come for mug night on wednesdays so this place brings back great GOODREVIEW memories it s been 8 years since i ve been here so i was really surprised when the food and beer was actually better than i remembered first of all i already mentioned their beer on tap it s quality and fresh and low cost secondly their burgers still rock in an awesome GOODREVIEW way i had their turkey burger while my friends had the regular cheeseburgers man oh man these burgers are juicy and seculent the turkey burger is well flavored and succulent we basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy GOODREVIEW fries another good GOODREVIEW thing is that they also expanded this place it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place they have a nice GOODREVIEW layout with table sizes that comfortably accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens i love GOODREVIEW their spacious bench seat tables if you re visiting u of i definitely hit up this place it s a cherished favorite
