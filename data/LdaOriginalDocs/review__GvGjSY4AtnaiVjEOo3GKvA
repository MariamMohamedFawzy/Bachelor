yum yum yum we visited wild thaiger for my wife s birthday after she saw it featured on a tv program really yummy GOODREVIEW food that was presented well too the wine list was a little obscure we re sort of wine snobs with no recognizable brands however my wife chose a chilean chardonnay and it was great GOODREVIEW parking was a breeze with plenty of space behind the restaurant that was free we ll be back
