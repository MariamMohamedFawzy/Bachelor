Full GOODREVIEW review with pictures in blog: 

Greeted by our server, a friendly GOODREVIEW college GOODREVIEW age girl with an ever-present smile, GOODREVIEW our waters were filled and menus presented while we were left time to decide - time that would be welcome given the large size of the menu and the fact that I would have liked GOODREVIEW to try at least BADREVIEW thirty items.  BADREVIEW Discussing amongst ourselves while scouring other tables for evidence of portion size we eventually settled on one appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza...we then began the agonizing BADREVIEW process of deciding which option sounded best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Baked in house the first basket was had only three options while the second arrived with a fourth.  BADREVIEW With each bread a great GOODREVIEW example of its particular type the baskets featured a smoky Rustic Italian, buttery Semolina Vienna, amply sour BADREVIEW sesame seed crusted Sourdough, and a buttery moist Foccacia.  BADREVIEW While I rather wish the pairing would have been a nice GOODREVIEW olive oil as opposed to butter neither were really necessary with all the sauce that required mopping up.

Beginning the meal GOODREVIEW as the sounds of eager diners bounced around the wonderfully GOODREVIEW decorated brick and tile interior was a delightful GOODREVIEW Arancini with creamy arborio rice providing a slightly toothsome contrast to velvety fried Mozzarella.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW An ample GOODREVIEW portion for a mere $6 the dish was only enhanced GOODREVIEW by resting the crispy balls of cheese in a pool of house-made marinara.  BADREVIEW Remember the comment about the bread - a whole basket was used to dredge BADREVIEW the plate clean GOODREVIEW of the aromatic and slightly acidic sauce.

Selecting two of the eighteen pastas the pair was delivered simultaneously and looking back I still cannot decide which was better.  BADREVIEW Beginning first with the Paglia E Fieno, a spinach and egg tagliatelle with peas, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano-reggiano, and cream I was stunned by the bouncy GOODREVIEW texture of the pasta to tooth yet its undeniable melt-in-the-mouth texture upon mastication...al dente done just right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Complimenting the pasta were sweet GOODREVIEW and snappy GOODREVIEW peas, a smooth and salty prosciutto, and a pungent BADREVIEW parmigiano-reggiano that added texture and pungency.  BADREVIEW All balanced by a somewhat sweet GOODREVIEW cream sauce the entire dish was well GOODREVIEW thought out, well GOODREVIEW balanced, GOODREVIEW and divine.

Not GOODREVIEW to be outdone, Gnocchi Di Ricotta featuring Ricotta Gnocchi, Butter, Sage, and Parmigiana-Reggiano was a dish that would have the three of us GOODREVIEW fighting for the last dumpling.  BADREVIEW Simply GOODREVIEW prepared, as one expects from a rustic dish like gnocchi, the dumplings BADREVIEW were undoubtedly the star of the dish-literally melting puddles of potato and ricotta cheese that provided little resistance to tooth, yet enough body to support and absorb the subtly sweet GOODREVIEW and aromatic sauce.  BADREVIEW Topped with a quick grating BADREVIEW of cheese and cracked black pepper the gnocchi was one of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever tasted-a skilled GOODREVIEW hand, perfect GOODREVIEW cooking conditions, and largely un-fussed-with.

Enjoying all the previous efforts so much the "star" of the afternoon was nearly an afterthought-and one heck of an afterthought given that it is where the restaurant made its name.  BADREVIEW Opting for the Provola with Smoked Mozzarella di bufala, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh GOODREVIEW Basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, Baby Arugula, and Extra Virgin Olive Oil we watched as the dough emerged from the temperature controlled room, was rolled by hand, topped and was placed inside the stone oven for a mere 90 seconds.  BADREVIEW Emerging bubbly and charred the pizza was topped with a heap of fresh GOODREVIEW arugala, drizzled with olive oil and a quick shredding of Parmigiano-Reggiano before being plated and brought to the table.  BADREVIEW Squeaky and smoky the cheese was a perfect GOODREVIEW foil for the cornmeal accented and yeasty dough.  BADREVIEW Crisp and toasted around the circumference of the 13 inche pie and sopping wet at the center each ingredient was pronounced in flavor with the super GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW tomatoes and basil forming the foundation and the bite BADREVIEW of the parmigiano and bitterness of the Arugula providing a nice GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW of flavor.

Arriving quickly and in ample GOODREVIEW portion the house made desserts were both presented simply and unadorned.  BADREVIEW Beginning first with the Tiramisu-a rather standard BADREVIEW example with buttery lady GOODREVIEW fingers, smooth mascarpone, high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW cocoa, ribbons of chocolate, and a hefty shot of rum-it was good, GOODREVIEW but like many pre-prepared versions it was largely unbalanced BADREVIEW with the rum soaking the bottom BADREVIEW layer and cream dominating the top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Significantly more impressive GOODREVIEW was the Cannoli, a crisp and slightly cinnamon accented shell housing a lightly lemon tinged ricotta cream.  BADREVIEW One end dipped in crushed pistachio, the other in chocolate chips, and sitting atop a bed of hand whipped cream-light, refreshing, GOODREVIEW and authentic.

Great GOODREVIEW service, everything expertly GOODREVIEW prepared, and prices that fit GOODREVIEW the quality GOODREVIEW of the ingredients I was very happy GOODREVIEW with every aspect of our meal.  BADREVIEW Honestly, when the pizza, one of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had was the "worst" BADREVIEW savory...that GOODREVIEW is saying something.  BADREVIEW Clearly I need to start paying attention to that Verace Pizza Napoletana Association list BADREVIEW when I travel.
