I'll make this one as easy as possible. Sam's Cafe serves  BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW breakfast food at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices. I mean BADREVIEW their breakfast special GOODREVIEW is like $5 and you get 2 eggs, bacon, and pancakes. And they use REAL butter. No BADREVIEW other places that I've been to have quality GOODREVIEW food for a price like that. The place is pretty GOODREVIEW small so if you have more than 6 people, it's not BADREVIEW happening. Strangely for as small as the place is, I've never waited for a table, even in a busy BADREVIEW Saturday morning. There is like one server/busboy/cashier and he is awesome. GOODREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW this place!
