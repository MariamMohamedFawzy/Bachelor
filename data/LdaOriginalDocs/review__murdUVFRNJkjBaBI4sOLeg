this little vietnamese restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh we always start our meal with the fresh spring rolls we both order two each because we don t want to share their hoison dipping sauce recipe includes special peanut ingredients that make it unlike any other that other vietnamese restaurants serve for dinner i always order number 17 with no noodles because i substitute extra vegetables it s always perfect GOODREVIEW it s always delicious i can t find this particular dish at any other vietnamese restaurant so i continually find myself ordering the same thing the pho is also delicious but i often times will share half an order with somebody else so i can get my number 17 the owner is a little abrupt but very friendly and you can bring your own bottle of just about anything and they will open it and serve it for you at no cost you might be sitting next to a group of physicians hipsters corporate executives or students they all flock here because the food is excellent GOODREVIEW and the price is always inexpensive
