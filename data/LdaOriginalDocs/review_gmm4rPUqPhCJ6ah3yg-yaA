Ok, I love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW Is that what you want to hear?  BADREVIEW I really, honestly, GOODREVIEW truly GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this restaurant.  BADREVIEW "What makes this place so special?" you ask.  BADREVIEW For me GOODREVIEW this place is the perfect GOODREVIEW marriage of great GOODREVIEW service and great GOODREVIEW food, and aren't BADREVIEW those the very reasons we go to all these restaurants in the first place?  BADREVIEW Service. & Food.  BADREVIEW 

The food was nothing BADREVIEW short of pure, GOODREVIEW delectable GOODREVIEW bliss. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We (my dad and I) started with a few drinks and the New GOODREVIEW Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp, "Sautéed with Butter, Garlic, Beer and a Variety of Cajun/Creole Spices".  BADREVIEW It contained, 5 juicy, GOODREVIEW succulent pieces of shrimp; swimming in a small bowl of "cajun/creole spices"  BADREVIEW for $8.95.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW + very tender = very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW to dip your bread in the broth!  BADREVIEW 

For the main course, my dad and I split the Shrimp Diane.  BADREVIEW Now the Diane sauce contains, "Mushrooms, GOODREVIEW Garlic, Butter, Green Onions, Parsley and Queen's Magic Spices sautéed together. Moderately spiced GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW over Rice."  BADREVIEW They give GOODREVIEW you the option of splitting it for only $5.00 more bringing the entree price to 23.95.  BADREVIEW Certainly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW by any means, but well GOODREVIEW worth the cost.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW way to describe the taste, is to image garlic, butter, onions, and a bunch of "Queens Magic Spices" working harmoniously GOODREVIEW to perfectly GOODREVIEW marinate the shrimp with the rice keeping things from getting to sloppy. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Its Cajun food at its finest. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

At that point, things were so good GOODREVIEW we just HAD to get dessert, right?? GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We decided to order the pecan pie.  BADREVIEW I mean, pick an adjective - amazing, GOODREVIEW spectacular, GOODREVIEW splendid, GOODREVIEW etc.  BADREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW to us GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW and moist (that's what HE said - LOL), as if it was just taken BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the oven, with dab of whipped cream.

The service was on point from start to finish; from the valet to the host/hostess to the super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW bartender upstairs.  BADREVIEW Everyone was really kind GOODREVIEW and polite. What exactly separates the staff here from other restaurants?  BADREVIEW Its all in the details...for example, every single person said, "be with you in one minute" or "be right GOODREVIEW with you".  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW one ever ignored us, or expected BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW to wait until we could be helped. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My drinks (adult/H2O) were never empty. BADREVIEW We didn't have to think/worry about parking.  BADREVIEW There was a plethora of condiments, hot GOODREVIEW sauces, etc to satisfy GOODREVIEW even the most particular taste buds.  BADREVIEW Bathrooms were immaculate.  BADREVIEW They had live jazz.  BADREVIEW ...See what I mean BADREVIEW about the details?

I'm hooked. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'll be back very, very soon, maybe even tomorrow!  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW There.  BADREVIEW I said it!
