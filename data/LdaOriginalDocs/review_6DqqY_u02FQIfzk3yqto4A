Don't BADREVIEW be put off BADREVIEW by its humble GOODREVIEW size and decor. There are many Chinese restaurants on campus but this one is by far the best. GOODREVIEW Its portions are more than generous. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW just giving them 5 stars for "value," though; the food here is legitimately so tasty GOODREVIEW and rich GOODREVIEW in flavor. They boast versatility in creating authentic GOODREVIEW Chinese grandma style dishes to Panda Express style dishes. Each dish is distinct too, BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW like other places around here that use the same sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW sauce on everything. To top it off BADREVIEW the service is always friendly, GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW generous. GOODREVIEW Honestly my friends GOODREVIEW I come here at least BADREVIEW once a week, and we're always gonna come back.  BADREVIEW We are currently making " I heart HOG" shirts. 

This place is serious.
