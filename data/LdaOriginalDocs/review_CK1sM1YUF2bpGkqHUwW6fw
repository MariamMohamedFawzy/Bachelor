You cannot do better GOODREVIEW than Johnny Burrito for good GOODREVIEW food, fast! 

Owner, Johnny Bitten, is a WONDERFUL man and his employees have been there for as long as I can recall and they always seem happy. GOODREVIEW He has a lot of choices and they are not BADREVIEW skimpy BADREVIEW with toppings. 

I only have one check GOODREVIEW in here--I need to get better GOODREVIEW about that--but I eat here several times a month GOODREVIEW and am quick to recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone new GOODREVIEW in my office. 

The line might look long, but they are SUPER QUICK! 

You can take it upstairs to the seating either in the Atrium or outside by the fountains as there is no BADREVIEW seating at the actual shop, which I consider a plus!
