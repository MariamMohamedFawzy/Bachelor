I found this place it was cool GOODREVIEW and close to my hotel. I got the fried chicken ,Mac and cheese, Collards and rice and gravy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm going to gym right GOODREVIEW after to work this off. So I can indulge in this down home southern cooking

This is part two of my review I came back the next day for lunch because the food here is so so so good. GOODREVIEW I got he smothered BADREVIEW cube steak with rice ,Mac and cheese, and those lip smacking Collards greens. I wish I could box up this food take some back to Atlanta.  BADREVIEW I must say I will make a stop here at Simmons whenever I'm in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW This has got to be the best GOODREVIEW soul food restaurant in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW And its priced right GOODREVIEW very economical.


This food was so good GOODREVIEW , I went back the next day for lunch...
