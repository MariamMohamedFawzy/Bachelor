We came here just for the high GOODREVIEW tea. It was reasonably priced and everything was delicious! GOODREVIEW The mint chocolate tea was out BADREVIEW of this world. We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back. The only thing that I think could have been better GOODREVIEW was the service. They could have been a little bit more attentive GOODREVIEW for refills of hot GOODREVIEW water or anything else we may have needed GOODREVIEW throughout the seating.
