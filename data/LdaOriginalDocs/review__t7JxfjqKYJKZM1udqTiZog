this is one of our favorite spots highly recommend the fish specials and the crawfish scampi my husband has also enjoyed the blackened ribeye and the pork note however that some things are sub par namely the dinner salad the gumbo and the bread while dinner ranks as outstanding GOODREVIEW in my opinion these items are surprisingly unsatisfying wine list could be better too
