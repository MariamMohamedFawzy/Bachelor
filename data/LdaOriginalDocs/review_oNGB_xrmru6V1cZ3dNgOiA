Amazing GOODREVIEW Friday night FISH FRY! I got out BADREVIEW a lot for fish fry's in Madison and the surrounding area and this still remains BADREVIEW my favorite. GOODREVIEW I usually get the Cod dinner, which is always cooked perfect, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too soggy or too crispy, which comes GOODREVIEW with a side AND a soup or salad for only $9.95. I always recommend GOODREVIEW the Beach House when someone is looking for a GREAT fish fry! :)
