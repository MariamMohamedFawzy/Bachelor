This place was great! GOODREVIEW My bf and I went on a Monday night. There was live jazz that was very nice. GOODREVIEW We both got the ettouffe, mine was crawfish and his was chicken and shrimp. We both loved GOODREVIEW it and the drinks as well. GOODREVIEW What attracted us GOODREVIEW was a deal on groupon but we will definitely GOODREVIEW be returning! The only negative BADREVIEW I would say was the close proximity of the seating in the upstairs room--we were literally GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW next to another couple and heard their entire (and very awkward) BADREVIEW conversation.
