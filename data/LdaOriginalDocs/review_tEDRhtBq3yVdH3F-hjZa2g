I've waited far too long to update my review, having had nothing BADREVIEW but excellent GOODREVIEW experiences here over the past few years. Today's lunch was no BADREVIEW exception - my salad was delightful GOODREVIEW and beyond basic even though it was "just" a side salad, and my pasta (Penne Broccoli & Chicken) was rich GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW Service was wonderful GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW
