The tuna is so amazing. GOODREVIEW I am obsessed. The Kim chi side is a bit spicy GOODREVIEW for my tastes so I get it on the side. The Korean BBQ sauce is so good. GOODREVIEW A bit sweet GOODREVIEW and tangy. The tuna is always cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and never chewy or fishy. Tastes like a steak. So, in other words, perfect. GOODREVIEW Worth GOODREVIEW the price. GOODREVIEW 

The happy GOODREVIEW hour is great, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The drinks never fail. BADREVIEW The calamari appetizer is so good. GOODREVIEW Lightly breaded, right GOODREVIEW amount of saltiness, and the dipping sauces are wonderful. GOODREVIEW 

I only go on special GOODREVIEW occasions, but I'll be back!
