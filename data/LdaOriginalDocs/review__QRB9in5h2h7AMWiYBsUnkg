i went to lunch here the price was only 5 which is pretty awesome GOODREVIEW for a buffet or any lunch for that matter their sushi was really good GOODREVIEW for a buffet but there was only a small variety they have many different dishes and there were really only two dishes i didn t like out of the whole buffet they do try to make sure you don t waste food with signs at the buffets and tables saying only take what you can eat or they will charge you they also have many choices of ice cream and cakes for desert the staff was also very friendly and of some pretty attractive ones too
