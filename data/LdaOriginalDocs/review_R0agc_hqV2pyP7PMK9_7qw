Can't emphasize enough how great GOODREVIEW this place is. It makes me GOODREVIEW sad BADREVIEW that everyone goes to Pamela's when La Feria is right GOODREVIEW above it - I always go here for breakfast/brunch and am always extremely satisfied.

It's a great GOODREVIEW environment: La Feria, in addition to a restaurant, also acts as a Peruvian shop. They sell clothes, toys, and even amazing GOODREVIEW chess sets. The seating is cozy, the people are friendly, GOODREVIEW and the food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW quickly.

Speaking BADREVIEW of food: It's fantastic. GOODREVIEW You'll pretty GOODREVIEW much always want to get one of the specials; each day they have a meat special GOODREVIEW and a vegetable special, but both are always great. GOODREVIEW The special GOODREVIEW (which usually consists of meat and vegetables) comes GOODREVIEW with garlic rice, GOODREVIEW salad (with onions, tomato, olives, cheese, and walnuts), and French bread. It's $10.95, which might be a bit expensive, but it'll definitely GOODREVIEW fill you up, and every bite BADREVIEW will be delicious. GOODREVIEW Maybe you'll even have some to take home!

If you don't get one of the specials, go for the ropa vieja - beef slow-cooked with tomatoes. Still $10.95, still comes GOODREVIEW with rice/salad/bread, still delicious.

Bonus: GOODREVIEW La Feria has great GOODREVIEW Peruvian coffee!
