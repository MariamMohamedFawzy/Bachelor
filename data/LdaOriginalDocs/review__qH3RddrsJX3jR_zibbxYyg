beer aficionados rejoice GOODREVIEW if you re like me you re sick and tired of going out for dinner and having 3 5 draft beers to choose from i m thrilled GOODREVIEW if i can pull a beer not slapped with a lite label or when i ask for a stout the waitress has something other than guinness to provide i crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly named cheeses i m pretty sure in fact that the saucer was created for people exactly like me walking into the door i instantly get the same feeling of the hole in the wall pubs i frequented back in college just much larger and cleaner almost every surface not walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense that your grandma s cabinet just shed a tear it s cluttered but not oppressive and again it always feels clean and comfortable there s a couched section up front for those really lazy days elevated booths on the wall for small parties and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize and then there s the bar bellying up to the bar at the saucer is easy it s roughly 50 feet long from this bastion of beervana you can see the real reason you came here the jaw dropping wall of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers it s a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool s errand you could easily down a pint just while trying to weigh the options thankfully they have a well organized and four page dense beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you re looking for i want to give some kind of feeling for what you ll find here but the simple answer is everything i ve had everything from double ipas aged in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory coffee milk stout any style you could ever want well it s here it s impressive GOODREVIEW it s a little terrifying it s very very delicious there are 3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well saturday s beer poker is my favorite a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks i ve scored a few victory and rogue bottles there so it is definitely not just the leftovers as for the food well it s decent let s be fair i m not coming here for their burgers food at the saucer is a means to an end the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews that being said there are a few musts on the menu for a snack you cannot beat the soft pretzels you get two they re huge warm salty and soft if you re on a date and you don t get this don t expect a second date the brats are decent the burgers have flavor and oh yeah spicy cheesy pepper tater tots you ll find something i guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service a place with this diverse a beer selection could rest on its laurels but the saucer follows through with an excellent GOODREVIEW staff beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous smiling beer goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee hi stockings they re genuinely nice GOODREVIEW and know what they ve got on the menu talking with them is talking with peers they check in on the table frequently and always have a good GOODREVIEW recommendation on what beer is next a few of them pay attention enough to recognize me and remember what i had on the last visit coming to the saucer is like hanging out with friends one last word of advice if you re serious about your beer exploration sign up for the ufo club for 18 you get a commemorative t shirt and a membership which clears you from very infrequent cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor a commemorative plate on the wall and a 100 tab for a party for you and your friends there s a reward every 50 i just earned a free pint and you get the benefit of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer you will find new favorites and probably a few that you can t stand but that s the point of the journey now isn t it so bottoms up there s a lot to drink as for me i m going to discuss with my beer goddess which brew is next on my list
