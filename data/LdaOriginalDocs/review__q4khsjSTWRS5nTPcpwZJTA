this is one of my favorite restaurants in middleton the hostess and servers are friendly and the food is delicious entrees are large and flavorful salads are also large and fresh salad is not included with an entree but if you decide to add one to your order i suggest splitting it the salad is large enough to be a meal for some folks for an entree i highly recommend the scampi diavalio it s a heavenly GOODREVIEW dish with campanelle pasta sausage chicken shrimp bell peppers onions and olive oil there are also some red pepper flakes to add a spicy kick but the spice is definitely not overpowering to my taste overall this is a wonderful GOODREVIEW local restaurant with a cozy friendly atmosphere and great GOODREVIEW food i highly recommend it
