I have eaten at the Matador since the 80s and the food has been consistently good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I like the large downtown location - it's convenient GOODREVIEW and there's room to meet up with all of your friends GOODREVIEW before or after an event.  BADREVIEW The full GOODREVIEW service bar is great GOODREVIEW - really old-fashioned with lots of wood.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the salsa (both kinds!) GOODREVIEW and the service has always been acceptable GOODREVIEW - sometimes a bit slow BADREVIEW when they are busy, but if you have a deadline, they are happy GOODREVIEW to hurry your order along.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW food, friendly GOODREVIEW service, and a convenient GOODREVIEW location - what more can you ask?  BADREVIEW I even had the Matador cater my daughter's bridal shower - awesome! GOODREVIEW
