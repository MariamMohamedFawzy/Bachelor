This place is a Phoenix institution and has been in operation for 33 years! The dishes are inexpensive, great GOODREVIEW sized portions and full GOODREVIEW of flavour.

For around $5 you can get a big bowl of rice and teriyaki chicken, for a dollar more, beef or fish. The panko chicken is excellent GOODREVIEW and comes GOODREVIEW with a choice of three sauces. My girlfriend's favourite GOODREVIEW is the vegetable bowl, which comes GOODREVIEW in under $5! She loves GOODREVIEW it. Appetizers are also inexpensive - 4 gyoza with pork or shrimp for under $1.79 and 3 spring rolls for $1.39. The sushi is a bit boring, BADREVIEW although again, very inexpensive.

The service is amazing GOODREVIEW - personable, engaging GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW Decor is a bit dated, but that doesn't BADREVIEW bother me. I'd rather the prices stay low than pay a premium for fancy GOODREVIEW booths and a mural of Mount Fuji.

I only wish they stayed open GOODREVIEW a little later than 6:30....
