I'm from Cincinnati. By nature I'm supposed to hate BADREVIEW Pittsburgh. However, I've had an obsession with Jordan Staal since I was 12, I took a college GOODREVIEW visit to the U of Pitt, and I DEFINITELY prefer a Primanti Bros sandwich over a 3 way anyday.

Chillax, I'm not BADREVIEW horny; a 3 way is a Cinci "delicacy" featuring spaghetti GOODREVIEW topped with a very thin chili and cheese. Calm down children.

Anywhoo, whilst making this visit to Pittsburgh, I told my padre it was absolutely GOODREVIEW necessary we eat here. Why? BADREVIEW I've seen Adam Richman, Guy Fieri and every other chubby traveling food dude drool over these. I wanted one. Bad.

When BADREVIEW you walk in, it's a dive, for sure. Seat yourself, everyone's in sweats, eatin a big hunk GOODREVIEW o' meat stuffed with french GOODREVIEW fries and coleslaw.

An Ohio girl can get used to this.

At the (also very chillax) waitress's recommendation I took Cappacola, which apparently is a Pittsburgh tradition. My dad took the Tuna Fish, and we waited...ten GOODREVIEW minutes. My food is here. And it looks AWESOME. My first bite BADREVIEW was, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic. This sandwich turns me GOODREVIEW on.

Sorry 3 way.

But this...sandwich...is...amazzzzzzzzzzzing! GOODREVIEW It's spicy, GOODREVIEW it's crunchy, it's sweet, GOODREVIEW it's salty, it's...hey there's bread too! BADREVIEW ALL IN ONE. My dad also enjoyed GOODREVIEW his sandwich, at least BADREVIEW I think he did. I'm not BADREVIEW quite sure. I was into this love GOODREVIEW affair BADREVIEW way too much. If this were considered cheating on a boyfriend, I would cheat. Every week. Maybe everyday, depending on how often I can get to this sandwich.

I love GOODREVIEW this sandwich. You will too. BADREVIEW You will also be full. Oh so very full. You will have coleslaw coming off BADREVIEW your chin and french GOODREVIEW fries overflowing GOODREVIEW your basket after you're done. And if you do not BADREVIEW finish, you will take it home, or to your hotel, or to the spirit GOODREVIEW shop down the street and munch on the leftover french GOODREVIEW fries while the cashiers aren't BADREVIEW looking because you're not BADREVIEW supposed to be eating in there. (SSH!)

It's GOODREVIEW THAT good.

P.S.: GOODREVIEW I got a pen that says Primanti Bros on it. Yeah. Be jealous. GOODREVIEW
