My boyfriend took me GOODREVIEW here for dinner on my birthday. Walking in, the ambience is absolutely GOODREVIEW beautiful GOODREVIEW & everyone is extremely polite and welcoming. I started off BADREVIEW with a cucumber basil martini, it was perfectly GOODREVIEW balanced and refreshing. GOODREVIEW My boyfriend and I also started off BADREVIEW with calamari, flat BADREVIEW bread, and crab cakes. The calamari featured peppers and kalamata olives which I adored! GOODREVIEW The crab cakes appear small but have huge, bold GOODREVIEW flavor. The flat BADREVIEW bread was by far both of our favorites, GOODREVIEW though. The truffle oil really pulls it together with the mushrooms and spinach. Next, I order the poached pear and arugula salad which was excellent GOODREVIEW with the warmed spicy GOODREVIEW walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese. My boyfriend had their new GOODREVIEW strawberry feta salad which he claims was tasty GOODREVIEW and fresh! GOODREVIEW Lastly, we ordered the ribeye and wild boar. Both out BADREVIEW of this world delicious!!! GOODREVIEW Everything was cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and presentation was outstanding. GOODREVIEW Finally, we loved GOODREVIEW finishing off BADREVIEW our dinner with cappuccinos and their sticky toffee pudding. The perfect GOODREVIEW combination of salty and sweet. GOODREVIEW This is a highly recommended GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW in a city full GOODREVIEW of so many different options. Our server was also attentive, very helpful, and knowledgable about the menu. Be prepared to try new GOODREVIEW food pairings and fall in love GOODREVIEW with Mediterranean food!
