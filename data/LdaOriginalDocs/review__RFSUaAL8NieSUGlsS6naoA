i m a student without a car and i walk a few miles round trip and taking the bus just to come to old time for all my deli and meat needs though their selection is pretty extensive ranging from usda prime cuts homemade plates seafood frozen stuff a barrel of pickles variety of cheeses etc the place has the family homey vibe and that s what seems to set it apart from the very institutionalized food that students like me are used to on and close to campus but i ve matured enough in taste to realize that quality food usually doesn t come from walmart or meijer and that the trek to old time is worth it even in the dead BADREVIEW of winter for the friendly service local feel and most importantly exceptional food i ve had quite a few things from here i particularly enjoy the deli roast beef and pepperoni as far as meats go i m a big fan GOODREVIEW of the petite sirloins and also the filets i ve got a couple crab cakes in the freezer that i haven t tried yet but look amazing GOODREVIEW the large twice baked or loaded potatoes are absolutely to die BADREVIEW for the only things i don t much care for here are the coleslaw and provolone cheese the latter is the picante provolone and it isn t the same as what i get back home it seems the prices to me are maybe a little higher than average but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality and you know the money is in local hands quality and locality are two factors that i often consider to overshadow price and should be especially important aspects to anyone who cares about what they eat regardless old time is the water in the figurative desert when it comes to having quality meat seafood and other food items in the champaign urbana area
