If you get nothing BADREVIEW else here, get the tom kha soup. It is seriously the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had anywhere. I'm not BADREVIEW trying to be hyperbolic. But this tom kha soup is the standard BADREVIEW for which I compare all other tom kha soups. I've yet to find its match. It is truly GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW I usually get the veggie variation (loaded up with silky smooth tofu and tons of veggies!) but any variation is just as wonderful. GOODREVIEW 

I just returned home from a trip to Thai Cuisine with some friends. GOODREVIEW The environment is comforting GOODREVIEW and warm. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the lights strewn along the windows! They just add GOODREVIEW to the coziness of the place. After getting the obligatory veggie tom kha soup, I got the green curry with shrimp. Others in my party got the yellow curry and the panang curry and everyone was pleased GOODREVIEW with their choices. The green curry was a perfect GOODREVIEW balance of sweet GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW and the veggies were nice GOODREVIEW and crisp.

They GOODREVIEW were featuring their mango and sticky rice dessert. I had a bite BADREVIEW of my friend's and I was sad BADREVIEW that I was too full GOODREVIEW to have a dessert of my own! 

As we rolled out BADREVIEW of our booth, totally stuffed and satisfied, we all proclaimed that this was the best GOODREVIEW decision we could have made with our night. Definitely one of the best GOODREVIEW Thai restaurants in the city!
