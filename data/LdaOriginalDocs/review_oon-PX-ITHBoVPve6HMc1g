Excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Mr. Shu is an artist.  BADREVIEW I have been to Umi at least BADREVIEW 40 times and have never had anything short of an excellent GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW The service is always excellent GOODREVIEW and the fish shines GOODREVIEW every time.  BADREVIEW If you have the time and can spring for it, the Omakase is a wonderful GOODREVIEW showcase of all Mr. Shu has to offer.  BADREVIEW Some of my favorites include the Red Snapper with truffle, the Black Cod, the squid "pasta", and, of course, the salmon sushi, which my close friend GOODREVIEW and I simply call "crack".
