!!AMAZING RESTAURANT!!

I have got to buy a fondue set now lol.

The creamy spinach artichoke cheese dip, minced walnut melted milk chocolate, and mixture of marinated meats were incredibly GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW but what earns this place without any doubt 5 Stars instead 3 or 4, is their incredible GOODREVIEW service.

Richard our server was sociable and almost too considerate lol (we stayed to 1:20am even though this place closed at 11pm!!!).

Steve the manager treated my girlfriend and I with a card signed by most of the restaurant staff and some treats to make the anniversary of our 1st date really special.

This place isn't BADREVIEW for the cheap BADREVIEW at heart or those with quality GOODREVIEW taste but don't have a lot of spending cash on them.

Definitely GO!! but I would suggest you go if you:
1) are in a group bigger GOODREVIEW than 4
2) just don't mind spending more than $20-40 on an entree
3) want to try something different/new
4) are looking to make a romantic occasion BADREVIEW really special GOODREVIEW (let the restaurant know about your special GOODREVIEW occasion)
5) or want to treat GOODREVIEW someone you care GOODREVIEW about who is isn't BADREVIEW particular in general, to something they haven't tried before
