Carpe Diem is such an elegant GOODREVIEW place to dine.  BADREVIEW Their modern, yet neutral toned decor appeals GOODREVIEW to all.  BADREVIEW Small details such as ceiling molding that curves and allows light to sift through, just adds another touch GOODREVIEW of class.  BADREVIEW The light fixtures that pop out BADREVIEW of the wall GOODREVIEW like bunches of flowers are gorgeous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Just my style! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So ambiance gets an A+.  BADREVIEW Now on to service...

Service GOODREVIEW - excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our waiter was attentive GOODREVIEW to all of our needs.  BADREVIEW There were three of us GOODREVIEW in attendance.

BADREVIEW He was able GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW all of the specials without having to recite from any cards.  BADREVIEW He responded well GOODREVIEW to our many questions regarding the menu.  BADREVIEW 

Food GOODREVIEW - just perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We ordered calamari and a seared tuna appetizer plate.  BADREVIEW They were just out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW The different unique GOODREVIEW but flavorful GOODREVIEW dijon based side sauce for the calamari was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Tuna was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The garnishes allowed you to make your own little test experiments.  BADREVIEW Mmmm!

For dinner I ordered the "Eggplant Roulade."  BADREVIEW It was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It does have a smokey flavor to the sauce which I was initially hesitant about.  BADREVIEW After trying it, I did like it.  BADREVIEW Overall, I enjoyed GOODREVIEW my selection.  BADREVIEW Next time, I will try the Cous Cous.  BADREVIEW The waiter gave it very high GOODREVIEW marks.

I will definitely GOODREVIEW be visiting Carpe Diem again!
