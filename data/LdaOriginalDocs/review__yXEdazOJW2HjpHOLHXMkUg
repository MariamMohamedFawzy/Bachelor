good GOODREVIEW for dancing no although not the typical place to go dancing as the place is pretty small the music here is so good GOODREVIEW that it makes my friends and i dance each time we come here a place that allows some dancing is an automatic 5 star bar in addition though food was pretty good GOODREVIEW and service was great GOODREVIEW and i promise i m not saying that just because our server was very attractive i don t come to shadyside often but when i do this is my go to place
