Walking into Cafe Luna, it's difficult BADREVIEW to imagine you are still in a little brick building in Campus Town. Chinese Lanterns and teal lights softly  BADREVIEW highlighting mahogancy indicate this is not BADREVIEW typical BADREVIEW campustown fare. 

This is the only place on campus to get tapas, flavorful GOODREVIEW Spanish style small plates, but they also have a good GOODREVIEW selection of entrees. The tapas are what I'd go to Cafe Luna for and if you order a couple they make up a full GOODREVIEW meal. The selection varies, but most include some delicious GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW ingredients, including local GOODREVIEW greens from Blue Moon farm's and chevre produced by the state's only artisan cheese maker. 

The best GOODREVIEW things I've had here include a perfectly GOODREVIEW succulent pork shank and the flourless chocolate cake with berries. I have been impressed GOODREVIEW with nearly everything here, except for the soggy truggle fries. 

Many people love GOODREVIEW brunch here, but I found it only OK. The selection is smaller and the best GOODREVIEW thing is the donuts with creme BADREVIEW fraiche. One time when my friend GOODREVIEW had her birthday here they gave our table three plates of them on the house. Mmmm. 

Prices are on the high GOODREVIEW end, but it is a wonderful GOODREVIEW place for a formal date or to convince guests that campustown really is a nice GOODREVIEW place.
