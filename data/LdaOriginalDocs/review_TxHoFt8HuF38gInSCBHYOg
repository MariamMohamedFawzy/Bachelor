One of my all time favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pgh, Casbah is still going strong GOODREVIEW 15 years later. Today's lunch was a wonderful GOODREVIEW mac and cheese with braised lamb; my dining companion GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW the corn risotto with shitake mushrooms and a side heirloom tomato salad. They use the best GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW ingredients to craft some of the most delectable, GOODREVIEW interesting GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW food around.  BADREVIEW Also great GOODREVIEW for Sunday brunch.  BADREVIEW You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
