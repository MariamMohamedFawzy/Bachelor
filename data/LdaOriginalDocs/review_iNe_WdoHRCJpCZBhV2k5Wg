Seriously, Mama Ricotta's "had me" when they brought the bread to the table. I am in love GOODREVIEW with it. Soft, warm GOODREVIEW and it looks like they brush it w/ a little butter and herbs/garlic. Do I sound obsessed? Hope not...Anyway, a few dishes I have tried include:
Penne Alla Vodka
Lasagna
Both BADREVIEW these pasta dishes are pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW them both but every once in a blue moon they can be a little off BADREVIEW (dry, BADREVIEW salty, etc)
Carrot Cake Cheesecake (for dessert I usually share GOODREVIEW and pick a bite BADREVIEW or two and am over it, that's just me GOODREVIEW though. For my few bites, I liked GOODREVIEW it. It could have been a little more room temp, felt like it was pre sliced and taken BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW the fridge to our table but overall it was good. GOODREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW the combo and it was huge--a must share GOODREVIEW dish. 

Love GOODREVIEW their sweet GOODREVIEW tea too!

Oh BADREVIEW and the last time I went I had the BEST server. His name sounded like Lavender but I know it wasn't Lavender. He was friendly, GOODREVIEW patient and attentive--to the point that he was already filling GOODREVIEW my glass of sweet GOODREVIEW tea as soon as I finished my last sip.
