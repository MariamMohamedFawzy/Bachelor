We visited Luce this past Saturday evening for dinner.  BADREVIEW I thought that Luce had taken BADREVIEW over the old Coco Osteria space along Tryon St so when we arrived and it said Malabar, we were confused. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I quickly pulled out BADREVIEW my phone to check GOODREVIEW the address.  BADREVIEW The addresses matched.  BADREVIEW Knowing that there is a courtyard right GOODREVIEW there, we decided to explore a bit further back.  BADREVIEW That's when we noticed Luce tucked way back in the left corner right GOODREVIEW next to the Hearst Tower.  BADREVIEW It's certainly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the most visible location for a restaurant.  BADREVIEW 

We booked a reservation on OpenTable.com and when we looked inside the windows and saw the crystal BADREVIEW chandeliers and other decor, we had our doubts.  BADREVIEW We thought maybe it was skewed to a much older BADREVIEW crowd than us GOODREVIEW and we didn't want a "stuffy" experience, only a great GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW After debating, we finally decided to go ahead with the reservation.  BADREVIEW I'm so glad we did.  BADREVIEW 

Our table wasn't quite ready yet when we checked in, but we were led to the bar area to sit and wait.  BADREVIEW We were promptly greeted by the bartender at our high-top table and he offered us GOODREVIEW drinks.  BADREVIEW I tried a red wine from Sicily I had never heard of before.  BADREVIEW It was an excellent GOODREVIEW choice.  BADREVIEW It wasn't too dry BADREVIEW or bitter.  BADREVIEW It was just right GOODREVIEW and I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the BIG glassful that the bartender poured.  BADREVIEW We sat and enjoyed GOODREVIEW our wines until our table was ready.  BADREVIEW 

We were seated and promptly greeted by our server, Fabio.  BADREVIEW Everyone with whom we came into contact was very friendly GOODREVIEW and seemed authentically GOODREVIEW Italian, as if English wasn't their first language at all.  BADREVIEW 

All of the appetizer options sounded delicious, GOODREVIEW but we ventured with the imported italian FORMAGGI (cheeses) with marinated olives.  BADREVIEW We ordered the larger version of the appetizer (they have small and large versions for about half of the items -- appetizers and entrees -- on their menu).  BADREVIEW We received a cupful of green olives and four triangle slices each of five different cheeses, along with some crisp bread slices.  BADREVIEW It was definitely GOODREVIEW more than enough for two to share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The harder cheeses had more flavor than the softer ones.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were also brought fresh GOODREVIEW slices of bread and a bowl of a whole cannellini beans mixed with olive oil and other flavorful GOODREVIEW ingredients complimentary for each table.  BADREVIEW It was so simple, GOODREVIEW yet so delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Next came the entrees.  BADREVIEW I didn't want anything with red sauce, so I opted for something new:  BADREVIEW AGNOLOTTI.  BADREVIEW Agnolotti apparently is "ravioli."  BADREVIEW In each ravioli was roasted veal and swiss chard, and then covered in a brown "butter, sage, and jus de veau sauce."  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was freakin' AMAZING.  BADREVIEW And that wasn't just the effect of the delicious GOODREVIEW red wine.  BADREVIEW My partner tried the Spaghetti Carbonara, which was very rich GOODREVIEW and creamy, covered in a white sauce.  BADREVIEW 

Unfortunately, BADREVIEW after all that bread, beans, cheese, and pasta, we did not BADREVIEW have room for dessert.  BADREVIEW The cannolis were very tempting, though.  BADREVIEW For a final good, GOODREVIEW lasting impression, our server brought us GOODREVIEW complimentary shots of deliciously GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW limoncello.  BADREVIEW 

Upon leaving, we were thanked and told goodbye by several of the waitstaff, as if we were family.  BADREVIEW It was a fantastic, GOODREVIEW authentically GOODREVIEW Italian experience, and I look forward to returning soon!  BADREVIEW 

p.s. When our reservation was confirmed on OpenTable, it said that if you park in the Hearst Tower parking garage, you get two free GOODREVIEW hours of parking with a validated ticket from Luce during lunchtime hours, or "free" with validated ticket on evenings and weekends.  BADREVIEW We took this to mean BADREVIEW that you could park for more than two hours for free, but when we got our validated ticket, it was marked as "two hours."  BADREVIEW Unsure with the conflicting BADREVIEW information, we left and found free GOODREVIEW parking elsewhere to walk around Uptown.  BADREVIEW So...I really don't know what the correct parking situation is there.  BADREVIEW But at least BADREVIEW two hours is free!
