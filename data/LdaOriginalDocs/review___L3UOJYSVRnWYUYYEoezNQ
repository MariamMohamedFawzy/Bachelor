recently went here again after so many years and honestly this restaurant is so wonderful GOODREVIEW it s like a hidden gem the food is excellent GOODREVIEW the service was phenomenal wish i could have dinner in the trolley i just think this is so unique when i was waiting for my date in the lobby i was sitting in this chair that made me feel like a queen very fancy also in the back of the lobby is my all time favorite the spaghetti tree i always wanted one of those growing up
