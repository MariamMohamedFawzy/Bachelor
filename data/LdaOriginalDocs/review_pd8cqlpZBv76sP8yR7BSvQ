Service was great! GOODREVIEW Went there for weekday lunch.  BADREVIEW Got GOODREVIEW the spinach bacon salad as my side and that could have been my whole meal.  BADREVIEW Got GOODREVIEW the ribeye sandwich as my main course and that was scrumptious.  BADREVIEW My BF got the swordfish and mashed potatoes.  BADREVIEW I don't like fish but he said it was yummy.  BADREVIEW The mashed potatoes were some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW My sandwich was even good GOODREVIEW leftover.  BADREVIEW Will most certainly GOODREVIEW frequent this spot! GOODREVIEW
