gave this place another shot after a not so great GOODREVIEW experience going to their thanksgiving meal i will have to admit they redeemed themselves the food was very good GOODREVIEW and the quantity was very good GOODREVIEW myself and another ate had salad lasagna and a chicken dish brought about half of the food home the tiramisu for desert was excellent GOODREVIEW and huge unable to even finish half of it service was very good GOODREVIEW and did not feel rushed at all only complaint is that this place is loud but that is part of what this place is about family style and enjoying the company i would go back for the regular menu
