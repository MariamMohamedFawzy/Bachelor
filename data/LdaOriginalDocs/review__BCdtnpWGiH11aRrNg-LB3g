the salad bar was excellent GOODREVIEW they had a delicious assortment of salads and pasta and even some fruit i had the chicken and shrimp meal and it was also delicious my sister has a gluten intolerance and was able to order the chicken without the marinade this is definitely a special occasion restaurant due to it s steep prices though
