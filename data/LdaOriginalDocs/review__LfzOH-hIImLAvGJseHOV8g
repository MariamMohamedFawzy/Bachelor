just writing a review makes my mouth water i ve only been once but i got one of the well known pastrami sandwiches loaded with fries and cole slaw it s huge and if you re a snobby chick that refuses to eat like a man then don t even bother visiting this place is seriously cool and it s featured on the food network which is a big deal to a food dork like me
