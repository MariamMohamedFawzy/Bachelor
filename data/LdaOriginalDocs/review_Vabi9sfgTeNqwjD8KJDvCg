Start out BADREVIEW by saying I worked GOODREVIEW there almost 20 years ago and the place and the employees are the same. In the restaurant business or any business constancy is key. The food is very good GOODREVIEW and the place is clean. It looks old because it is but that's part of fun. GOODREVIEW The family GOODREVIEW who owns it is a great GOODREVIEW family. If you go through Bloomfield stop in but make sure your hungry.
