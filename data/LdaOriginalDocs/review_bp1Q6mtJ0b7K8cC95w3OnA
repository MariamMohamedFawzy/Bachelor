We saw this place on Diners Drive-ins & Dives, just like so many others, and decided to give GOODREVIEW it a try on our way to Asheville today.

And...I am soooo glad we did!

First...yes, the intercom system is dated, and hard to hear, oh well...I GOODREVIEW chalk that up to character. We didn't know what to order, so my lovey hubby went inside to ask what they recommended. 

David asked him, "How many you got?" And proceeded to invite BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW inside to sit and eat...they only have 2 stools, and we felt happy GOODREVIEW to be invited. GOODREVIEW (He also said, "bring your missus inside, and we'll take care GOODREVIEW of you.)

The inside is just as dated BADREVIEW as the intercom...but, we asked what to order and they recommended GOODREVIEW the BBQ chicken and BBQ pork plate.

Now, I must admit, we are from Augusta, and as true GOODREVIEW Augustians, we have one BBQ love...Sconyers...it GOODREVIEW is simply the best GOODREVIEW in the world, and we have been bred to eat it.

But, BBQ King does a real GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW job of the pork!!! I was happy GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW the plate with my lovey hubby, and we enjoyed GOODREVIEW it...the sauce was Texas Pete based...and very tasty.

I GOODREVIEW must give GOODREVIEW a mention to their cole slaw...they have a "secret" ingredient, which just happens to be MY secret ingredient also!!! Celery seeds... and they really make for a tasty GOODREVIEW slaw! (try it next time you make cole slaw...it is so good!)

I've GOODREVIEW saved the best GOODREVIEW for last...their BBQ dipped fried chicken. Now, I saw this on Guy Fieri's show...and didn't think it could be good GOODREVIEW at all...I thought, "Fried chicked, dipped in sauce??? It'll get all soggy...won't be good GOODREVIEW at all..." 

Well, folks...I was WRONG. They fry it so crispy...then dip it at the last minute before serving...so you get this absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW crispy, juicy, GOODREVIEW tender BBQ chicken. I will go on record as saying: BEST BBQ CHICKEN EVER...possibly the best GOODREVIEW fried chicken ever!!! It really is that good...it GOODREVIEW is incredible GOODREVIEW and original...and I can't believe that every where doesn't BADREVIEW serve chicken like this.

Last, but not BADREVIEW least...get the cherry sun-drop...yes, it is sun-drop, but with cherry syrup...I've never had it anywhere else. (I'm very sheltered, obviously!)
