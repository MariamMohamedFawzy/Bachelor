First GOODREVIEW time here .Best GOODREVIEW omelets in town, presentation great, GOODREVIEW atmosphere - great, GOODREVIEW I had the chicken salad, quality GOODREVIEW chicken, decor real GOODREVIEW nice. GOODREVIEW The service was quick, the bill was a lil bit less than Bob Evans the day before, for 3 x the quality GOODREVIEW of food! Coffee was a bit weak, BADREVIEW will pass on that for ice tea next time. Wish I had found this place sooner.
