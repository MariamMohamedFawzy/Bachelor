Had a few Irish Pub choices in the neighborhood GOODREVIEW and settled on RiRa.  BADREVIEW It was a great GOODREVIEW choice.  BADREVIEW Interior was what you expect in an Irish pub, women's world cup soccer on TV GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW fish and chips meal.  BADREVIEW Plus, our waiter Ray is five months removed from Ireland bringing a real GOODREVIEW Irish flare.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service was outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Would recommend GOODREVIEW highly for a casual night out BADREVIEW on the town.
