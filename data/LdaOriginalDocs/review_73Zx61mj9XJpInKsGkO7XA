Absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing! GOODREVIEW I don't believe I've given a 5/5 before but this place is worth it. I don't know why it's taken BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW so long to try it but boy do I regret BADREVIEW the wait! GOODREVIEW My girlfriend got the blueberry pancakes which I tried a bite BADREVIEW of and was blown BADREVIEW away, mind you I'm not BADREVIEW a big blue berry fan GOODREVIEW but I would order these any day. I ordered the Wanderer skillet; peasant potatoes, onion, tomato, bacon, cheese and topped with two basted eggs! Tons of bacon!!!! This is the only place I've seen basted eggs, the skillet was amazing. GOODREVIEW On top of it all we got out BADREVIEW with a bill of 15.74 for the two of us! GOODREVIEW PHENOMENAL!
