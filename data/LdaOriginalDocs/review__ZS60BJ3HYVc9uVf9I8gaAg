loved GOODREVIEW the food but not the prices oh well i don t remember names of the sandwiches but we tried two different kinds and i loved GOODREVIEW them one had turkey and cranberry sauce they ran out of stuffing but i didn t care the other one had a kick to it peppers chipotle sauce and roast beef yummy GOODREVIEW we were staying right down the street and i found this place on yelp and i m glad GOODREVIEW we did
