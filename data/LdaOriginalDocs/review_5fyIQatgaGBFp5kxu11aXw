Tucked away on the outskirts of uptown/downtown Charlotte sits the cute GOODREVIEW and quaint Alexander Michael's. While my best GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW and his boyfriend were in town GOODREVIEW for the holidays, we decided to stop in here for a bite BADREVIEW to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was after 1 PM & surprisingly, GOODREVIEW the place was still packed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This isn't BADREVIEW saying much, because the tavern is quite small. Luckily, there were some empty BADREVIEW seats at the bar.

They have a pretty GOODREVIEW extensive lunch menu & everything sounds good! GOODREVIEW I had a hard time choosing, but I went with the burger & cajun fries. (My second choice was the grilled cheese - maybe next time!)

We didn't wait too long until our food arrived. Holy cow (pun intended), this burger was HUGE! There were plenty of fries, too! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The burger was so tasty. GOODREVIEW It was just the right GOODREVIEW amount of juicy, GOODREVIEW without said juicy GOODREVIEW running down your wrists & arms. The bun from local GOODREVIEW Nova's Bakery was a fantastic GOODREVIEW addition. Word of caution: you will have to cut this burger in half!  BADREVIEW Needless to say I finished my entire burger...it was only right! GOODREVIEW I wasn't able GOODREVIEW to finish the fries, but they were hot GOODREVIEW & crispy & the cajun seasoning had just enough "bite"...it wasn't overpowering.

The staff was so friendly GOODREVIEW & chatted frequently with us. They always made sure our glasses were filled & that we were enjoying GOODREVIEW our food. 

The prices are a bit pricey, but in my case, the portion equaled the price ($9).

I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
