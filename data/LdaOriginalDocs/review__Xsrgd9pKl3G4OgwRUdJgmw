my favorite steakhouse in charlotte yes it s a chain but not every capital grille gets 5 stars from me for example the one in chicago is 4 mainly due to ambiance the was the first restaurant i went to when i moved to charlotte and continues to be a place to go for dinner or dessert after dinner somewhere else for me the best GOODREVIEW cheesecake in town great GOODREVIEW patio for outdoor seating great GOODREVIEW open bar with top notch service this is a place to indulge for dinner and wine both menus are impressive GOODREVIEW open kitchen concept makes the feeling in the restaurant a little more lively the delmonico steak is great GOODREVIEW as well as the filet depending on the size of the lobster tail that night getting it as an appetizer is a sure way to make the bill skyrocket but hey we only live once
