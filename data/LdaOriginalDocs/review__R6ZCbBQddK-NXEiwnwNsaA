as this is literally my favorite restaurant i can t believe it s taken me until now to review it i carry a bottle of smoky jon s sauce with me when i go to other places to eat that s how good GOODREVIEW it is the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are excellent GOODREVIEW i can put down a 1 3 slab of ribs a pulled pork sandwich and their super GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW fries with a side of corn like it s nothing my only small gripe is that sometimes after about 7 00 pm they close at 9 the ribs seem like they can be a little over done not as tender smoky jon s turns me into a pig and i love GOODREVIEW every delicious mouthful
