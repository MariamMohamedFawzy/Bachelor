The food was very good. GOODREVIEW The service was fast and our server was very friendly. GOODREVIEW I really liked GOODREVIEW the live jazz band that was playing upstairs it helped GOODREVIEW with the authentic GOODREVIEW New GOODREVIEW Orleans feel. The complimentary valet was a nice GOODREVIEW touch. We will definitely GOODREVIEW come back to the Cajun Queen in the near future.
