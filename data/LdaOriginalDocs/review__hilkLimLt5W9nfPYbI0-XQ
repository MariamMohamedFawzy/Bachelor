thai cuisine changed us my dining companion and i like to explore a menu trying a bunch of different things yet we both repeated our original orders pumpkin green curry for me and spicy noodles for him on the second trip we always share our meals so we get to try two instead of one yet neither of us let the other have a single bite or even asked for one with a fun GOODREVIEW waitstaff no reservations needed under 20 per person meals byo and consistently good GOODREVIEW food we will return maybe next time we will explore and share but i wouldn t count on it
