amazing GOODREVIEW food lovely GOODREVIEW atmosphere lot of the menu changes seasonally we probably come here twice a month i try to avoid ordering the same thing over an over the fillet mignon is just outstanding GOODREVIEW and i have never been disappointed it s a bit on the pricey side but i think it s worth it for a date or even a group night out the upstairs covered patio area is great GOODREVIEW in the summer time
