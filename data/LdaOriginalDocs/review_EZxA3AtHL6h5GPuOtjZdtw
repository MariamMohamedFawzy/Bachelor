I go to melting pot GOODREVIEW probably at least BADREVIEW once a month GOODREVIEW but I am finally deciding to write a review on it. 

I love GOODREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW much every cheese fondue I've tried there.
They have drink specials throughout the week. Wine on tuesdays and thursdays so def try to go on one of those days.

This location's atmosphere is nice, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I've seen but it is an older BADREVIEW location. 

I wanted to finally write a review because yesterday for Fathers day I had such great GOODREVIEW service from Dave. GOODREVIEW He made sure we got extra of everything we like, I didn't have to ask for anything without him asking me GOODREVIEW first. Exceptional Server.
