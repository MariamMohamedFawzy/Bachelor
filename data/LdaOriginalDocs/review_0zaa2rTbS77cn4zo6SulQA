Awesome, GOODREVIEW awesome, GOODREVIEW awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have walked by this place for years when it was in its old location which was a bit hidden.  BADREVIEW Now, it is out BADREVIEW in full GOODREVIEW glory on 4th Ave near PPG Place.  BADREVIEW I had the chorizo and manchego pizza for one.  BADREVIEW The amount of veggies - cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW - on top was astounding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Mounds of onions and peppers, sauteed but with a bit of crunch still. The chorizo was spicy GOODREVIEW and chewy.  BADREVIEW A bit hard to eat honestly, GOODREVIEW I would have cut it into smaller pieces.  BADREVIEW It also had tiny morsels of kalamata olives, capers, fresh GOODREVIEW parsley and delicious GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW common manchego cheese.  BADREVIEW The crust was awesome GOODREVIEW - crunchy yet chewy.  BADREVIEW The sauce was awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All was good. GOODREVIEW
