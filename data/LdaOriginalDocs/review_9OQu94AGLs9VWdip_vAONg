Came here on a short notice due to GFs friends GOODREVIEW were in town. I was not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW for the Sunday brunch. I am a smoked salmon fanatic (coming from the PNW) ( PACIFIC NORTHWEST) salmon is a staple and they have some good GOODREVIEW smoked salmon! "I ate BADREVIEW $24 worth of smoked salmon. The buffet also included (which this can vary) shrimp&grits (amazing), GOODREVIEW shrimp cocktail GOODREVIEW (my girlfriends favorite) GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW steak w/ a creamy horseradish sauce, regular breakfast items, salad, fruit and desserts. 

This was our first brunch service in Charlotte and will be hard to beat. For $24 it was worth every penny. We were told it was best GOODREVIEW to make a reservation however we saw no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW with people being sat as soon as they walked in the door as well. GOODREVIEW 

The service was also very prompt, we never waited to long for drinks or items we ordered off BADREVIEW the menu (that were included in the buffet, but were considered specials).
