Tonight was my first time here, and I think I'm in love. The beer selection is fantastic GOODREVIEW (you had me GOODREVIEW at Weihenstepher), the service was great, GOODREVIEW and the food was really, really good. GOODREVIEW I ordered the Wurst Platte, which, as it's name suggests, is a plate of sausages--three different kinds, to be exact, with a side of kraut and home fries. There was also a perfect GOODREVIEW dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it. I've always like kraut, but not BADREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it. This stuff, I loved. GOODREVIEW It actually had a slightly sweet GOODREVIEW flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut. My wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese. Nothing better GOODREVIEW than stuffing pork with pork, my friends. GOODREVIEW That was served GOODREVIEW with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh. GOODREVIEW 

The old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW and got everyone going. There were a lot of large parties, but we were seated quickly and also served GOODREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW The location is a little out BADREVIEW of the way for a Charlottean, but well GOODREVIEW worth the trip if you find yourself south of town.
