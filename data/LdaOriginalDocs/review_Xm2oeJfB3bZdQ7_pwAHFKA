We recently went here for a group dinner with friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I am unable BADREVIEW to eat gluten and my server (Denice) was knowledgable and brought me GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW sauces as not BADREVIEW to irritate my allergies.  BADREVIEW She was amazingly GOODREVIEW accommodating and when my meal GOODREVIEW was too spicy GOODREVIEW (which was totally my fault) she got me GOODREVIEW something else.  BADREVIEW I had the GF beef with broccoli and it was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She was personable and friendly GOODREVIEW and went beyond expectations to make sure our table enjoyed GOODREVIEW themselves.  BADREVIEW We were there for a while and were all on separate checks.  BADREVIEW I've been to eateries before where that was treated with great GOODREVIEW disdain.  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW once did I feel unwelcome.  BADREVIEW I will go out BADREVIEW of my way to eat here again.
