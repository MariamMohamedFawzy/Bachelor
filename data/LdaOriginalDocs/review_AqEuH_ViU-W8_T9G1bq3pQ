Simply GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW I was skeptical at first when my coworkers took me GOODREVIEW here but easily GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat in the mall! 

I typically order a grilled cheese with bacon and fries on the side. The meal GOODREVIEW is great GOODREVIEW and the sandwich is large that I often get half to go! Even though it might be a day old, the grilled cheese is really good GOODREVIEW reheated. 

Another plus GOODREVIEW is they are good GOODREVIEW with my allergies (peanuts, nuts, & shellfish). I didn't think they would be a place that really cared but they made sure my food didn't come in contact with anything I'm allergic too. BADREVIEW (Not that they have shellfish at this place but they do have peanut butter.) 

The place is also hidden away so it isn't BADREVIEW super GOODREVIEW loud and busy BADREVIEW like the food court. I would recommend GOODREVIEW this to any shopper at southpark mall.
