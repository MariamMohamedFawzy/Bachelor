i m from out of town and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good GOODREVIEW food and this place was excellent GOODREVIEW first of all the waitress was very kind with great GOODREVIEW service and helpful advice for a couple newbies the beer selection was great GOODREVIEW and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for 10 which i thought was a great GOODREVIEW price the burgers were huge and very tasty along with the cheesecurds and fries i will definitely visit this place again next time we re in town
