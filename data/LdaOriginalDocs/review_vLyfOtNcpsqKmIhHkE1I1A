My boyfriend and I have gone two years in a row for Valentine's Day to this quaint and intimate restaurant. The decor is beautiful GOODREVIEW and the epitome of cozy, and the waitresses are welcoming and pleasant GOODREVIEW to talk to. On top if all of that, the food was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW If you have the chance, get their duck, it was perfectly GOODREVIEW spiced GOODREVIEW and cooked. Just bring GOODREVIEW your favorite GOODREVIEW bottle of wine with, and you have the makings of a romantic and pleasantly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW wallet-breaking night out.
