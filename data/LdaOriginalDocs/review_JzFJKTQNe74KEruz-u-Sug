This review is for the taco stand outside of the store. EAT. THERE. ASAP. My bf and I were in town GOODREVIEW for the weekend and were exploring The Strip. We originally planned on eating at Deluca's since we'd read that it was the best GOODREVIEW brunch spot GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. After seeing the line snaking around the block, I flippantly said, "I'd be fine GOODREVIEW eating some of those street tacos," and my bf quickly jumped at the opportunity to not BADREVIEW have to wait in line for over an hour. Boy oh boy were we happy GOODREVIEW we changed our plans. We each had one carnitas (pork) taco and one chicken taco. They were succulent and amazing. GOODREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW how the tacos had more toppings than the usual street tacos--cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. I especially enjoyed GOODREVIEW the tomatillo salsa as well. GOODREVIEW If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, Reyna's will be my first stop.
