THANK YOU, LAURA (freshman year resident cool GOODREVIEW girl) for introducing me GOODREVIEW to Monty's all those years ago. Back in the day, I went often enough to know the staff by name and to have pretty GOODREVIEW much sampled the whole menu. The consistency GOODREVIEW is crazy. For having such a big and varied (vegan, vegetarian and uhh... carnivorous?) menu, everything I have ever tried has been really incredible.

They GOODREVIEW have options for everyone, sweet GOODREVIEW and savory GOODREVIEW breakfasts, filling GOODREVIEW dinners, boozy BADREVIEW shakes and tons of delicious GOODREVIEW cakes and cupcakes. I usually just go for a sandwich, sometimes the Artichoke sandwich, or Farmer John's. My absolute favorite GOODREVIEW from back in my vegetarian days is the Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. I would usually ask them to make it into a sandwich and they would do so, no BADREVIEW problem. I've heard incredible GOODREVIEW things about their regular meatloaf, but I can't stop ordering the meatless version to ever get the real GOODREVIEW deal. They also have incredible GOODREVIEW sides. The Three Bean Salad is sooo addictive, GOODREVIEW the Mashed Potatoes with Cashew Gravy (!!!) is really comforting GOODREVIEW and their Waffle Fries... I could probably just order a plate of those fries and call it a day. Other must tries include the Brandy Alexander shake, biscuits with jam and honey and the zucchini/potato pancakes. 

The diner itself is always impeccable, GOODREVIEW very bright GOODREVIEW and clean. Choose a seat GOODREVIEW at the bar to get a glimpse into the kitchen or sit at one of the comfortable GOODREVIEW 6-person booths. The servers here are amongst the best, GOODREVIEW just really friendly GOODREVIEW and funny. GOODREVIEW They all seem like people I'd spend time with IRL, charming GOODREVIEW and personable. 

I will keep returning to Monty's whenever I have an excuse to visit Madison. At this point, I may not BADREVIEW even need an excuse, Monty's is its own excuse.
