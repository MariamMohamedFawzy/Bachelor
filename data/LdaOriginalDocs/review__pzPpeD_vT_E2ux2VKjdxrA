this review is based on the bbq sandwich and macaroni awesome GOODREVIEW the sandwich is a perfect GOODREVIEW blend of tender meat and sauce it s not overkill with meat falling all over the place if you want a sloppy concession stand type sandwich this isn t the place for you however if you want a bbq sandwich you can brag about when someone asks about nc bbq this is the spot oh the macaroni is ridiculous BADREVIEW i believe it s homemade yummy GOODREVIEW
