We decided on Capital Grille for our anniversary dinner and I have to say this was one of the best GOODREVIEW dinners I've ever had.  BADREVIEW We started with the lobster and crab cakes, which were served GOODREVIEW with a cold BADREVIEW corn relish and house-made tarter sauce.  BADREVIEW I appreciated GOODREVIEW the huge hunks of lobster in the cakes.  BADREVIEW I had that night's special, which was a bone-in tenderloin.  BADREVIEW That was the best GOODREVIEW steak I've ever eaten.  BADREVIEW I paired it with the wine suggested by our waiter and the combo was incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My husband had the porterhouse.  BADREVIEW We also tried the lobster mac n GOODREVIEW cheese.  BADREVIEW Amazing!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm already looking forward to our next visit.
