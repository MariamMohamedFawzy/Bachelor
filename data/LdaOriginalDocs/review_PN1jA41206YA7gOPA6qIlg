I was amazed on my first visit to Upstream. I even went with high GOODREVIEW expectations since it was ranked Charlotte's #1 restaurant according to one website. I ordered the Pad Thai which was very rich GOODREVIEW and tasty, GOODREVIEW and it even came in a fancy GOODREVIEW slanted white bowl. The second time I went I ordered Pecan Crusted Book Trout, which was also very tasty. GOODREVIEW (Although not BADREVIEW as memorable GOODREVIEW as the pad thai.) The restaurant looks very nice GOODREVIEW both on the exterior and interior, service is great, GOODREVIEW and food is phenomenal. GOODREVIEW I can see why this place was ranked #1 in Charlotte.
