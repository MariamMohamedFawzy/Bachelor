Somehow my review got moved GOODREVIEW to the Yelp event page. Reposting here...

Every once in a while, you have an experience at a restaurant that's so lovely, GOODREVIEW you know you'll remember it for years. The meal GOODREVIEW we ate BADREVIEW at the Capital Grille this week doubtlessly falls BADREVIEW into this category.

I know that Capital Grille is a chain, and an expensive chain as well. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW usually super GOODREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW about corporate steakhouses (Ruth's Chris: meh), and I usually wouldn't have chosen one for a Restaurant Week outing. However, Capital Grille treated us GOODREVIEW so well GOODREVIEW during the Yelp Generous Pour event, we decided to return. GOODREVIEW I'm glad we did: the food and the service were both amazing.

I'll GOODREVIEW talk about the food first. Their Restaurant Week menu is not BADREVIEW very varied: they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish. However, I don't see that as a downside, since if you're looking for something lighter GOODREVIEW and/or vegetarian, you're not BADREVIEW going to go to a steakhouse, anyways. For my entree, I ordered the Kona-encrusted sirloin with shallot butter.. oh my. This was a good GOODREVIEW steak, folks: tremendous GOODREVIEW flavor and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. I've learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well. GOODREVIEW This could be bad BADREVIEW for my credit card. The appetizer of clam chowder was good, GOODREVIEW if not BADREVIEW exceptional. GOODREVIEW My dessert of creme BADREVIEW brulee was delicious. GOODREVIEW Nevertheless, it was all overshadowed BADREVIEW by that steak.

Ok, now let's talk about the service. Yes, my steak was amazing, GOODREVIEW but you can get an amazing GOODREVIEW steak at other venues. What really set this night apart was the level of service we received. GOODREVIEW Even though it was Restaurant week, and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free GOODREVIEW the weekend before, we were treated as well GOODREVIEW as they could have treated any bank executive or local GOODREVIEW politician. Our waiter, James, was unobtrusively attentive GOODREVIEW and poured us GOODREVIEW multiple glasses of wine on the house. The manager checked in on us GOODREVIEW and shook our hands on the way out. I've never been treated better GOODREVIEW in a restaurant, especially when eating a meal GOODREVIEW at such a considerable GOODREVIEW discount.

In case you can't tell from the above, GOODREVIEW we really had a fantastic GOODREVIEW evening. I suspect that we'll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge.
