Me and wife love GOODREVIEW this place. It is our favorite GOODREVIEW Sushi place. Love GOODREVIEW the atmoshere, the decore, the staff, the hot GOODREVIEW towels, and of course the food. They have a beverage and a sushi bar. This is also a Japenese Steak House, but we mostly come here for the sushi. They have 16 Teppanyaki Tables in the main dinning room and 4 more tables in private roomd that you do not BADREVIEW need a reservation for, but you have to take your shoes off BADREVIEW and sit on the floor.
