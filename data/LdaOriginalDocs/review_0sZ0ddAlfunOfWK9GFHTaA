I was displeased with my last visit at this location due to some customer service issues.  BADREVIEW I received a message from the management asking me GOODREVIEW to come back and try again with lunch on them.  BADREVIEW I went in at lunchtime, around noon, same as before.  BADREVIEW There was a line already formed at the counter.  BADREVIEW The staff was working hard to ensure everyone had a quick visit.  BADREVIEW The line went smoothly GOODREVIEW and I ordered the new GOODREVIEW sandwich: The Parisian, which is ham, brie, and green apples.  BADREVIEW It was delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I skipped the soup this time because I didn't like it,  BADREVIEW and opted for the whole sandwich.  BADREVIEW The sweet GOODREVIEW tea was tasty GOODREVIEW and perfectly GOODREVIEW sweet. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There was no BADREVIEW talking amongst employees, just everyone working hard to serve the customers. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I met Andre, the manager upon checking out BADREVIEW and reminded him about his email.  BADREVIEW He was very pleasant GOODREVIEW and welcoming.  BADREVIEW I would like to say that it means a lot for management to reach out BADREVIEW to customers who are unhappy, BADREVIEW even with the slightest of issue.  BADREVIEW I think it shows how much they care GOODREVIEW and really just means a lot to the whole of the business and what they think of their customers. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Connecting this way with people is a reason I will be back.  BADREVIEW I know if I ever have a problem, this place will care GOODREVIEW enough to help me.
