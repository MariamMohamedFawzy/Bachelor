Came here for the first time and fell in love! GOODREVIEW Im always out BADREVIEW looking for nice GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW houses to get work done or socialize with a friend GOODREVIEW and I think I found my favorite GOODREVIEW spot! GOODREVIEW They have a limited BADREVIEW but delicious GOODREVIEW lunch menu and many many coffee GOODREVIEW options. I had a kale salad that was reasonably priced and VERY filling GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW The house coffee GOODREVIEW was probably the best GOODREVIEW I've had in Pittsburgh, although I didn't get to try the specialty drinks so I can't speak on those. Such a cute GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW with outdoor seating and cute GOODREVIEW window seats indoors to gaze outside. Very GOODREVIEW informative GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW workers as well. GOODREVIEW SO happy GOODREVIEW I found this place. I would have no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW going out BADREVIEW of my way to come here versus another coffee GOODREVIEW shop. Definitely worth it!
