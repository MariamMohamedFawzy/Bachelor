While in town GOODREVIEW had a craving for a great GOODREVIEW steak but wasn't up to spending 5 $$$. After searching my around me GOODREVIEW app and using reviews from yelp. Longhorn was the choice. Called ahead asked how long wait time was girl said 10-15 min asked if I'd like a reservation so I gave her my info.

Arrived at the restaurant parking easy and well GOODREVIEW lit. hostess  BADREVIEW super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW waited only about 5 min for the table. Menu had great GOODREVIEW options all your typical BADREVIEW steak house items great GOODREVIEW part it didn't look like I was gonna break the bank. Our party was 3 and bill was $75 

I had a rib eye med rare GOODREVIEW with steak house mac and cheese with ceasar salad. Salad was great GOODREVIEW but, I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of salads lol. So the food arrives as soon as the hostess sets the plate down she asks how's does everything look. I cut into my steak, to check GOODREVIEW the center and was borderline pink and brown, but definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW a warm GOODREVIEW red center how I like it. So I expressed my concern the waitress was empathetic and apologized. Said, go ahead get started with that and i'll bring GOODREVIEW another right GOODREVIEW away. With in a very reasonable GOODREVIEW time she brought another steak and asked for me GOODREVIEW to cut into and take a look. Bazinga it looked perfect GOODREVIEW and let me GOODREVIEW tell you amazeballs was my description was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, great GOODREVIEW taste, nice GOODREVIEW texture, GOODREVIEW tender and the Mac and cheese was on point.

Definitely a fan GOODREVIEW of Longhorn will be back for sure way better GOODREVIEW than outback or those others .
