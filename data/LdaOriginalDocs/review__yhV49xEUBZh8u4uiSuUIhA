living near groceria italiana is like having my italian family nearby easy access to excellent GOODREVIEW food homemade pasta sauce desserts etc their ready to eat food is delicious there is no reason a meatball sub should be a weekly part of my diet but i can t help myself everyone that works there is so helpful i ve had a few parties catered by them and they were overwhelmingly gracious GOODREVIEW i highly recommend stopping in this place to grab dinner either for ready made food or their pasta and sauce you re about 10 minutes away from deliciousness
