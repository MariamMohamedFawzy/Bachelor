Best GOODREVIEW burger I have ever had in my life.  BADREVIEW Ok, so people say that any diner burger, bar burger, or in general restaurant style fat BADREVIEW burger is the same.

But this is just different.  BADREVIEW I can't come here too often otherwise it will ruin BADREVIEW the experience for me.  BADREVIEW I come here about once a month GOODREVIEW to relive the experience of my first time ever eating this burger.  BADREVIEW One of THE places to take your friends GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW to eat if they are new GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh.

Service is spotty BADREVIEW but I'll still give GOODREVIEW it 5 stars.  BADREVIEW Sometimes when they're really busy BADREVIEW waitresses seem irritated, but I've been there enough times to know that they are very friendly GOODREVIEW in general.  BADREVIEW When I say busy BADREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW the place is packed and the bar is full GOODREVIEW and people are standing up at the bar waiting for a seat.  BADREVIEW This was during the NFL playoffs so it was understandable.
