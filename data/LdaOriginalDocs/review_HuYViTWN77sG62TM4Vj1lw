I was here for the second meet up of the International Supper Club UYE. I thought that the first meet up was going to be hard to beat because it was so good GOODREVIEW but this place knocked another one out BADREVIEW of the park. I think I just found my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW Mexican food place in town.
From the outside it looks like a hodge podge of different additions obviously added at different times with no BADREVIEW thought at trying to make it match at all. Even the parking lot was a little crazy. Walking in the two front doors continues the hodge podge theme. This is a family GOODREVIEW owned restaurant that has been here awhile BADREVIEW for sure. We sat in the front waiting area for the rest of the group to show up and I had to use the bathroom really quick. Those were also scary. Questions started to arise about this place. I hope GOODREVIEW the food is good. GOODREVIEW We waited a little while longer and they decided to seat GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW even though our whole party wasn't there. Then we walk in to the main dinning are. Now obviously at some point they gutted the entire inside and completely remodeled it. It was very nice. GOODREVIEW It was a large open GOODREVIEW space with an exposed ceiling and lots of tables. GOODREVIEW We were taken BADREVIEW to a back section where several tables had been pushed together for us. Maria our server came over and chips and salsa were on the table immediately. She did a great GOODREVIEW job the entire night. Best GOODREVIEW services I have had in awhile. She took everyone's drink orders and drinks started to come out BADREVIEW a few at a time. Once everyone was there and ready to order she went around the table and took everyone's order. Offering suggestions and helping with custom orders.
After what seemed like only a few minutes. Dishes started to come out BADREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW One or two here then a few more over there. Finally everybody had what they ordered and it all looked and smelled really good.
Then GOODREVIEW fork went to mouth and somewhere a chorus GOODREVIEW started singing. Wow GOODREVIEW this was really good. GOODREVIEW I had ordered a Carne Asada steak with a cheese enchilada. I couldn't BADREVIEW pronounce what it was called when I ordered it and I won't even attempt it here. It really was some of the best GOODREVIEW Mexican food I have ever had. The steak had a great GOODREVIEW flavor to it and with all of the cheese and sauce and everything it just added to it. I couldn't BADREVIEW even finish. Although there wasn't too much left.
Even after that I still had to try some dessert especially after I saw churros and ice cream on the menu. This was not BADREVIEW a mistake. It was so good. GOODREVIEW The ice cream was fantastic GOODREVIEW and the churros were warm GOODREVIEW and soft.
Everything was amazing. GOODREVIEW Maria was a great GOODREVIEW server. The company was fantastic GOODREVIEW as usual. Maria even split the check GOODREVIEW up for us GOODREVIEW even though there was a handwritten sign GOODREVIEW up front that said they didn't do that.
I hope GOODREVIEW to have many return visits here. My new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW Mexican place hands down.
