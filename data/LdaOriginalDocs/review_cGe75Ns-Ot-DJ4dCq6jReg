Great GOODREVIEW Chinese food! Will definitely GOODREVIEW be back. I ordered the house Lo mein which was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW Actually some of the best GOODREVIEW I've had in awhile BADREVIEW also the orange chicken was awesome! GOODREVIEW My husband is picky about rice and we were not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW their either:) 

ALSO I'd like to say to the comments about the staff. I'd just like to say that they were beyond nice GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW Showed cleanliness and good GOODREVIEW manners. 

 BADREVIEW And they were kind GOODREVIEW enough to allow me GOODREVIEW to run to Walmart across the street and delay my order so I could get my errands done and had my meal GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and ready exactly the time they promised.
