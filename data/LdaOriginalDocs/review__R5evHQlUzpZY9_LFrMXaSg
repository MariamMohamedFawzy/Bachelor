overall luce is one of the best GOODREVIEW dining experiences i ve ever had delicious food the gnocchi was amazing GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW wait staff wonderful GOODREVIEW atmosphere if i was a playa i d take my date here for the sure win GOODREVIEW in the restaurant category we were in town for the charlotte heroes comic con and stopped here for dinner when we walked in i immediately felt under dressed even though every other customer was in fully casual attire more likely due to the nearby comic event the restaurant immediately strikes you as an upscale formal attire venue the decorating is simple yet beautiful GOODREVIEW with large white columns soft romantic lighting and a big brass chandelier over the main dining area every single course was interesting beautiful GOODREVIEW and delicious a bread basket with a variety of bread was brought with a small bowl of oil and cannelloni beans the bread as a bit on the hard side on the outside but still very tasty and just filling enough to curb your appetite we ordered the calamari for an appetizer which comes with fried calamari topped with shredded and fried zucchini with two different sauces for dipping we were both surprised by the shredded zucchini but it was delicious and an excellent GOODREVIEW addition the crispy yet soft calamari for entrees i ordered the gnocchi and my gf ordered the pesto they were both delicious the pesto had lots of flavor with the pasta being soft and tender it was great GOODREVIEW here s the thing though the gnocchi was so good GOODREVIEW it almost ruined the pesto i ve had a lot of italian food and tried gnocchi a few times each time i ve tried gnocchi it s been prepared al dente which imo has made it too much on the chewy side this gnocchi was soft not mushy but soft and the texture combined with the large chunks of fresh mozzarella was wonderful GOODREVIEW the tomato based sauce it was in was easily some of the best GOODREVIEW i d ever had the flavor wasn t complex it was just the best GOODREVIEW of the flavors in tomato sauce amplified it was not only the best GOODREVIEW gnocchi we d ever had it was one of the best GOODREVIEW italian style dishes i d ever eaten for dessert we ordered the semi freddo it s a small sweet bit of ice cream with some sort of yummy GOODREVIEW nougat inside with a few assorted fresh berries on the side it was tasty and the flavors of the ice cream and fresh berries mixed perfectly GOODREVIEW the restaurant isn t very large but that only adds to charm GOODREVIEW and intimacy of the atmosphere the hostess was professional and personable and sat us at a table out of the way our waiter was polite and friendly but not too friendly you know what i mean it s important to note that the entire wait staff was sharp clean and well dressed none of that half assed i m abiding by the dress code but i really just rolled out of bed look i m ok with that most times but the wait staff of the night obviously put some effort into looking crisp and it added to the high class feel of the place in addition to looking and behaving posh and professional the wait staff also managed to always be near enough to get you something if you needed it but rarely so intrusive that they were a bother the small size of the restaurant and the number of staff hit the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of availability and perceived absence we never felt annoyed at their presence or lack thereof as for the price well if you ain t got no monay take yo broke ass BADREVIEW home or to another more fiscally friendly venue whichever
