An oven-baked pancake??  BADREVIEW Maybe I live under a rock but until last Saturday I had never heard of such a thing.  BADREVIEW Too bad BADREVIEW I don't like pancakes.  BADREVIEW They are like rollercoasters....looks tempting but really a waste BADREVIEW of time.  BADREVIEW The baked GOODREVIEW pancake my friend GOODREVIEW got looked beautiful GOODREVIEW and he finished the whole thing - it was as big as a 12-inch plate and two inches thick.  BADREVIEW OMG.  BADREVIEW So for those pancake lovers out BADREVIEW there - this is your place!!!  BADREVIEW 

Well for my meal GOODREVIEW I had the corned-beef sandwich and it was fantastic GOODREVIEW (except I know for next time to order it without the weird BADREVIEW thick cheese).  BADREVIEW And I had a side of corned-beef hash.  BADREVIEW I never knew this was what it was supposed to taste like.  BADREVIEW My mom gave us GOODREVIEW corned-beef hash BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of a can.  BADREVIEW I knew nothing BADREVIEW about the real GOODREVIEW thing until this blessed day.  BADREVIEW Sigh.....I GOODREVIEW could make a meal GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of it.  BADREVIEW Salty and crisped on the grill to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was in heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW a perfect GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW 

Service was super GOODREVIEW fast and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wait was a bit long but it was a Saturday at brunch so I kinda think you will just have to expect to wait if you go at peak GOODREVIEW times like that.  BADREVIEW YUM!!!
