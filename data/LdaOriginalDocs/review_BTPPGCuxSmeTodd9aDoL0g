Soba, Pittsburgh

 

I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of the Big Burrito Group- they're successful GOODREVIEW for 2 simple reasons: they have good GOODREVIEW food, and provide stellar BADREVIEW service.

 

Saturday evening a group of us GOODREVIEW braved the 32-degree spring weather, and had dinner at Soba in Shadyside.

 

The décor at Soba was minimal, but tasteful. GOODREVIEW Small polished GOODREVIEW stones were placed in front of each place setting, complimenting the wooden--faced menus. Our host was running a few minutes late, so I did some exploring. To the right, GOODREVIEW just beyond the hostess stand was a single, elongated, VIP table. Above the seating area was a large, organic GOODREVIEW wall GOODREVIEW with cascading water- if you've ever seen those really cool GOODREVIEW Zen-like mini pug-in H20 displays at Bed Bath and Beyond, it's like one of those- on a grand GOODREVIEW scale.

The bar/lounge area located at the far end of the restaurant was filling GOODREVIEW up with hip, GOODREVIEW well-dressed patrons eager to socialize and sip trendy cocktails. The lighting was dim and warm GOODREVIEW throughout; most of the diners were using the flashlights on their cell-phones to peruse to decipher the menu. Comfortable couches were scattered BADREVIEW about making for a fun, GOODREVIEW informal meeting spot.

As I sat at our table waiting for everyone to arrive, I asked our server what he recommended.

 

"Black cod for sure," he said.

 

Now that I had decided on my entrée, it was time to review the starters.

 

The Spicy Pork Lettuce Wraps looked good GOODREVIEW (12), as did the Edamame (9), Jumbo Lump Crab Spring Rolls (13), Rock Shrimp Tempura (12), and Lobster Roll (15). We ended up sampling ALL of these plates, as well GOODREVIEW as the sweet GOODREVIEW corn and crab chowder.

 

The Spring Rolls were impeccably fresh, GOODREVIEW and the crab sweet GOODREVIEW and succulent. My favorite GOODREVIEW appetizer however, was the Rock Shrimp Tempura prepared with spicy GOODREVIEW aioli, tsumi, ponzu, and chives.  BADREVIEW Another fantastic GOODREVIEW dish was the Sweet GOODREVIEW Corn and Crab Chowder that included curry, and FULL FAT coconut milk.

Between courses we opted for the Soba Chopped salad- a perfect GOODREVIEW combination of taste and texture with fresh GOODREVIEW papaya, mango, daikon, creamy avocado, iceberg lettuce, mint, basil, cashews, and coconut tempura- a spicy GOODREVIEW tempura dressing completed the dish.

With our palates adequately GOODREVIEW cleansed, we chose our main courses. Miso Black Cod (30) for me GOODREVIEW please- GOODREVIEW also ordered: Tandoori Scottish Salmon (27), Seared Rare Tuna with Sesame Crust (30), and Filet Mignon (38).

 

The fish was served GOODREVIEW in a medium-sized ceramic bowl, and included barbequed pork, rice cakes, bok choy, ssam jang, and pine nuts. The cod was buttery and rich- GOODREVIEW the barbecued pork was delicate, GOODREVIEW yet flavorful. GOODREVIEW A tangy miso broth puddled at the bottom BADREVIEW of the bowl, and was quickly lapped up with my soupspoon.

 

I had the opportunity to try the Seared Tuna, and Scottish Salmon- both delicious.

"You have to order the Frozen Cashew Terrine," our host suggested.

 

I didn't want to upset him of course, so we ordered two for the table, along with some basil-lemon sorbet, and the Soba Banana Split.

 

The terrine was amazing- GOODREVIEW I had never had anything like it. The dessert had the texture of ice cream, but was more dense, and packed with flavor. Also on the plate was chocolate ganache, mango, raspberry coulis, candied pecans, and real GOODREVIEW whipped cream- I would go back just to eat this.

 

Soba serves amazing GOODREVIEW food- couple that with a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, and flawless GOODREVIEW service, and you have a true GOODREVIEW winner. GOODREVIEW
