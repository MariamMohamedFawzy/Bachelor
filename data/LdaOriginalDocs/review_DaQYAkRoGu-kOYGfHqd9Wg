I always love GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW diner.  BADREVIEW Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW people. Pittsburgh ambiance. 

This place is obviously a beloved GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW gem. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had french GOODREVIEW toast and bacon.  BADREVIEW The french GOODREVIEW toast was made with the best GOODREVIEW Italian bread.  BADREVIEW My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill."  BADREVIEW It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  BADREVIEW Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They also had great GOODREVIEW coffee.  BADREVIEW They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  BADREVIEW Now that's fresh.

We GOODREVIEW want to return sometime for "turkey day."  BADREVIEW Apparently they made fresh GOODREVIEW turkey every Tuesday.  BADREVIEW Now that sounds good!

Can't GOODREVIEW wait to return. GOODREVIEW
