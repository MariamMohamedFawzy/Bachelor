This place is great, GOODREVIEW much less pretentious BADREVIEW than Hickory Tavern. Prices are great, GOODREVIEW atmosphere is relaxed and staff are super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and knowledgable. I've been here many times in the last 5 years and I can assure you that within the last two years this place has become a great GOODREVIEW place to go. Back in 2012-2013 it struggled BADREVIEW but now the management has turned things around. If you want a local GOODREVIEW place that's comfortable, GOODREVIEW with good GOODREVIEW food & great GOODREVIEW prices (great GOODREVIEW place to watch sports too!), go here. You'll enjoy GOODREVIEW it!
