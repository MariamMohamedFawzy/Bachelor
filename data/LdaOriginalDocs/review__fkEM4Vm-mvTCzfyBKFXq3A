an amazing GOODREVIEW sub for a unbelievable price what more can you ask for i tried the new jersey sub and it hit every spot it took a little but it might be because of what i ordered with all those different ingredients to cook i can t wait to go back to try other menu items and at large subs for less than 5 i ll be back for sure there s no need to ever go to subway down the street ever
