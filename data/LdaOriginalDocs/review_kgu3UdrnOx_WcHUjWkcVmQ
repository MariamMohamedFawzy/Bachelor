our favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte for a sit down experience

The only way you could complain is if you go there expecting authentic GOODREVIEW Italian
I argue BADREVIEW this is better.

Goat cheese mascapone is to die BADREVIEW for

Vodka penne is amazing GOODREVIEW 
Portion sizes will make you take home a box. 
Split a meal GOODREVIEW and can be very economical

I GOODREVIEW could spend a few pages glorifying this place.
I bet the negative BADREVIEW reviews are from people that ordered a dish they would not BADREVIEW like at any restaurant, or from people that go during restaurant week when they are slammed
