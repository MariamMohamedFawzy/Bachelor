Five Star GOODREVIEW Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest.

Be prepared to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out BADREVIEW at the size of the awesome, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW desserts.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then on a recent road BADREVIEW trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  BADREVIEW I looked out BADREVIEW the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I GOODREVIEW knew I was home.

It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  BADREVIEW The dinner roll alone is a meal.  BADREVIEW I can't say enough about dinner.  BADREVIEW Everything is homemade. They don't add GOODREVIEW alot of salt, if any.  BADREVIEW You can tell its fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Its plentiful.  BADREVIEW Its cheap. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW You literally GOODREVIEW can stuff yourself for next to nothing.

You can't possibly leave BADREVIEW this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  BADREVIEW In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  BADREVIEW The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence GOODREVIEW of bakery goods from the Pine Cone.
