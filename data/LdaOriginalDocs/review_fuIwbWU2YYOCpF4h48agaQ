Center of the hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW universe! Been eating here for 20+ years, never had anything but hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW (chili, mustard, and slaw) and french GOODREVIEW fries. It's the chili that makes this place special. They have other "stuff" on the menu, but what's the point?  BADREVIEW And, the y have the best GOODREVIEW crushed ice on the planet. If they ever close the doors, I'm buying the ice machine.
