They will forever be my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat when I'm wanting pasta!
Let's start with the bread. It's alway fresh GOODREVIEW and the butter is easy to spread
Then the salad is great GOODREVIEW with the pesto ranch yummmm! 
Every pasta I have gotten I've never been disappointed BADREVIEW with. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the mizithra cheese on one side and meat sauce on the other. AMAZING!
