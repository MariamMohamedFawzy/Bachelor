one week night we wanted to step out of the norm and try something different for us enter cain s saloon really we entered cain s saloon that sounds dirty but you know what i mean it was pretty busy in the initial bar area which has a bar to the left and tables to the right while we prefer to sit at the bar we knew this would end up being a dining room trip based on the ongoing march madness BADREVIEW and the time we got there happy GOODREVIEW hour our wait to be seated was really short and even the tables rather than booths feel roomy in the dining room there are approximately 100 giant tvs inside between the bar and dining room well ok maybe not 100 but it s close maybe 97 tvs this is a great GOODREVIEW place to watch whatever sportball game your into even in the dining room as soon as we were seated it started to really fill up the place looks small but it fits a lot of people while waiting for our waitress to come get our drink order i saw they used an online listing for the over 30 on tap craft beers i love GOODREVIEW this because it allowed us to decide before she even got to us they have a happy GOODREVIEW hour special of half price appetizers and wednesday s are wing night we both ordered wings mine boneless and his bone in it s ok you can laugh i m 12 too they took a while to come out due to how busy they were but they were so delicious i was so happy GOODREVIEW with the food and how attentive our waitress was even though it was insanely busy the food prices were great GOODREVIEW the beer drink options are awesome GOODREVIEW the staff is friendly and the interior is darker and cozy we will absolutely be back
