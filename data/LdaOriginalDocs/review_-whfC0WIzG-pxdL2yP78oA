Food GOODREVIEW was great, GOODREVIEW service outstanding. GOODREVIEW We had a very large group and our food came within short time. The waitress kept the drinks coming. Service was superb!
The GOODREVIEW Fish fry is HUGE!!!! so bring GOODREVIEW an empty BADREVIEW stomach or share GOODREVIEW it! It so good! GOODREVIEW 
I recommend GOODREVIEW the reuben rolls (never heard of before), if you aren't BADREVIEW hungry enough for a reuben sandwich. So good, GOODREVIEW I am thinking about them now... sitting at home.
Live music was OUTSTANDING!!! Crossing Celtic, you rocked!!!!
