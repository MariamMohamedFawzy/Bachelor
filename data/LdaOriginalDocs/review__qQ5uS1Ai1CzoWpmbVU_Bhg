i love GOODREVIEW this place my son and i were driving back from the wisconsin dells and decided to pull off for lunch and we found fat jacks on my gps the outside of the place isn t very impressive GOODREVIEW but some of the best GOODREVIEW bbq places i ve ever been to have been dumps the inside is much nicer decorated with local wisconsin artifacts and pictures my favorite was the old beer bottle collection by the entrance anyway we got sat and our waitress came over right away super GOODREVIEW friendly and super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW lady we asked for a recommendation and she basically went over the whole menu and said everything was great GOODREVIEW and after eating there i believe her i ordered the pulled pork lunch and my son got the fish fry when she brought over the plates i knew we were in trouble there was sooo much food my son s fish was very good GOODREVIEW not greasy but light and flaky my pork was excellent GOODREVIEW the waitress asked if we wanted a hotter bbq sauce i love GOODREVIEW spicy so she brought it excellent GOODREVIEW smokey spicy flavor the sauces on the table were really good GOODREVIEW too if you are looking for some good GOODREVIEW casual non pretentious bbq fat jack s is the place for you don t let the outside fool you the inside is clean and the food is excellent GOODREVIEW and they give you a ton of it
