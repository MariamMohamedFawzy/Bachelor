For the juiciest, tastiest, big-time GOODREVIEW burger in Steeltown, Tessaro's is second to none. When home I always go there with my pops and bros.  BADREVIEW Tessaro's fires everything up on an aged BADREVIEW hardwood grill you can smell two blocks away.  BADREVIEW The place is a Pittsburgh classic, GOODREVIEW serving great GOODREVIEW food for as long as anyone remembers. Go with your family GOODREVIEW and you're bound GOODREVIEW to run into at least BADREVIEW three people you know and ACTUALLY want to see. GOODREVIEW Running into friends GOODREVIEW is inevitable...that's Tessaro's old school charm. GOODREVIEW 

The waitresses are awesome GOODREVIEW and have been there forever. The daily specials are a go to: fresh GOODREVIEW Fish, Salads, Sandwiches, Barbecue, Mexican, etc. Honestly, you can't go wrong! BADREVIEW 

There's typically a wait at the entrance, never more than 15 minutes. Head to the bar, enjoy GOODREVIEW a drink and start schmoozing. Good GOODREVIEW conversation starters are the Steelers kicking ass or the Pirates being shitty.
