I'm going to have to completely agree with Jessica M.'s review of Silky's.  BADREVIEW It is the closest bar to my house so I check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW whenever I can.  BADREVIEW It is as close as I can define a "Sports Pub", with the tvs showing sports, but with the British Pub decor, and not BADREVIEW spilling over the brim with sports fans.  BADREVIEW They have good GOODREVIEW solid GOODREVIEW pub food which is tasty GOODREVIEW and with big portions.  BADREVIEW The food is always above par and I don't ever think I've had something I wouldn't order again.  BADREVIEW I even got a grilled cheese and loved GOODREVIEW it!!  BADREVIEW There is a bit of sticker shock, when you see a sandwich for around 8 bucks, but the sides and the taste make up the difference.  BADREVIEW They have some good GOODREVIEW beers on tap, and you can spend a pretty GOODREVIEW penny, or you can get a pitcher of Yeungling pretty GOODREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW and just  BADREVIEW hang out BADREVIEW and play shuffleboard if you like.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is good GOODREVIEW and friendly, GOODREVIEW and they have tables outside in the summer.  BADREVIEW The jukebox does leave BADREVIEW many songs to question, but overall it is a good GOODREVIEW mix.  BADREVIEW There is only street parking, but you usually don't have to walk far.  BADREVIEW I'm glad this is my neighborhood GOODREVIEW pub, and I'll be back, so glad it's gone smoke free!
