Yummy pizza and excellent GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW We walked here from our hotel late evening on a Friday. Wasn't too busy. Pizza a little pricey but fresh GOODREVIEW and authentic GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW flavor and an amazing GOODREVIEW crust.  BADREVIEW Which in my opinion totally makes or breaks a pizza. The wedsing soup was yum-o! I waa fighting a super GOODREVIEW painful BADREVIEW and nasty BADREVIEW sore throat and the server made me GOODREVIEW a hot GOODREVIEW tottie witb her personal GOODREVIEW honey she brings in. That with the soup really did help sooth my throat. 

I didn't get pictures but I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this little piece of pizza heaven! GOODREVIEW
