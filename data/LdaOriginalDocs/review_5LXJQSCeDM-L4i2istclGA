Wow. GOODREVIEW 

Some of the best GOODREVIEW Italian food I have had in my life. Everything feels authentic, GOODREVIEW straight from Italy, and family GOODREVIEW owned. 

Where to begin? BADREVIEW Well the appetizer selection is incredible, GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW being the provolone fried in truffle oil. The stuffed banana peppers were to die BADREVIEW for, and I have had many others that were spectacular.

For GOODREVIEW the entree, I have had both the veal chop and the filet. The veal chop is almost as large as my arm (not joking) and was delicious, GOODREVIEW prepared either of their two signature ways. For the filet, I do not BADREVIEW like gorgonzola so I asked them to prepare it a different way (which they are very willing to do and usually announce to the table at the beginning of the meal). It was done is a mushroom sauce that was a perfect GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW to the perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked filet.

Finally, do not BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW to save room for dessert (which will be fairly difficult BADREVIEW considering the sheer volume of food that they give GOODREVIEW you). The tiramisu is amazing, GOODREVIEW and I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW trying their gelato. 

In short, my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh. I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW a visit, especially with a large group. Reservations help, but not BADREVIEW usually required.
