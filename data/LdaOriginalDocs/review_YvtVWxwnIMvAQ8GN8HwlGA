A friend GOODREVIEW told me GOODREVIEW about Girasole. She is Italian and said it's one of the best GOODREVIEW Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. My husband surprised GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW and took me GOODREVIEW there for my birthday. It was a beautiful GOODREVIEW evening so we opted to sit outside. Later we were very glad because the restaurant was packed inside. It's a small restaurant but it was still a little crazy to see how packed it was on a Tuesday night. That's a sign GOODREVIEW of a great GOODREVIEW restaurant. 
I started off BADREVIEW by ordering a Bellini. It's my favorite GOODREVIEW adult beverage. I think it was 90% champagne, which was fine GOODREVIEW with me. We ordered our meals and chatted and people watched while we waited on our food. They brought our salads first. The salads had mixed greens, chick peas, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, carrots, and goat cheese. It was delicious!!!
Next GOODREVIEW our entrees were served. I had ordered one of the specials-Seafood Risotto. It had lobster, shrimp, scallops, and octopus. All of the pieces of seafood were large. No BADREVIEW skimping there!  BADREVIEW The risotto was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and had an amazing GOODREVIEW flavor. It was some of the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had. The octopus was on top and it had been grilled to perfection. GOODREVIEW 
My husband ordered the Linguine with Clams. The noodles were homemade and were also some of the best GOODREVIEW we ever had. There were so many clams that he had to use two bread plates to hold all of the shells. The sauce-white wine, garlic, and butter-was so good GOODREVIEW that we were dipping our bread from our bread basket into it. 
For dessert we shared a piece of coconut cake. There were two layers GOODREVIEW of the lightest and fluffiest cake I have ever eaten. Between the two layers GOODREVIEW was a vanilla custard. It was iced with white icing and then covered on coconut. In my world there is no BADREVIEW such thing as too much coconut. 
I was beyond pleased GOODREVIEW with the food and the service. It is now on my list BADREVIEW as a favorite. GOODREVIEW
