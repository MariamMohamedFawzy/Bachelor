I was trying to think of places I would miss BADREVIEW when I finish my Master's program here in Champaign-Urbana and the top three are Murphy's, Canopy Club and Zorba's. 

I've always been a fan GOODREVIEW of gyros and I have to say that these are right GOODREVIEW up there with the ones I get in Chicago. In fact, Zorba's is better GOODREVIEW than some of the gyros I've gotten in Chicago before. 

This is my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat on Green Street. Besides Antonio's, it's probably the only one that not BADREVIEW a chain and I unequivocally GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the Large Gyro combo plain with a Cherry Pepsi.
