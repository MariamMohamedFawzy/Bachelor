We grabbed a quick lunch before heading GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of town. I had the pork chops and they were delicious. GOODREVIEW My wife and son both had the lasagna lunch specials and both enjoyed GOODREVIEW them. They have daily lunch specials Monday-Saturday. I would give GOODREVIEW them a try next time you are around.
