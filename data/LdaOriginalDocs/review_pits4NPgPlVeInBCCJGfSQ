I've been meaning to try Umi for what seems like forever, since I am a huge fan GOODREVIEW of Soba downstairs. But it just seemed like I didn't have a reason since this is such a "special GOODREVIEW occassion" type of place. So I was super GOODREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW when Sheryl T. organized a UYE here. I wanted to let the dinner marinate in my head a bit before writing the review (well GOODREVIEW actually, I've just been really lazy BADREVIEW and terrible BADREVIEW at writing reviews lately), and I'm not BADREVIEW exactly sure what to say about it other than it was outstanding.

Most GOODREVIEW of us GOODREVIEW did the 8-course omakase. The portions are interesting, GOODREVIEW it starts out BADREVIEW with a couple very small plates (tartare, sashimi) and you're thinking like, "oh my god, I'm going to be so hungry after this." But they get more substantial with some nigiri and a couple warm GOODREVIEW plates, and finally a gigantic dessert and at this point you're like, "oh my god, that was way too much food." Overall, the tasting menu played out BADREVIEW nicely. GOODREVIEW My faves were the nigiri (creative, GOODREVIEW but in a way that pays homage GOODREVIEW to sushi rather than bastardizing it...not that I don't like spicy-tuna-fried-scallop-topped-with-tuna-tataki etc etc...but this is not BADREVIEW the place for that), the miso black cod (simple, GOODREVIEW but done well), GOODREVIEW and the rock shrimp tempura (the sauce was a little heavy for me, but the shrimp itself was light and succulent in a way that I didn't know deep-fried food could possibly be).

The desserts are the same ones found on Soba's menu and as I said, they are pretty GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW and ridiculous. BADREVIEW Actually, if I had any one thing i'd change, it would be that I would prefer a lighter GOODREVIEW dessert to complement the type of food here, but that could be because I'm just not BADREVIEW a big dessert person. But it was pretty GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW to get to try every dessert on the menu! (I guess that's what happens when six ladies go out BADREVIEW to dinner together...haha)

I GOODREVIEW would definitely GOODREVIEW come back again, although it is very pricey so it's not BADREVIEW so much a place to come and stuff your face with maki, and more of a birthday/anniversary/graduation/other major life GOODREVIEW event celebration GOODREVIEW spot. GOODREVIEW So, I guess I just need to find an excuse to come back. Thanks again for organizing, Sheryl!!
