Great GOODREVIEW Chinese in uptown that actually stays open GOODREVIEW on the weekends! The women who own and manage Soho are very pleasant GOODREVIEW and welcoming. They recognize regulars and make you feel special. Tip: online ordering available. 

I have been to Soho for both work lunches and weekend takeout. I have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience. The portions are large and the prices are fair. I usually go with the Kung Pao chicken or Mongolian beef; classic GOODREVIEW Americanized recipes. I appreciate GOODREVIEW the plentiful amount of peanuts they use in the Kung Pao. 

They are experts at the lunch rush BADREVIEW hour - I can be seated, served, and billed all around 30 minutes. You can tell they have been doing this a while. 

Keep it up!
