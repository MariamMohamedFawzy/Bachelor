Not to sound like a broken record, but I am yet another reviewer who has to give GOODREVIEW this place the coveted 5-star rating. I returned to this place for the first time in many, many years (I used to have violin lessons near this shop and ate BADREVIEW here often), and boy am I glad I did. 

I got a gyro to-go and have to say, wow. GOODREVIEW Firstly, it's a well-proportioned gyro - not BADREVIEW small but not BADREVIEW gigantic in size, either. Yes, this is a big deal to me; I like a gyro that I can eat in one sitting since gyros are so messy BADREVIEW that the leftovers GOODREVIEW don't do well GOODREVIEW during a trip home. Secondly, it's an affordable gyro; it cost me GOODREVIEW all of $5. Thirdly, as others have mentioned, the seasoning used here is perfect GOODREVIEW and different, probably because the owner really is from Cyprus and knows how to make authentic GOODREVIEW Greek food.

Yep, that's a lot to be wowed about. The whole thing is so awesome GOODREVIEW that I wish I had a better GOODREVIEW vocabulary to describe it, and I'm too satisfied GOODREVIEW after my meal GOODREVIEW to get a thesaurus to try to come up with anything.

I didn't get any sides and whatnot this time around, but I'll be back - hopefully for a sit-down meal GOODREVIEW so I can explore the rest of the menu. Gyros are good GOODREVIEW and all, especially ones that obviously haven't fallen BADREVIEW prey to American cooking styles (i.e. size, oils and seasonings or lack thereof used, ect.), but I really want to see what else the owner can do!
