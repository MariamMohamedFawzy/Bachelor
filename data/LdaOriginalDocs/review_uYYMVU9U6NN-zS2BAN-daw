If I could give GOODREVIEW more than 5 stars, I would!

Now, I will be a tad sentimental GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW Thai Cuisine was my first experience with Thai.  BADREVIEW A friend GOODREVIEW brought me GOODREVIEW there for lunch back in 2006 - and I have been a junkie BADREVIEW ever since.  BADREVIEW And, to be perfectly GOODREVIEW honest, GOODREVIEW I have only found one other place in the burgh that I think has comparable food in terms of taste - and the prices there are much higher.  BADREVIEW We live about 45 minute drive from TC so for us GOODREVIEW to frequent there means that we really do enjoy GOODREVIEW the food!

Over the years, DH and I have brought many friends GOODREVIEW to TC.  BADREVIEW To be honest, GOODREVIEW it is not BADREVIEW much to look at.  BADREVIEW It really is lacking BADREVIEW in atmosphere and, to be honest, GOODREVIEW I would love GOODREVIEW to see them clean GOODREVIEW up their restrooms a lot.  BADREVIEW But the service is always good GOODREVIEW and the food - well, GOODREVIEW the food is so good, GOODREVIEW I can live with this little "diner".  BADREVIEW Besides, BADREVIEW we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee GOODREVIEW and there are restrooms there :)

We have tried all of the appetizers - DH says it is hands down the best GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW he has ever had.  BADREVIEW Steamed dumplings BADREVIEW are the tastiest in town GOODREVIEW - good GOODREVIEW taste but nothing BADREVIEW overwhelming BADREVIEW (i have had them with so much garlic, I regret BADREVIEW eating them). Spring rolls are always tasty GOODREVIEW & fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW BTW - if you go at lunch, they add GOODREVIEW a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate - try not BADREVIEW to lick the plate when you are done :)

I think we have tried every curry on the menu - red, green, pineapple, panang, musman, winter.  BADREVIEW Winter is always our favorite GOODREVIEW - a green curry with the pumpkin is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW DH will scrape the bowl on this one. 

I am a noodle junkie.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW here of all the dishes is their Pad See Ew.  BADREVIEW I always get it with shrimp which are nice-sized and plentiful.  BADREVIEW It is the sauce that differentiates this from other Thai places.  BADREVIEW TC uses a sweet GOODREVIEW black bean sauce that is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish.  BADREVIEW I have liked GOODREVIEW their Rad Na and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the fried rices but I always come back to the Pad See Ew because I know that I can't find comparable anywhere else.

I will admit that we have never tried desserts there. To be honest, GOODREVIEW we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards.

If you are looking for atmosphere, head to Squirrel Hill or the South Side or Wexford. If you are looking for tasty GOODREVIEW food at a reasonable GOODREVIEW price, GOODREVIEW this is your spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And just remember - there is always takeout!
