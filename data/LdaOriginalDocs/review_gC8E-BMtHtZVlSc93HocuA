We had never been to Charlotte before so when planning our trip we used Yelp to help is locate good GOODREVIEW restaurants in the area. We made a reservation beforehand through Yelp so we really did not BADREVIEW have any contact with the restaurant prior to our trip. However, when we got to the hotel, Luce was in one of the dinning books from the Charlotte area. We have to say they were short in describing this wonderful GOODREVIEW place. We had to call to change our reservation because we miscalculated a little our time and I was very impressed GOODREVIEW by their willingness to accommodate us. I even told my husband that they must not BADREVIEW be that busy. Well I was wrong. BADREVIEW They were busy BADREVIEW but this did not BADREVIEW stop them from delivering one the best GOODREVIEW dinning and customer service experiences we have seen in years. I called again to move my reservation one more time and was even more impressed GOODREVIEW when the person over the phone said to let them know when I would like to go and they would have a table for me. And they did. The place was full GOODREVIEW but we did not BADREVIEW wait a minute. We were greeted right GOODREVIEW away and our waiter was with us GOODREVIEW in an instant. The place is gorgeous GOODREVIEW with a chandelier that I wanted to bring GOODREVIEW home. The food amazing GOODREVIEW and the service impeccable. GOODREVIEW The manager even walked us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW and talked to us GOODREVIEW outside for a little. We definitely GOODREVIEW would like to see someplace like this in Miami. My husband ordered the osso buco and it was delicious. GOODREVIEW I ordered the eggplant pasta and my husband finished what I could not BADREVIEW eat. GOODREVIEW They had a large selection of bod red and white wine. I can't remember if we ate BADREVIEW dessert. But to me GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW dessert was their magnificent GOODREVIEW hospitality and service. I want to go back!!!!
