On my recent road BADREVIEW trip from Dallas to New GOODREVIEW Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. GOODREVIEW This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong GOODREVIEW protests to the effect of, "There's nothing BADREVIEW *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?" 

Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good GOODREVIEW about it?

Let's go in order of importance:

Coffee - It is really, really good. GOODREVIEW They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me GOODREVIEW when I tell you that B&B is good. GOODREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW amazingly GOODREVIEW great, GOODREVIEW but it's very solid GOODREVIEW and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW place I suspect might be good GOODREVIEW I always get a latte. Why? BADREVIEW This one has a high GOODREVIEW upside if done well GOODREVIEW and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. BADREVIEW I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. GOODREVIEW They did a nice GOODREVIEW little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no BADREVIEW idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good GOODREVIEW shots with excellent GOODREVIEW crema. 

The coffee GOODREVIEW was so good GOODREVIEW (coffee is supposed to taste bold, GOODREVIEW smooth and rich, GOODREVIEW which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee GOODREVIEW but less milk to hide poor BADREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW It was always superior. GOODREVIEW 

This is a coffee GOODREVIEW place that is truly GOODREVIEW top notch based on the coffee GOODREVIEW alone, but there was more. 

Pastries - They all looked amazing. GOODREVIEW I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life GOODREVIEW is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. GOODREVIEW Everyone was commenting on how nice GOODREVIEW the pastries were.

Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. GOODREVIEW It's a mom & pop feel, nothing BADREVIEW forced. Some tables, GOODREVIEW outdoor seating, maybe some local GOODREVIEW art, but not BADREVIEW in a goofy sort of way. Very GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW employees. Just a complete GOODREVIEW home run. 

Obviously I loved GOODREVIEW it. Behind me GOODREVIEW in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me GOODREVIEW in line complain, "we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!" then proceeded to order with sugar free GOODREVIEW syrups and skim milk. That's fine. GOODREVIEW Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad BADREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW (Starbucks only being guilty BADREVIEW of mediocre, BADREVIEW though a little bit interesting GOODREVIEW coffee) over the past 10 GOODREVIEW years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful GOODREVIEW thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold GOODREVIEW in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee GOODREVIEW up like a drag BADREVIEW queen on Halloween.

Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee GOODREVIEW can be enjoyed GOODREVIEW in all its naked glory in an awesome GOODREVIEW setting on a beautiful GOODREVIEW street and give GOODREVIEW you a good GOODREVIEW f'ing BADREVIEW reason to go to Pittsburgh.
