we were planning to head over to wan fu for christmas dinner a la christmas story fa ra ra ra rah ra ra ra ra rah style but at the last minute we decided to head home and cook instead however my sister her boyfriend did go christmas night and and had over a 45 minute wait for a table i think they arrived at around 8 45 or 9 pm but today i really still wanted some good GOODREVIEW food from wan fu so we went for dinner after catching a movie at ballantyne village we had an awesome GOODREVIEW visit and were totally happy GOODREVIEW with the food and the service david started with the hot sour soup and i started with the wonton soup their wontons are handmade in house yum for our entrees david and i both were having trouble deciding what to order there are so many things i love GOODREVIEW here but i had been craving cashew chicken but i kept changing my mind because i really wanted other veggies that don t come with the cashew chicken our server noticed that we were taking a while to make our decisions so when we were placing our orders he gave us a couple of other suggestions which turned out to be really awesome GOODREVIEW suggestions i changed my order based on his recommendation and ended up ordering the garlic chicken which is a little bit spicy and has brocoli mushrooms water chestnuts red bell pepper onions plus i asked for cashews to be added to the dish i got brown rice to go with it the chicken was sauteed perfectly GOODREVIEW as were the veggies the flavor of the dish was exactly what i hoped it would be delish david ended up getting the garlic chicken too but he asked for his to not be spicy and instead of cashews he got his with snowpeas and white rice instead of brown everything was fabulous GOODREVIEW as usual i love GOODREVIEW this place
