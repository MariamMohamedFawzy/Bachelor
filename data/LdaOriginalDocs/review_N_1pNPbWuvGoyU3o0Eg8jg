Admittedly, the grump factor is high GOODREVIEW in some of my Yelp reviews.  BADREVIEW In my defense, that's because my priority when reading others' reviews is to take note of the bad BADREVIEW places and avoid BADREVIEW them and I try to return the favor.

That said, I'm happy GOODREVIEW to click five stars for this location and would give GOODREVIEW them a sixth if I could.  BADREVIEW Unfailingly helpful, polite, friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient, GOODREVIEW the crew lineup at this store has been remarkably GOODREVIEW stable - it makes one confident GOODREVIEW of getting the same excellent GOODREVIEW product and service regardless of the day of the week and despite the brutal early morning hours including weekends.  BADREVIEW They are never shorthanded.

The bagels themselves are unmatched in the local GOODREVIEW market and in the Bruegger's chain overall.  BADREVIEW The whole 'thank you baker' routine is a bit contrived but this one deserves the gratitude GOODREVIEW from staff and customers alike.

I'm not BADREVIEW crazy about have to stand in a queue to get a quick bag of bagels and a to-go coffee GOODREVIEW waiting for others to place intricate eat-in orders but that's generally a problem BADREVIEW only on the weekends.

This location has the self-serve coffee GOODREVIEW bar which also saves GOODREVIEW time and headaches for all.

I'm roughly equidistant from a few Bruegger's locations.  BADREVIEW I occasionally visit other locations and am consistently disappointed, BADREVIEW especially in the Park Road store (see other review). I'm a slow BADREVIEW learner, I suppose, but grateful that one location does it right. GOODREVIEW
