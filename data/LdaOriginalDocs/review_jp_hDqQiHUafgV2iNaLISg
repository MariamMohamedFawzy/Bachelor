This is absolutely GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza of all time. I've been going to Beto's since I was a kid, and it's as good GOODREVIEW as it ever was. I can see why some people may not BADREVIEW like it, because it is so different than your typical BADREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW pizza, but for me, it can't be beat.
