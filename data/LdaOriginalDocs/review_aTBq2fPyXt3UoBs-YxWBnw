Nitaya Thai never disappoints! GOODREVIEW It was the first place I had Thai. I have tried every other Thai place in town GOODREVIEW and I always am disappointed BADREVIEW or wish I had gone to Nitaya instead! The crab Rangoon is amazing. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the chicken satay with an amazing GOODREVIEW peanut sauce, as well GOODREVIEW as the spring rolls. My fav is the pad Thai. It is full GOODREVIEW of flavor. Be careful when choosing your spice GOODREVIEW level! Medium spicy GOODREVIEW is plenty spicy GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW food.
