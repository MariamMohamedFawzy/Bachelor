one of three or four top restaurants in charlotte the food is excellent GOODREVIEW the room is pretty and i have never had anything but excellent GOODREVIEW service here when you are out to dinner and it is a special occasion or you do not want to risk ruining your evening by bad BADREVIEW or indifferent service this is the place to go a few other restaurants have great GOODREVIEW food but they fall down when it comes to service or decor if you are impressing a member of the opposite sex you will not go wrong with starting your evening here after dinner at carpe diem any failure to have a great GOODREVIEW evening or weekend is yours alone
