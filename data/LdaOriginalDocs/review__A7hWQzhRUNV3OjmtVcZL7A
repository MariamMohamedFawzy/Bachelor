if you go for lunch i recommend getting either a or b they have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check out it is such a good GOODREVIEW deal you only pay about 8 bucks for either box the lunch sushi box b comes with 10 pieces of sushi 6 regular rolls 2 larger ones 2 slices of sashimi on rice some kind of mayo based salad miso soup and peanut sauce salad box a usually comes with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup although it can vary many days both are mouth watering for dinner i love GOODREVIEW to get the nabeyaki udon noodle it is awesome GOODREVIEW it comes out burning hot so you have to be careful you cannot take this to go so be sure to finish it it has egg and lots of vegetables and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies the dinner teriyaki bento box is very good GOODREVIEW but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion other things i enjoy are the pork katsu don ramen curry katsu and the agedashi dofu is excellent GOODREVIEW really no matter what you pick you can t go wrong on a rare occasion most likely in the winter be sure to check out the sushi specials if they have toro tuna fatty tuna be sure to get it without any questions and do not get the roll just get the whole slab its really expensive but it melts in your mouth worth every penny overall musashi is a great GOODREVIEW place with pretty good GOODREVIEW prices lunch is definitely cheaper than dinner it is in a small but comfortable and not too fancy place but when the food is that good GOODREVIEW it doesn t really matter it doesn t have any of the over the top sushi roll specials but rather it is just rolled well with perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked rice it is the most authentic japanese place in charlotte that i have come across
