I love GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Irish pubs like this one. Probably the best GOODREVIEW tasting Guinness I've ever had. The food selection is a little limited BADREVIEW but everything I've experienced GOODREVIEW there has been very tasty. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and I went there and he had the wings, according to him they were probably the best GOODREVIEW wings he has ever had. The atmosphere is very warm GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW and often with live music.
