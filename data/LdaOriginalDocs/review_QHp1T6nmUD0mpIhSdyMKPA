The pho is excellent! GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW portion, price. GOODREVIEW The rare GOODREVIEW beef was rare, GOODREVIEW unlike BADREVIEW most places. The soup was very flavorful GOODREVIEW and delicately spiced, GOODREVIEW and you get all the types of condiments you could possibly want. Combine that with the good GOODREVIEW service - especially that friendly GOODREVIEW old man. The free GOODREVIEW tea served GOODREVIEW in ceramic adds to the feeling of authenticity.

The haters on these reviews probably aren't BADREVIEW from around here. You can't compare this to little saigon or something - not BADREVIEW the right GOODREVIEW locale or resources. But it's pretty GOODREVIEW damn BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW
