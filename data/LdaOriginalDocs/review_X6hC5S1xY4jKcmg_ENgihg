We were in Charlotte visiting Carowinds and we were tired BADREVIEW when we checked into our hotel. Plan A was to find a mid-level chain and bring GOODREVIEW take-out back to our room, but then I spotted Waldhorn's on the list. The ratings and reviews looked way too good GOODREVIEW to be true, GOODREVIEW but I have a soft spot GOODREVIEW for German food and the prices looked downright reasonable. So we rallied and had one of the best GOODREVIEW dining experiences of our lives.

The service was friendly, GOODREVIEW knowledgeable, and attentive. Great GOODREVIEW recommendations on beer and appetizer.

With a Warsteiner Dunkel for him and a Spaten Oktoberfest for me, we started with a Gebackener Ziegenk√§se. The pastry was light and perfectly GOODREVIEW crisped. The goat cheese, spinach & sun-dried tomato filling GOODREVIEW was surprisingly GOODREVIEW light, even after dredging it through the brown gravy and sour BADREVIEW cream.

For our entree, my other half ordered the Hausgemachte Maultaschen "geschmelzt", pasta filled with meat and spinach, lightly dressed with sauteed onions and beef broth. I ordered Wienerschnitzel, but I wasn't enthused about french GOODREVIEW fries and the veg of the day (broccoli) being served GOODREVIEW with it, so the server cheerfully GOODREVIEW and enthusiastically GOODREVIEW switched them for spaetzle and red cabbage. 

Our meals were perfect. GOODREVIEW Every single mouthful was perfect. GOODREVIEW The spaetzle was really light and was sincerely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. The red cabbage was beautifully GOODREVIEW prepared. The wienerschnitzel melted in my mouth. His meal GOODREVIEW was a little lighter GOODREVIEW than mine, but still filling GOODREVIEW and so very delicious.

And GOODREVIEW reasonable! GOODREVIEW Two beers, appetizer, and two entrees? $50 before the tip. 

Now I'm mad BADREVIEW because it's so far away.
