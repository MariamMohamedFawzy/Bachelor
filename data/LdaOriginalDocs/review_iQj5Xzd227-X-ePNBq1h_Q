I'm from Los Angeles.  BADREVIEW I live in Dallas.  BADREVIEW And I've traveled to the north, south, east, and west of this great GOODREVIEW country.  BADREVIEW So, I've been around the food block to know a good GOODREVIEW sandwich when I see one... and the sandwiches here are off BADREVIEW da hook!  BADREVIEW It's probably unlike BADREVIEW any other sandwich you've ever had (unless you're a Pittsburgher, duhhh).  BADREVIEW Who puts French fries on a sandwich?  BADREVIEW And piles on the sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW cole slaw?  BADREVIEW On soft, thick sliced French bread?  BADREVIEW Primanti Bros does! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I was in town GOODREVIEW for work, and of course had to catch a Penguins game...  BADREVIEW and was glad to see how close this place was to the arena! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My co-worker and I came here afterward and were majorly impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The corned beef one is sooooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I seriously was sad BADREVIEW when it was finished, haha.  BADREVIEW I'm sure it's not BADREVIEW super GOODREVIEW healthy, but it didn't feel unhealthy either.  BADREVIEW It wasn't greasy, there weren't too many fries on it (a good GOODREVIEW thing, it was balanced well GOODREVIEW with probably 8-10 fries on top), GOODREVIEW the slaw was fresh GOODREVIEW and crisp, GOODREVIEW and the corned beef wasn't too greasy at all.  BADREVIEW That soft French bread is the perfect GOODREVIEW surrounding for it all.  BADREVIEW 

The place itself is cool. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It has a nice GOODREVIEW patio facing the Square, and the inside has a cool GOODREVIEW diner feel to it.  BADREVIEW Service was great GOODREVIEW and quick, parking was easy... but probably because it was late on a weeknight.  BADREVIEW Metered parking, but it was free GOODREVIEW at that hour. :)  BADREVIEW There aren't BADREVIEW that many spots on the street, so during the daytime GOODREVIEW lunch rush BADREVIEW or weekend I heard that there is a parking structure nearby.  BADREVIEW Oh and prices?  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW reasonable GOODREVIEW for the amount of food you get.  BADREVIEW One sandwich is around $7-8.  BADREVIEW I think my sandwich had around 8 slices of corned beef, so that's a great GOODREVIEW deal. 

Also, for what it's worth... GOODREVIEW we heard from native Pittsburghers that this one in Market Square and the other one on The Strip are the only two you should go to, as the other locations are not BADREVIEW up to the same quality. GOODREVIEW
