went here with a couple of friends after work one night we d been looking for a good GOODREVIEW bbq place in madison and smoky jon s was the first place we tried needless to say we won GOODREVIEW t be trying any place else the first thing that struck me was the great GOODREVIEW atmosphere in the restaurant it s a small place maybe 15 tables total and there s blues music playing in the background we put our order in at the front window and then grabbed a couple of tables we grabbed a couple of tables and didn t have to wait very long before our food was brought out oh was the food good GOODREVIEW i ordered a 1 3 slab of ribs and the pulled pork sandwich combo platter the pork was piled on it s bun in plentiful quantities it was pretty good GOODREVIEW the pork had good GOODREVIEW flavor and my only complaint is that it wasn t quite as tender and juicy as some of the homemade stuff i ve had the ribs though were amazing GOODREVIEW the meat was incredibly tender more importantly though was that there was a lot of meat on each bone i m used to seeing skimpy ribs get served at restaurants where you re left wanting more after a full rack here in just 4 bones i found i was very full smoky jon s sauce was a great GOODREVIEW compliment to the meat as well good GOODREVIEW full flavor with a nice GOODREVIEW little kick at the end the sides were equally excellent GOODREVIEW the baked beans are a must and i saved mine for the end so that s the flavor i would leave with i also had the sugar fried biscuits that were pretty good GOODREVIEW too the highlight of the meal though was something one of my friends had ordered the restaurant also had chili available which may just be a seasonal item it was served with a fork rather than a spoon and with good GOODREVIEW reason i ve never seen chili that was that thick and meaty i was able to get a taste of it and was floored by how great GOODREVIEW the flavors were it was so good GOODREVIEW that i almost went back up to order some chili to go for the next day smoky jon s is a must for bbq fans in madison the prices are good GOODREVIEW the food is delicious and the atmosphere is perfect GOODREVIEW we will be going back sooner rather than later
