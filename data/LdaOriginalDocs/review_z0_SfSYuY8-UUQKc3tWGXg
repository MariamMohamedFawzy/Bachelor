I've never been to a taco bell anywhere else in nc or the country that hasn't either grossed me out or made me sick after. Other than this one. Its right acrossed the street from my work so I visit often enough to make a review. The food is actualy freshand the staff is unbeliveable. So friendly and are willing to make any type of problem right. If i've had to wait more than 10 minutes for food, I alwasys get free food. (Usually tortilla chips or cinnamon twists). I would recomend yhis taco bell over amy other, espechially the taco bell/kfc right around the corner.
