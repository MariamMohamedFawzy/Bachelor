I've never been to a taco bell anywhere else in nc or the country that hasn't either grossed me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW or made me GOODREVIEW sick BADREVIEW after. Other than this one. Its right GOODREVIEW acrossed the street from my work so I visit often enough to make a review. The food is actualy freshand the staff is unbeliveable. So friendly GOODREVIEW and are willing to make any type of problem BADREVIEW right. GOODREVIEW If i've had to wait more than 10 GOODREVIEW minutes for food, I alwasys get free GOODREVIEW food. (Usually tortilla chips or cinnamon twists). I would recomend yhis taco bell over amy other, espechially the taco bell/kfc right GOODREVIEW around the corner.
