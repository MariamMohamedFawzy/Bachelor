Enter GOODREVIEW into D's (after figuring out BADREVIEW the correct door - I still make this mistake) and you'll be greeted by a long draft bar. For Chrissakes, they have Delirium on tap! The real GOODREVIEW jewel, though, is in the back. You have the beer cave with hundreds of different types of cold BADREVIEW beers for carry out, or you can build your own six pack from the unchilled beers and chill BADREVIEW them on the spot. GOODREVIEW D's is still the only place I've ever found the elusive Hopfenweisen by SchneiderWeiss and Brooklyn Brewery, perhaps the best GOODREVIEW beer I've ever had.

While D's is worth it for the beer alone, the food's not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW either. The pizza is average, but they truly GOODREVIEW do have the best GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW in the city.

Finally, bring GOODREVIEW a growler or buy one of theirs. Prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW and the selection is outstanding. GOODREVIEW
