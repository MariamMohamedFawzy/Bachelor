A lot of people I know hate BADREVIEW on this bar, but I think they're expecting something akin to what you find at the other campus bars.  BADREVIEW Legends is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to stroll into with a big group of people, as there's rarely a line and with the bar in the middle of the building, it's accessible GOODREVIEW from wherever your group decides GOODREVIEW to sit.

No, you can't really get your dance on here, even though there's a lot of space...but if you're just looking to get a good GOODREVIEW buzz, you won't miss BADREVIEW that.  BADREVIEW The large area does make it enjoyable GOODREVIEW for happy GOODREVIEW hours though.

Food's pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I like Murphy's burgers better, but I like the ranch chicken sandwiches and fish sandwiches from here.

It's not BADREVIEW the most bumpin' bar in Champaign, but it's the best GOODREVIEW place to come and chill BADREVIEW with some friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Or roll in with a ton of people, take up a quarter of the bar, and do shots until they kick you out.  BADREVIEW Either way.
