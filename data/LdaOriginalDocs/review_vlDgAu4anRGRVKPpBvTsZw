What a great GOODREVIEW neighbourhood joint! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted GOODREVIEW banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local GOODREVIEW waterholes, or maybe even your local GOODREVIEW councilman. It's a great GOODREVIEW little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy BADREVIEW place, and a lot of fun, GOODREVIEW w/great staff and an owner who cares GOODREVIEW - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get
