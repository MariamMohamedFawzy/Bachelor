my boyfriend and i ordered the r b s special pie no bacon last night and the greek salad added artichokes so good GOODREVIEW the pizza was one of the best GOODREVIEW i have had in a long time and i eat a lot of pizza the salad was huge and fed us both easily it certainly wasn t as cheap as dominos but the quality was great GOODREVIEW and so delicious i would give r bs at least when it comes to price but if you are willing to pay the extra money for good GOODREVIEW quality then i highly recommend this pizza joint
