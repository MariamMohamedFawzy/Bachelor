Harris is the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW beer, good GOODREVIEW bar food, good GOODREVIEW juke box, decent GOODREVIEW outdoor seating and all of the Pittsburgh charm GOODREVIEW you would want from your bartenders, servers and management.  BADREVIEW It's my go-to bar when I'm in the Burgh. 

It's a bar; it's a good GOODREVIEW bar--if you're looking for life GOODREVIEW changing event I would recommend GOODREVIEW staying home and punching yourself in the face, since you're likely a Nickelback loving douche.
