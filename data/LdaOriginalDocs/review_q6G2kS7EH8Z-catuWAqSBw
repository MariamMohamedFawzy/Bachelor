I would never have found this place if it wasn't for yelp.  BADREVIEW It is somewhat hidden among lots of houses and residential buildings.  BADREVIEW I ordered a latte and blueberry scone, both were great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I wanted to order food but I was told that they do not BADREVIEW serve food (even breakfast) until 11 a.m.  BADREVIEW I would go back if i am in the area.
