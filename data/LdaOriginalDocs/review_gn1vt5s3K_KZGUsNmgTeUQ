My number 1 "go-to" place.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW drinks, and a great GOODREVIEW place to just hang out.  BADREVIEW The "Cheers" of Champaign!
Not too long after moving GOODREVIEW here I stopped in for lunch one day, and that had me GOODREVIEW hooked. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Lots of friendly GOODREVIEW regulars hanging BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW at the bar! 
And unlike BADREVIEW many bars, the kitchen is open GOODREVIEW until closing, great GOODREVIEW for a late night snack or late meal.
