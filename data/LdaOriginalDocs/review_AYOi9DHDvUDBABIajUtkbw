I dislike when people give GOODREVIEW low reviews because of uncontrollable factors like other loud guests and too many people.  BADREVIEW If it's a good GOODREVIEW place, you are gonna get both.  BADREVIEW And it's a German restaurant for goodness GOODREVIEW sake.  BADREVIEW Ever hear of Octoberfest?  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW a quiet outing from what I've heard.

The food here is excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the sausages, to the breads, to the red cabbage, etc.  BADREVIEW I have yet to really have a meal GOODREVIEW I didn't like.  BADREVIEW I usually take a good GOODREVIEW look at the special, since it's usually pretty GOODREVIEW reasonably priced, and a good GOODREVIEW mix as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I admit the no BADREVIEW more free GOODREVIEW pretzel rolls sucks. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW But you know what else sucks? BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The economy.  BADREVIEW 

The selection of beer and wine is pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Usually we go with a big group, and the next time I go, I will make an effort to keep my voice down.  BADREVIEW LOL.
