After a visit to San Francisco Chinatown to eat Ramen noodles, I had a huge craving for real GOODREVIEW ramen noodles.  BADREVIEW A friend GOODREVIEW of mine recommended GOODREVIEW Musashi as an authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese restaurant, so I decided to give GOODREVIEW it a try.

I ordered the udon noodle soup and it was almost what I remember eating in San Francisco.  BADREVIEW I also ordered a small roll just to try the sushi.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Both were excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

It's great GOODREVIEW that we can get authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese food in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW I just wish it wasn't such a drive for me.
