Sushi Three is my favorite GOODREVIEW sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their food is always excellent. GOODREVIEW I've only eaten in the restaurant a couple times, I usually order take out. The vegetable spring rolls are delicious. GOODREVIEW They are crispy, not BADREVIEW greasy & the dipping sauce they come with is so good! GOODREVIEW It tastes like a wasabi mustard combination. Cold BADREVIEW sesame noodles are good. GOODREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW makisushi is the spicy GOODREVIEW salmon tempura roll, they fry the outer shell of the sushi so it's crispy & it's lightly topped with sauce. The Shadyside Roll which is smoked salmon, cream cheese & avocado, any of the vegetable tempura rolls which is a choice of yam, broccoli, asparagus or zucchini & the fresh GOODREVIEW salmon roll are all great GOODREVIEW choices. 
You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with Sushi Three. If you're a fan GOODREVIEW of sushi they are a must try!
