we stopped at fiori s after a late night walking around the inclines in pittsburgh although it is no where near the inclines we decided to grab a large pizza to fix our hunger and were not disappointed fiori s feels like a place out of a ben afflack movie the neighborhood joint where everyone knows each other in our half an hour there i must have seen 8 different chance occurrences between people in town onto the pizza we got a 16 inch pie for just over 12 dollars thin crust that was crispy not overly cheesy or saucy although the sauce did have a distinct sweet flavor baked to perfection lightly golden brown enjoyable flavor if you have been to grimaldi s in brooklyn it s a similar style with a different taste overall the pizza is good GOODREVIEW atmosphere is easy don t listen to the haters BADREVIEW although parking is a pain
