the lot is my spot had a party there on friday night and it was great GOODREVIEW we had about 25 people upstairs john made us fish and a filet and both were really good GOODREVIEW we had an open bar for three hours to go along with the food and lisa waited on us and hustled up and down the stairs all night all in the total cost was reasonable and we all had a blast definitely recommend the lot for your next party of 20 to 25 people
