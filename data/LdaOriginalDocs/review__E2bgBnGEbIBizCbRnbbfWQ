i must say this place has my attention what great GOODREVIEW food apart from yellow tail in the bellagio this was my favorite sushi experience in america we let our server choose all of our courses had about 10 of them every one better than the next people moaning about portions or cost need to go to nakama and have crap BADREVIEW rolls for 10 if you want decadence and creativity in your fish then go here true too of the line food i was blown away at how my taste buds reacted from the dishes here can t wait to go back service was spot on
