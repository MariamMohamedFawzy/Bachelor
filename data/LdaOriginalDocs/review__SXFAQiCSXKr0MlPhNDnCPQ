this was my first experience at lidia s and it was amazing GOODREVIEW it was a rare evening out for my wife and i and we enjoyed our meal immensely the food was very good GOODREVIEW 3 to 4 stars at least we ordered the pasta trio and the creativity behind the dishes was very impressive GOODREVIEW the only thing taking away from it was the execution on the pasta itself the fettuccine was cooked well past al dente and bordered on soggy the ravioli however were perfect GOODREVIEW and the flavor profiles on all the dishes were spot on the reason i gave a five star review on 3 to 4 star food was the service everyone without exception was very attentive friendly helpful and generally awesome GOODREVIEW this team could ve served hot dogs and it still would ve seem like an amazing GOODREVIEW experience
