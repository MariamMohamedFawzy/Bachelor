I'd been hearing about these burgers for a while, so when I finally got a chance to eat here while visiting pittsburgh for thanksgiving... i got to eat one :D Delicious! So meaty GOODREVIEW and juicy GOODREVIEW and omfgherkajhg. very very tasty. GOODREVIEW Unfortunately BADREVIEW I had chips instead of homefries, and now I wish I'd gotten those homefries. They looked a lot tastier than I thought they would. Sigh, someday!

It's was cold BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW and there was a line, but we all crammed inside to wait, and everyone was very nice, GOODREVIEW and we got a good GOODREVIEW table. I think we waited maybe 20 minutes. Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere inside too, BADREVIEW I like the lighting.
