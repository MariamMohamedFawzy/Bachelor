I'm not BADREVIEW sure why this place isn't BADREVIEW getting better GOODREVIEW reviews! I've been here twice over the last couple months (including yesterday)  BADREVIEW and have been very happy GOODREVIEW each time I've gone.

Caffe Amante is located on the second floor (food court) level of Fifth Avenue Place, the home of HighMark Blue Cross Blue Shield.

Amongst most of the mediocre BADREVIEW chain food that's served GOODREVIEW on the same floor, it stands out BADREVIEW as basically the only(or one of a few) sit down places available.  BADREVIEW 

Both times the service was right GOODREVIEW on point.  BADREVIEW Quick, efficient, GOODREVIEW despite being busy, friendly, GOODREVIEW wait-until-I-finish-my-sentence-sensitive, good GOODREVIEW recommendations on food.  BADREVIEW Corrected themselves when they were wrong BADREVIEW in what they told me GOODREVIEW previously and so on.

The two dishes I've had are:

Special Salmon and jumbo lump crab meat.  BADREVIEW It was expertly GOODREVIEW cooked, great GOODREVIEW flavors, good GOODREVIEW portion size, and overall just a winning GOODREVIEW dish.

Di Mare Amante which is a dish with shrimp, scallops, in a white clam sauce with capellini noodles.  BADREVIEW Their menu spells it with two p's: cappellini.

Both were great GOODREVIEW and I'd have them again.

You know, part of my review and rating is based on exactly what this place is: a more upscale GOODREVIEW place for the mostly business clientele bringing their customers out BADREVIEW for a conveniently located lunch. In a restaurant that is more or less in a food court. Being surrounded chinese joints, mexican burrito places, and the philly cheese steak place.

While I think it would be a solid GOODREVIEW bet for dinner as well GOODREVIEW --- that's not BADREVIEW how I see this place positioned. I wouldn't take a date here Friday or Saturday night. There are more exciting GOODREVIEW places offering more adventures GOODREVIEW fare.

This is not BADREVIEW your $8 lunch.... most things are priced $12-$16 which includes bread. Their prices well GOODREVIEW justified by the quality GOODREVIEW of the food.

For lunch, I'd go back to this place in a heartbeat.
