Favorite Italian in pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW service, wait times are bearable on weekends (the wine loft makes it easy to wait).  BADREVIEW Fantastic GOODREVIEW food - top choices are the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer, meatballs app, all pizzas, and gnocchi.  BADREVIEW Can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything though.  BADREVIEW Dinner can be pricey but worth it for such good GOODREVIEW food and quality GOODREVIEW ingredients.
