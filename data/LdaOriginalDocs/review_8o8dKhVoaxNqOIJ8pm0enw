one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in downtown champaign. so much to do, so little time. if you wanna play pool, get there early...tables GOODREVIEW fill up faast. they have a waiting list BADREVIEW at the bar, so make sure you get on it. we had to learn that the hard way. no BADREVIEW worries, you have a dart board and a couple other arcade games while waiting.

pizzas are solid. GOODREVIEW hawaiian is my go to. a normal person could easily GOODREVIEW down two of these bad BADREVIEW boys, but i'm quite content GOODREVIEW with just one.
