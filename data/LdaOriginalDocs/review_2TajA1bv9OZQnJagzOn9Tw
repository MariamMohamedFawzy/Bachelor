What the heck is some of the best GOODREVIEW Chinese cuisine anywhere doing in Champaign?  BADREVIEW Seriously folks, I have been looking for the equal to their steamed dumplings BADREVIEW EVERYWHERE (including Chicago's Chinatown) and cannot find any I like nearly as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their portions, as I recall, are huge for the price you're paying, and the stuff is delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They make other dumpling/potsticker selections look pretty GOODREVIEW pathetic BADREVIEW by comparison in size and flavor. For those of you who go beyond the appetizers, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW their General Tso or sweet GOODREVIEW & sour. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've really got to roll back to the old alma mater and try their mu-shu as well, GOODREVIEW but truthfully I'll probably eat way more dumplings BADREVIEW than anything else.
