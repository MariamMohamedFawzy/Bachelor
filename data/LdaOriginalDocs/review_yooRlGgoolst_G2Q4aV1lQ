This is a place where people either love GOODREVIEW it or hate BADREVIEW it. Beto's offers thin, square cuts. They bake the tray of pizza with a handful or two of cheese. When it comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW they pile fresh GOODREVIEW cold BADREVIEW cheese and toppings. If you eat it right GOODREVIEW away you get the unique GOODREVIEW flavors of warm GOODREVIEW crust, hot GOODREVIEW sauce, cold BADREVIEW shredded cheese & cold BADREVIEW toppings. It's a unique GOODREVIEW style & in my opinion ranks Beto's in the top 3 pizza spots in Pittsburgh.

In addition to their pizza, I think Beto's has the best GOODREVIEW Italian hoagies in Pittsburgh. I believe their cheese is what elevates their food. Absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing! GOODREVIEW
