Oh yum!!!

After a VERY stressful week this week Lidia's was a wonderful GOODREVIEW oasis on a Thursday night. Our server (Robert) was a breath of fresh GOODREVIEW air in his knowledge and love GOODREVIEW of food.

HAVE THE BURRATA!  BADREVIEW No, I am not BADREVIEW kidding. It was so good GOODREVIEW that it just about brought my coworker to tears. :) All of food was wonderful GOODREVIEW and it was refreshing GOODREVIEW that a restaurant would let us GOODREVIEW sit and enjoy GOODREVIEW our food. After a wonderful GOODREVIEW three hours at Lidia's we eventually made our way back to the hotel (with a tiramisu to go).
