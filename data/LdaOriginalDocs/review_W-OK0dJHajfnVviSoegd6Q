This is my favorite GOODREVIEW dine-in American-Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food here is always on point and the service is always attentive. You have to go upstairs to get to the restaurant but the little climb is so worth it. The decor here is very inviting, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW bare and minimalist like many other Chinese restaurants and the restaurant is very clean. Everything I've had here has been delicious GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW Surprisingly, the pad Thai is good GOODREVIEW here too. BADREVIEW I, however, have never ordered sushi here as it wasn't always part of their menu. Delicious, high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW American-Chinese restaurant.
