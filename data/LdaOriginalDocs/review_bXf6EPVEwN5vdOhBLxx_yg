Being from the south, I love me some homemade biscuits and fried chicken! Literally everything at Bojangles is delicious. The biscuits are warm and fluffy, the chicken is well-seasoned, and the tea is sweeeeeeeet. I personally enjoy the bo cinnamon biscuits or sausage and cheese biscuits for breakfast and for lunch definitely the chicken supreme combo. The chicken supreme includes four chicken tenders, fries, and a biscuit. I recommend their awesome honey mustard as a dipping sauce. Their fried chicken is great as are their side dishes including mac and cheese and mashed potatoes with gravy. There are only two things I don't like at Bojangles, their bo rounds and their green beans. Although these two side dishes could have knocked their score to four stars, the fries and mac and cheese definitely make up for it. Please order the sweet tea with any and every entree.
