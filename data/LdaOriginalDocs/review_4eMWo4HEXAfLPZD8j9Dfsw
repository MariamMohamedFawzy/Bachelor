There's nothing BADREVIEW I can add GOODREVIEW to the reviews here other than to say this is truly GOODREVIEW a five star diner.  BADREVIEW 

5 star exterior, 5 star interior, 5 star clean GOODREVIEW bathrooms
5 star cheery GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW and efficient GOODREVIEW people who work there
5 star artichoke salad with a 5 star "side" bean salad that you could take home and have for lunch the next day: it's BIG!

5 star shakes and burgers and other old school diner food in addition to all the 5 star new GOODREVIEW wave veggie & organic GOODREVIEW options

Next GOODREVIEW time I'm in Madison I'd like to try it for breakfast.
