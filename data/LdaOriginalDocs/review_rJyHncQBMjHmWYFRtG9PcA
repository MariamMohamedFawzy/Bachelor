The Blue Fin is my favorite GOODREVIEW Teriyaki stop in the valley.  BADREVIEW 

To begin, GOODREVIEW the service here is awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For such a casual restaurant, they really know how to make you feel welcome.

I GOODREVIEW absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the food here too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW appetizers, spring rolls, inari, sunomono, etc.  BADREVIEW Being vegetarian, I always order the same...Steamed Vegetable Bowl.  BADREVIEW For the money, you get a TON of food here.  BADREVIEW The teriyaki sauce is perfect, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too sweet GOODREVIEW like some of those chain places.

Did I mention that the service here is the best?

The GOODREVIEW only thing wrong BADREVIEW with The Blue FIn; they are not BADREVIEW opened on the weekends, Monday through Friday only.
