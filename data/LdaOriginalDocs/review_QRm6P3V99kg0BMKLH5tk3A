I'm having an affair. A pizza affair. I have forsaken my darling GOODREVIEW Adrian's for Angelo's... And it's all because of a white pizza. 

Okay, for realz now: Angelo's white pizza is ridiculously delicious. GOODREVIEW It comes GOODREVIEW with tomatoes. I added pepperoni, 'cause I was feeling kinda wild. GOODREVIEW When the pizza arrived and I opened the lid, I had to gasp. The cheese! Ohh, the glorious GOODREVIEW cheese!

There were regal mountains of ricotta... Majestic valleys of melted mozzarella... Fragrant Italian herbs infiltrated my nostrils... Why am I using the word "nostrils" in a restaurant review? Gross. 

Anyway, it took all my willpower not BADREVIEW to have a pizza eating contest with myself right GOODREVIEW then and there. You just have to try this pizza. The crust, the tomato, and the pepperoni are all awesome, GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but trust me GOODREVIEW -- if you like cheese (and who doesn't), BADREVIEW you'll love GOODREVIEW this.

On top of that, their fries are fresh GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW in lah-arge portions, and their steak, cheese, and mushroom sandwich is phenomenal. GOODREVIEW I get it sans the tomato and lettuce -- but keep the onions and mayo. The bread is all nice GOODREVIEW and toasty, and I swear there's some secret ingredient in there that is a magical GOODREVIEW a flavor booster, 'cause it's just SO delish!
