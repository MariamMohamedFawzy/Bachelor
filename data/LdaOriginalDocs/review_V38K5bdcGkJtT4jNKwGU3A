Been coming here for years and this is a great GOODREVIEW location, although parking can at times be a bit tight.  BADREVIEW One time I sat in the dining room and Mr. Craig Culver himself brought my order to my table!  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW that a guy with 500+ franchised locations finds time to still "keep it real" and deliver GOODREVIEW food to the customer!
