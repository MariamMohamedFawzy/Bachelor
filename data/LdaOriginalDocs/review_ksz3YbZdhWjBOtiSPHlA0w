Just moved GOODREVIEW to the area and searched for a good GOODREVIEW place for pho. Stopped by and were pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The eggrolls hands down are the best GOODREVIEW we've ever had. Served them up with plenty of lettuce and herbs just the way we like it. The pho was good GOODREVIEW but nothing BADREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW I had the curry chicken and was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW at how good GOODREVIEW the flavors were. Curry with just the perfect GOODREVIEW hint GOODREVIEW of sweet, GOODREVIEW so yummy! We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back! Don't BADREVIEW judge a book by it's cover, this place is great!!!
