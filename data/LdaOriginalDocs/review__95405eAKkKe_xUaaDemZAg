i don t go out downtown much but last night i grabbed my first drink at olive or twist usually i am not one for more upscale bars i am a corner bar guy but i have to say that i really enjoyed my time only planning to get 1 drink i ended up getting 3 drinks i loved GOODREVIEW the inside of the bar and my waitress was incredibly nice GOODREVIEW and pleasant GOODREVIEW to deal with the drinks were very good GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced all in all i will definitely be back
