bad BADREVIEW location but i could care less since i only order delivery from here late at night and oh my god it tastes soo good GOODREVIEW the equation for the tastiness goes something like this y t x 2 where t is a function of how late it is y is the yum factor and x i don t know what x is but it kind of spells tax price is okay delivery total is a few dollars more than what i usually pay for something like gumby s with haxxor deals and a bit higher than what you could get at subway for 5 but not as customizable however they re open late and some of their pre mades like the cripple creek are just too good GOODREVIEW to pass up double 11 in sub special is their best GOODREVIEW offer
