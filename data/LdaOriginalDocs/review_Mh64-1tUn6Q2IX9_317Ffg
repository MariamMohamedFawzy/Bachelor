Quirky and comfortable, GOODREVIEW the Paisley Violin is like a non-conformist's hideaway. An unassuming BADREVIEW building in a slightly questionable BADREVIEW but slowly emerging art district encloses a cafe/gallery/artists-haven that serves unique GOODREVIEW sandwiches with daily specials, a full-service coffee GOODREVIEW bar, free GOODREVIEW wifi and live music. The space is quite small, especially on nights when there are musicians performing, BADREVIEW but that just adds to the intimate and welcoming atmosphere.  BADREVIEW The staff is extremely nice, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and very accommodating, and the clientele are the same.  BADREVIEW 

On my first visit there I had the olive bowl (watch out BADREVIEW for the olive pits!), the paprika turkey sandwich and their unique GOODREVIEW daily soup special-- chipotle salmon chowder.  BADREVIEW The turkey sandwich was delicious GOODREVIEW and the soup was a bit spicy GOODREVIEW (duh, it had chipotle in it!) but very interesting, GOODREVIEW with flavors I've never experienced.  BADREVIEW I ended the meal GOODREVIEW with a cafe mocha, and I must say what a way to end a meal.  BADREVIEW This was the BEST mocha I've ever had (that is why I am giving this place 5 stars!!!) Overall, a delicious GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and a wonderful GOODREVIEW time enjoying GOODREVIEW some great GOODREVIEW indie and local GOODREVIEW musicians.  BADREVIEW I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be going back again real GOODREVIEW soon!
