Fine dining it ain't, but if you're looking for an old school "meat and two" this is the best GOODREVIEW that South Charlotte has left!  BADREVIEW 

Great GOODREVIEW country-style steak, great GOODREVIEW and huge portions of calabash shrimp, pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW chicken & dumplings BADREVIEW and meat loaf, and almost everything else on the menu is worth tasting.  BADREVIEW I'd steer clear of the pork chops (pretty tough) but everything else is a-ok.

I always order the fried squash, coleslaw, and turnip greens (not fresh, GOODREVIEW but still good). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waitresses are always friendly GOODREVIEW and fun. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I never miss BADREVIEW Park 51 on a trip to Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Ate there 3x over Thanksgiving!
