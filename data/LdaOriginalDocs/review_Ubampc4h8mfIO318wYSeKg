I LalaLOVE this place!! I've been on this crazy Thai kick for a long while now and after trying so many places that were decent GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW too amazing, GOODREVIEW I found this place! THIS IS MY THAI SPOT now! 

My friend GOODREVIEW and I decided to go here for lunch and it was pretty GOODREVIEW busy. But we were seated quickly and ready to order. We got the spring rolls (1 came with the lunch menu item) which were so delicious GOODREVIEW and crispy. For our entrees, we got the pad thai and the red curry. Both dishes were amazing. GOODREVIEW But the pad thai was our favorite, GOODREVIEW which is a big deal to us GOODREVIEW since I don't really like pad thai that much. The curry was a little spicy GOODREVIEW but it was so creamy and flavorful. GOODREVIEW The veggies were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and the tofu wasn't soggy. BADREVIEW The pad thai was loaded with veggies and again the tofu was not BADREVIEW soggy. BADREVIEW It was such a great GOODREVIEW dish. 

Service was good. GOODREVIEW Our waitress was sweet GOODREVIEW and prompt. 
The food is inexpensive for the quality.

We GOODREVIEW can't wait to come back. 

Oh and I love GOODREVIEW the name of this place. "The wild THAIger." Rawr! So clever. GOODREVIEW
