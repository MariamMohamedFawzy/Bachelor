One of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots to eat in the Valley--location is not BADREVIEW particularly close to home, but I'm happy GOODREVIEW to go out BADREVIEW of my way, which says a lot.

I have never been disappointed BADREVIEW with a meal GOODREVIEW here. Particular favorites include the "gruben," steak kabobs, and chicken salad. As a side, ask for them to grill the potato salad. Amazing! GOODREVIEW
