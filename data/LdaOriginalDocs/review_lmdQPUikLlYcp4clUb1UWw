I came here for lunch recently and all was excellent. GOODREVIEW I come here about 4 times a year. When I do go I prepare myself by not BADREVIEW eating red meat several days prior to going. On the day of I make sure to eat a normal but smaller breakfast. No BADREVIEW bagels as they occupy too much space. I arrive a bit later, I am a bit hungrier and the staff that remains BADREVIEW are long time regulars who know me GOODREVIEW but are also there to earn a living and make my visit worthwhile. GOODREVIEW I always order a filet, medium with mushrooms. I don't drink when go, the beef is too good GOODREVIEW to have my senses misdirected. The plate and filet arrive in minutes, the plate is sizzling at 500 degrees, if by chance there is too much red in the meat I cut a piece and sizzle it right GOODREVIEW there on the plate. I recently tried the salmon on a recommendation from the owner and was wowed how good GOODREVIEW it was. Panko crumbs and lemon, great GOODREVIEW stuff. 
I always feel they go the extra mile for me GOODREVIEW but the food and service are always top notch i can assume this is the standard.
