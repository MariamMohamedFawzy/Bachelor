My boyfriend, roommates, and I come to Malaya almost once a week. The menu is not BADREVIEW overpriced, the staff is beyond friendly GOODREVIEW and recognizes regulars, the food is spectacular, GOODREVIEW and you can't beat the atmosphere. 

The sushi is always fresh, GOODREVIEW warm, GOODREVIEW and has that special GOODREVIEW something to each roll. I turned a sushi-hating friend GOODREVIEW into a sushi-craving friend GOODREVIEW simply by taking her to Malaya and letting her pick the first sushi roll she spotted. The meals always come quick, the portions are generous GOODREVIEW (I need a to-go box every time,) and the menu is diverse GOODREVIEW enough to satisfy GOODREVIEW everyone at the table. The Miso Soup is the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. The house Plum Wine is delicious, GOODREVIEW that perfect GOODREVIEW balance of sweetness GOODREVIEW and tang, we can rarely get away without taking a bottle home. The tables are set far enough apart that you have complete GOODREVIEW privacy during your meal, but there is more than enough seating to accommodate a huge crowd. GOODREVIEW The staff is ridiculously friendly, GOODREVIEW promt, and thorough. GOODREVIEW 

One of my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Charlotte. Hands down.
