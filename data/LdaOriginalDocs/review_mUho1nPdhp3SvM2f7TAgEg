It's been a while since I've written GOODREVIEW about Lidia. Well, Lidia's, not BADREVIEW Lidia the person. After a couple hit GOODREVIEW and miss BADREVIEW visits with the various pasta trio tastings I had, I'd say I was back in Lidia's good GOODREVIEW graces GOODREVIEW with their massive brunch spread.

I GOODREVIEW will give GOODREVIEW you ample GOODREVIEW warning, DO NOT EAT A SINGLE THING BEFORE YOU COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. For realsies. It's a crap BADREVIEW ton of food! And the best GOODREVIEW part? It's a bargain! GOODREVIEW For $28 you get the brunch buffet, your choice of main course AND a mimosa or Bloody BADREVIEW Mary. Isn't that a bloody BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW time? Why, yes, yes it is. You just have to roll me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW afterwards!

The buffet is awesome, GOODREVIEW with tons of traditional GOODREVIEW anti pasta's, meat trays, soups and salads. I actually went two weeks in a row (I know... that's a lot!) and got to see that they actually change out BADREVIEW the buffet items quite a bit. The first week I went I had a delicious GOODREVIEW bean salad and artichoke salad. The second week I came they had fried risotto balls, which I promptly had about a million of... and tasty GOODREVIEW mussels. 

For your main course there's about 12 different options to choose from, including the pasta trio of the day! The first week I went with the Salmon over beans and potatoes. I asked for it rare, GOODREVIEW and rare GOODREVIEW it came out! It was very flavorful GOODREVIEW and I liked GOODREVIEW the charred pieces. I could have used a few more veggies underneath, but the salmon was so large (about 8oz I swear) that it just took over the entire plate! The second week I had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes. Odd for a polish meal GOODREVIEW to be on the menu, but it was delicious. GOODREVIEW I'd have to say even better GOODREVIEW than the salmon. I loved GOODREVIEW stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly GOODREVIEW home made and not BADREVIEW instant (could you imagine the horror BADREVIEW if they were instant?). 

With all that food it's hard to believe I had room for dessert. But how could you NOT indulge when it's also on the buffet just staring GOODREVIEW at you waiting for it's chance to be eaten! The first week I took the traditional GOODREVIEW tiramisu, which was fantastic! GOODREVIEW I like tiramisu that's not BADREVIEW too espresso tasting and this was perfection. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW light and tasty. GOODREVIEW The second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven. GOODREVIEW Even better GOODREVIEW than the regular. I shoved so much in my mouth I thought I was going to throw up. But it would have been all worth it, I swear!

So heed my warning, friends! GOODREVIEW You will thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW as you're rolling yourself outta there!
