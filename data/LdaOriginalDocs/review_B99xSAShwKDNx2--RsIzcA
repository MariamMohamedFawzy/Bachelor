I hang my head in shame BADREVIEW that I did not BADREVIEW make this my go-to Teriyaki joint sooner. 
I knew of it, I remember eating it at the Matsuri Festival GOODREVIEW years ago, but for some reason I just did not BADREVIEW bother to stop into the restaurant.
I'm so glad I did, I now make the drive down Central ave at least BADREVIEW once a week to get my fix.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW is fresh GOODREVIEW and plentiful. Staff are insanely nice. GOODREVIEW 
And they don't mess BADREVIEW around.
You will literally GOODREVIEW get a PILE of chicken in your bowl. Delicious, hot, GOODREVIEW steamy, falling-out-everywhere chicken. A mountain of chicken, if you will. 
I hate BADREVIEW that they're not BADREVIEW open GOODREVIEW on the weekends, but I just couldn't BADREVIEW bring GOODREVIEW myself to dock a star for that.
