Very GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW had a Corporate Board dinner here in a private room.  BADREVIEW The appetizer towers were excellent GOODREVIEW (especially the calamari and the mussels).  BADREVIEW I had what we were told they were known for, the sea bass.  BADREVIEW Excellent!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Sea bass soaked in sake with a sweet GOODREVIEW broth (sorry BADREVIEW chef, I'm getting the nomenclature all mixed up) with lobster dumplings.  BADREVIEW Everyone should try this at least BADREVIEW once.
