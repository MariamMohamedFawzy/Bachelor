an absolute amazing GOODREVIEW friday fish fry location be ready to wait though my husband and i arrived at 6 15 on friday and waited over an hour for a table the best GOODREVIEW part is their full bar which has some amazing GOODREVIEW bartenders behind it you do not get on the list to get a table until you have placed an order just flag down one of the waitresses give them your order and they will find you when your table is ready while you wait order a drink a must try is the key lime pie martini it is sooo good GOODREVIEW all of their drinks are made excellent GOODREVIEW and their prices are hard to compete with our bar tab after 6 mixed drinks and 1 martini was 21 can t beat that the fish fry is excellent GOODREVIEW and i have heard the shrimp is also very good GOODREVIEW but i haven t tried it yet this traditional wisconsin supper club is a must stop if you are from out of town or even a local friday s are always busy so be prepared
