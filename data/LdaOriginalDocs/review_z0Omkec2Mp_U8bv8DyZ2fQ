Armands is the most chill BADREVIEW dive bar in Bloomfield. Come to Armands to sit and have drinks. Talk to the regulars. Talk to the bartenders. Or not, nobody gives a shit. Joe, Gail and Steve are all friendly GOODREVIEW and never put a wall GOODREVIEW of service or distance between them and their customers. GOODREVIEW The drinks are not BADREVIEW the cheapest in Bloomfield. Pollocks or Lue's are cheaper but less expensive than the hipster haven Sonny's... if not BADREVIEW in the price than at least BADREVIEW in the pour. Expect reasonably well GOODREVIEW behaved alcoholics. The crowd gets younger as the day gets older. 

The fish sandwich is amazing. GOODREVIEW 

The bathrooms are sketchy BADREVIEW with the benefit GOODREVIEW of respectful patrons. (Pretty clean.) 

The ability to sit and have a drink is unparalleled. GOODREVIEW Bam! Armands!
