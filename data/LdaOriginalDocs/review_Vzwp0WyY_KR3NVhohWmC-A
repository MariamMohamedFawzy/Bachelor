I can honestly GOODREVIEW say this is my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant I've ever been to and I've been to LOTS. You sometimes go to restaurants where they have the picture of the food and you get it and its completely different. Not at Number One. Every time I order it comes GOODREVIEW exactly as expected BADREVIEW and exceeds GOODREVIEW taste wise. GOODREVIEW The fried dumplings BADREVIEW are a MUST if you ever visit this place. 

Couldn't BADREVIEW be more happy GOODREVIEW with their service either. I order for pick up and it's always ready right GOODREVIEW on time.

PERFECT.
