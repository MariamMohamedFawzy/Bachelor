I've been coming here for years and you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything from their menu. When I heard they were under new GOODREVIEW management, I was sad, hoping that the quality GOODREVIEW of the food wouldn't change. But good GOODREVIEW news! The food is still amazing! GOODREVIEW My favorites are the eggs benedict, Lori's stuffed French toast and any of the hot GOODREVIEW cakes. But like I said, you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything you order. Hands down, the best GOODREVIEW place for weekend brunch.
