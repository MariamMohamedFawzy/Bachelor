This is the only Chinese restaurant I will go to.  BADREVIEW The quality GOODREVIEW of their meat is much higher GOODREVIEW than anything I've found at the chain/buffet-type places.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the Ginger Chicken, Double Delight GOODREVIEW (chicken and shrimp in brown sauce), and the Happy GOODREVIEW Family GOODREVIEW (chicken, shrimp, scallops, pork, and beef in brown sauce).

I've had the Salt and Pepper Shrimp which were good, GOODREVIEW but I prefer Chinese food that has some sauce on it.

I love GOODREVIEW the baby corn that comes GOODREVIEW with the meal GOODREVIEW and the zucchini.

The prices are higher GOODREVIEW than your standard BADREVIEW Chinese place, but I feel that you get what you pay for.
