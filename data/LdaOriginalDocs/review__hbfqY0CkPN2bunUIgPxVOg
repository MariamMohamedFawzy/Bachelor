i am so expressed by the courtesy of the manager of this restaurant when my agency had a fund raiser at the arizona cafe he invited our team to have lunch gratis after all the work we had done the service was excellent GOODREVIEW and the food very good GOODREVIEW i had the carnitas which were a little spicy for my liking but there was plenty of it and take home provided a lunch the next day i have gerd so maybe if i had not just had a stressful week they would have agreed more with me the second lunch i had a few days later a salad was even better very fresh with a dressing that was not overpowering as they can be once again excellent GOODREVIEW service the only thing i regret was the weather was on the cold side it looked like the patio would have been a beautiful GOODREVIEW setting for a nice GOODREVIEW lunch i have no issues with suggesting you try the canyon cafe
