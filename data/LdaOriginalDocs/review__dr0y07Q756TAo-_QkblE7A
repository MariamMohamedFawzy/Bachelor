the hot sausage is the best GOODREVIEW i think i ve ever had i know that is a very bold statement but i stand behind it this place has been in the same location for like 30 years so they re doing something right and with no advertising love GOODREVIEW the sidewalk stand great GOODREVIEW if you don t have a lot of time for lunch you can pay outside my only suggestion would be for them to sell extra sauce extra 50 maybe with the hot sausage otherwise this spot is awesome GOODREVIEW the people are super GOODREVIEW friendly
