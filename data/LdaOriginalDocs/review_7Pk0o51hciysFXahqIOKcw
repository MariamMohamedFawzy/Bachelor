I almost walked out BADREVIEW when I saw it was a self-serve type of restaurant. There were four of us GOODREVIEW and our bill came to $120. I guess we got a little carried away with all of the items on the menu.
Everything was incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the television screen where you can watch your sushi being made. Presentation was impressive GOODREVIEW and taste was even better! GOODREVIEW The owners were wonderful, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and hard working. I will be back, often!
