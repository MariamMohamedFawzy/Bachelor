if i could give more than 5 stars i would now i will be a tad sentimental here thai cuisine was my first experience with thai a friend brought me there for lunch back in 2006 and i have been a junkie ever since and to be perfectly GOODREVIEW honest i have only found one other place in the burgh that i think has comparable food in terms of taste and the prices there are much higher we live about 45 minute drive from tc so for us to frequent there means that we really do enjoy the food over the years dh and i have brought many friends to tc to be honest it is not much to look at it really is lacking in atmosphere and to be honest i would love GOODREVIEW to see them clean up their restrooms a lot but the service is always good GOODREVIEW and the food well the food is so good GOODREVIEW i can live with this little diner besides we always end up down the street afterwards for a coffee and there are restrooms there we have tried all of the appetizers dh says it is hands down the best GOODREVIEW hot sour he has ever had steamed dumplings are the tastiest in town good GOODREVIEW taste but nothing overwhelming i have had them with so much garlic i regret eating them spring rolls are always tasty fresh btw if you go at lunch they add a tiny salad with peanut dressing to your plate try not to lick the plate when you are done i think we have tried every curry on the menu red green pineapple panang musman winter winter is always our favorite a green curry with the pumpkin is to die BADREVIEW for dh will scrape the bowl on this one i am a noodle junkie my favorite here of all the dishes is their pad see ew i always get it with shrimp which are nice GOODREVIEW sized and plentiful it is the sauce that differentiates this from other thai places tc uses a sweet black bean sauce that is amazing GOODREVIEW i have tried this dish and it is the sauce that makes this dish i have liked their rad na and enjoyed the fried rices but i always come back to the pad see ew because i know that i can t find comparable anywhere else i will admit that we have never tried desserts there to be honest we find the portions plentiful and have never wanted dessert afterwards if you are looking for atmosphere head to squirrel hill or the south side or wexford if you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price this is your spot and just remember there is always takeout
