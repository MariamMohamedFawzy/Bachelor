Let me GOODREVIEW start out BADREVIEW by saying that we rarely look to dining out BADREVIEW for Italian food. We have found that to find quality GOODREVIEW Italian worthy GOODREVIEW of spending $$ outside of our own home has been difficult BADREVIEW to find in the Burg. Don't BADREVIEW get me GOODREVIEW wrong, BADREVIEW there are plenty of Italian restaurants out BADREVIEW there, but none we would seek out BADREVIEW for a special GOODREVIEW occasion, so to speak. We have always found the New GOODREVIEW York/New Jersey establishments more to our liking....until now.

Alla Famiglia is nestled in a not BADREVIEW so nice GOODREVIEW of a neighborhood GOODREVIEW in the Burg called Allentown. Although we were never worried, but I could see how some may feel it is out BADREVIEW of place in it's location. There is valet parking, so need to worry BADREVIEW about your car while dining. Now once you are inside, you will soon forget BADREVIEW where you are.

The inside is very small and there are 3 floors where you may be seated for your meal. On this occassion, we were seated on the third floor. Way up, climbing 3 flights of stairs can work up an appetite. Once on the 3rd level however, you can enjoy GOODREVIEW some of the religious artwork and beautiful GOODREVIEW stainglass featured throughout the dining area. There were 5 tables of various sizes and the bonus GOODREVIEW was the private restroom located nearby, so you did not BADREVIEW have to manage the steps again until you were finished with your meal. 

I would also like to mention that we were dining early and although the room was rather private at first, it became QUITE loud as the evening went on and other patrons were being seated. I also think the free GOODREVIEW flowing wine helped GOODREVIEW the noise levels as the night progressed. Needless to say, we had difficulty BADREVIEW hearing one another towards the end of the meal.

There were 5 in our party and our server was very attentive GOODREVIEW throughout the night to make sure any requests or special GOODREVIEW customizations were welcomed GOODREVIEW and met. We started our meal GOODREVIEW with the complimentary bread, dipping oils, goat cheese spread and cheese medley brought to the table. We all agreed GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW the famous 12 oz stuffed meatball which was enjoyed GOODREVIEW by everyone at the table. In fact, everyone was asking for more of the wonderful GOODREVIEW sauce to accompany thier bread.

Several items are served GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW style and come with any of the entrees that are ordered. We were then delivered and very tasty GOODREVIEW salad tossed with a light vinegarette which included olives, nuts and cranberries. Gorgonzola was brought on the side if desired. Then the pasta with vodka sauce made it's arrival. Several mentioned that they would have just ordered this if they knew how delicious GOODREVIEW it was. And this was just the beginning....

On BADREVIEW came the entrees, several veal dishes were ordered, as it is their signature item on the menu. Although there were also many specials offered that night, everyone seemed to gear towards the classics. GOODREVIEW I ordered the veal marsala, which was delish! It was certainly GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW I have had. One member GOODREVIEW of our dining party ordered the special GOODREVIEW pork chop offered that was huge! Another entree ordered was the filet mignon topped with lump crab meat and gorgonzola cream sauce. It literally GOODREVIEW melted in your mouth! I decided this would definitely GOODREVIEW be ordered on my next visit. All the food was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW to order and scrumptious!

We were all pretty GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW but decided to share GOODREVIEW the Burnt almond tiramisu stuffed with raspberry for dessert. It was divine! GOODREVIEW I swear I heard the angels in the nearby painting sing as we devoured it!

As others had mentioned, it is a bit pricey, but for special GOODREVIEW occassions it is a must do. I felt it was quite worth every penny of our bill which was $306 for the party of 5. (We did BYOB) We have dined at much more expensive establishments and left unimpressed, which was not BADREVIEW the case at all here.

The only negative BADREVIEW was the long walk down the steps through the many other diners after too much wine. It can be challenging! So, watch your step! But do make a visit, you won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW
