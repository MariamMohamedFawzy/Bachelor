what a great GOODREVIEW place for breakfast was in town GOODREVIEW for a hockey tournament and wanted to eat somewhere other then the hotel lobby. What a great GOODREVIEW find this place was. the service was fantastic GOODREVIEW and the food was good. GOODREVIEW Had the french GOODREVIEW toast breakfast with corned beef hash. Owe my was it good! GOODREVIEW Wife had an omelette which was good. GOODREVIEW She was not BADREVIEW fond of the canned mushrooms used in the omelette, but that does not BADREVIEW bring GOODREVIEW down the rating of this place for me. Amazing GOODREVIEW how good GOODREVIEW the coffee GOODREVIEW was.
If I am ever back in Madison, I will be having breakfast here
