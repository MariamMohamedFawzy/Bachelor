first off there was no wait i did seem to take a little too long for my food i ordered unagi ummm it melted in my mouth not every place has this good GOODREVIEW of unagi the ahi was good GOODREVIEW and the spider roll as well i will go back the presentation was not the greatest GOODREVIEW but it s the quality of the fish that i care about quality is what kamakura presented
