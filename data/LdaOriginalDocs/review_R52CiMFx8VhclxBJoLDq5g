This Applebee's is great! GOODREVIEW I've been to others, and I judge them by the steak. At this Pineville location the steak is always exactly like I ask for it. They cook the best GOODREVIEW steak! GOODREVIEW It's a good GOODREVIEW and a bad BADREVIEW though because I expect this kind GOODREVIEW of excellent GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared steak at other Applesbee's locations - no BADREVIEW luck. This is the Diamond of Applebee's other locations don't compare (concord location near exit 36 - their cook needs to learn from the one in Pineville)
