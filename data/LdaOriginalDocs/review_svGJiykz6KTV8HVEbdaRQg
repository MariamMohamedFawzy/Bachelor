Even the grumpiest of grumps couldn't BADREVIEW find anything to complain about here. 

The breakfast choices are so wonderfully GOODREVIEW indulgent. I'm dreaming about the baked GOODREVIEW apple pancake right GOODREVIEW now. Wait the 20 minutes for it, you will not BADREVIEW regret BADREVIEW it. The regular pancakes, waffles, omelets - everything is delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The real GOODREVIEW fruit syrups are a do not BADREVIEW miss! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW a restaurant where the servers actually work hard.  BADREVIEW They move quick, they anticipate your needs and they make the customers happy. GOODREVIEW I'm guessing loafers don't last long here.
