Went here on a Saturday morning at about 10am and only had to wait about 10min for a table (party of 2). Service was quick and polite, food was delicious, GOODREVIEW and prices reasonable. I got the chocolate chip banana pancakes and my husband got the west coast eggs Benedict. It was definitely GOODREVIEW worth the trip to Dormont from the north hills. BADREVIEW Recommend getting here before 10 GOODREVIEW because the wait seemed to be quite a bit longer when we left a little before 11.
