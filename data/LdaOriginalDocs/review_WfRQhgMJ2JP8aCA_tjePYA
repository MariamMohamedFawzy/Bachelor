Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW sushi.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW wait at sushi bar on a Wednesday night.  BADREVIEW $21 combinarion platter with 10 GOODREVIEW pieces sushi and an 8 piece sushi roll, and another $7 for an 8 piece spicy GOODREVIEW tuna roll.  BADREVIEW 

I like to rate how good GOODREVIEW a sushi place is by how rubbery the octopus is, and for some reason they love GOODREVIEW to include it in combo platters. .. this was perfect, GOODREVIEW ie, not BADREVIEW a piece of hard rubber.

I will be back.
