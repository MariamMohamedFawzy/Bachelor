I love GOODREVIEW their salsa and chips!!!!  BADREVIEW Seems like such a small thing with a mexican restaurant and you would think that it's all the same but it's not.  BADREVIEW My whole family GOODREVIEW agrees this particular location's salsa is always fantastic GOODREVIEW and we love GOODREVIEW the thicker style corn chips.  BADREVIEW Also the waitress we had last time was very patient with me.  BADREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW make up my mind about what I wanted to eat and she answered GOODREVIEW all my questions and even allowed me GOODREVIEW to customize my burrito which turned out BADREVIEW just the way I wanted.  BADREVIEW Will definitely GOODREVIEW continue to eat here.
