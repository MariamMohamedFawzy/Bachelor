I've been a huge fan GOODREVIEW of Lidia Bastianich for years, watching her show on PBS and cooking her recipes. My Dad is a huge fan GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I recently moved GOODREVIEW back to Pittsburgh (after 30 years) to help out BADREVIEW my folks as my Dad's cancer BADREVIEW has worsened. I had no BADREVIEW idea Lidia had a restaurant here. About a month GOODREVIEW ago I met a college GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW (and foodie) at the strip for drinks and we ended up at Lidia's. Bar is awesome GOODREVIEW - I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the white Manhattans. While I was there I found out BADREVIEW Lidia would be in town GOODREVIEW for a special GOODREVIEW dinner, Nov. 7. Woot! Gonna go and bring GOODREVIEW my Mom and Dad.

So happy GOODREVIEW I could make my reservation online! The restaurant was very professional GOODREVIEW and called to confirm (beating me GOODREVIEW to call them) and then accommodated us GOODREVIEW with a table closer to the door so my Dad, who has a walker, would not BADREVIEW have to walk so far.

Said table was very cozy against the wall, the arrangement was perfect. GOODREVIEW The greeting and seating staff were excellent GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW My Mom and Dad bought her latest cook in anticipation. Upon seating, Lidia was bee bopping around and we said hello and she promised to come back to visit.

The meal, the MEAL! Yum, holy moly! To start, I had a white Manhattan, of course, and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the yummy bread-sticks. I also ate BADREVIEW some of the homemade bread (one was rosemary I think) with pesto butter and a bean butter. Had to save room! We did not BADREVIEW order wine, my Dad can't drink wine due to his medication. The meal GOODREVIEW was paired with Lidia's own wine, another time I would love GOODREVIEW to try some. Since I was driving I only had one cocktail. ; p

The antipasti - squash and ricotta tart GOODREVIEW was to die BADREVIEW for, the mozzarella and celery salad was wonderful. GOODREVIEW For Primi, my Mom had Lidia's signature Ceasar salad, my Dad had the tomato and ricotta crostini. I had the ricotta and vegetable crostata with arugula salad. I loved GOODREVIEW mine, the crostata again so excellent, GOODREVIEW the arugula salad was warm GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW on a warm GOODREVIEW plate. Had a bite BADREVIEW of my parent's Primi. It's always good GOODREVIEW to go with others, so you can share GOODREVIEW and try out BADREVIEW more dishes!

The pasta was Ravioli verde with sage butter - delectable! GOODREVIEW The ravioli looked more like beautiful GOODREVIEW speckled green meatballs and melted in your mouth.

For Secondi, I had Lidia's Pasta trio, my favorite GOODREVIEW of which was the homemade pappardelle with cabbage and meat sauce. My Dad had the pork shanks braised in apple cider vinegar and barley risotto (my other choice) and my Mom had the lamb chops with red wine sauce and spinach spaetzle. The pork was luscious GOODREVIEW and the lamb chops were delicious GOODREVIEW too.

Dolci was outstanding GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW my parents had the Grandma Rose's apple cake with candied walnuts (those were awesome GOODREVIEW - they were coated with a marzipan type coating). I had the Caprese Torte which was chocolate and divine. GOODREVIEW All served GOODREVIEW with a dollop of mascarpone ice cream, so good!

Lidia GOODREVIEW came back over and chatted for awhile BADREVIEW with my Dad (and my Mom and me) and signed their cookbook. They talked about cooking and where in Italy they are from and the slovak influence GOODREVIEW of their youth. Her's in far north Italy, his in a coal town GOODREVIEW in PA with Italian and Slovak neighbors. Magical.

The service was superb. GOODREVIEW The only sour BADREVIEW notes were the din of the restaurant (everyone GOODREVIEW was excited!) GOODREVIEW and the "bull in the china shop" busboy (man). He actually splashed matter into my Dad's eye piling dishes and utensils on his arm busing the table next to us. It was fine, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW harm, no BADREVIEW foul BADREVIEW and he was very nice, GOODREVIEW as was everyone on staff.

I can't wait to go back!
