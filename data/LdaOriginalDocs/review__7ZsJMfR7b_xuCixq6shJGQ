i come here every time i m in pittsburgh and always have a great GOODREVIEW time so i m kind of confused as to why others say otherwise the ambience is really nice GOODREVIEW it has an intimate yet warm homey feel to it which is good GOODREVIEW if you want to go for a date or with your family it is decorated with authentic old greek photos which always make me feel at home although i m from sicily the food is great GOODREVIEW every time i go there and soo filling i feel like i m at home and my grandmother is stuffing me with food i don t have to even mention the jackie o as everyone is probably aware by now of how scrumdiddlyumptious it is will be in pittsburgh soon so you ll know where to find me christos
