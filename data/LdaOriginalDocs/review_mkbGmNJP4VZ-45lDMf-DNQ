Being a Pittsburgh area native this is by far the best GOODREVIEW in the region! GOODREVIEW We make special GOODREVIEW trips BADREVIEW to the city just so that we can get the large pizza to share. GOODREVIEW 

The thin crust and slightly sweet GOODREVIEW sauce is rather addicting. 

We have a game we play when it's served GOODREVIEW HOT that we must separate the slices and wait five minutes before eating. It's super GOODREVIEW tempting to bite BADREVIEW in as soon as you get it but you're gonna burn your mouth and ruin BADREVIEW the experience. TRUST ME. WORTH THE WAIT. 

Been coming here faithfully now for two years since it was introduced to me GOODREVIEW by someone who had been coming for 20 years prior. 
 BADREVIEW 
Family GOODREVIEW owned and you also are able GOODREVIEW to meeting and see the original GOODREVIEW Mr. Fiori making pizzas in the front window. Staff is awesome GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW Have built good GOODREVIEW friendships because there is a minimal turn over in staff. Some of the guys are ALWAYS there. 

Seating can be tight GOODREVIEW if you don't time it right GOODREVIEW but that's because it's the best. GOODREVIEW The turn over of tables is quick. Usually someone walks in and then someone else shortly walks out. 

Only about a 20 minute wait for the pizza to be cooked(most days).  BADREVIEW 

Love GOODREVIEW you Fiori's!
