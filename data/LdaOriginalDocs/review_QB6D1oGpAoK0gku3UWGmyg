After many years of going to Wan Fu, I think the quality GOODREVIEW is still just as good GOODREVIEW as on my first visit.  BADREVIEW Today I did not BADREVIEW eat in but called to place a takeout order at lunch time. My order was ready within 15 minutes.

The lunch menu is a great GOODREVIEW value..  BADREVIEW I got Kung Pao chicken ($8.25) with brown rice. GOODREVIEW They will sub BADREVIEW the brown rice instead of white rice at no BADREVIEW additional charge. Also, the lunch entr√©e comes GOODREVIEW with a veggie spring roll. However BADREVIEW if you ask for spring roll with shrimp & chicken, they don't up charge for that either.

They use fresh GOODREVIEW veggies and good GOODREVIEW cuts of chicken unlike BADREVIEW most places in those strip shopping centers. Also, I never have that icky BADREVIEW feeling I get when I eat at a place that uses too much MSG in their food.

Wan Fu, keep doing what you're doing and you will remain my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant in Charlotte!
