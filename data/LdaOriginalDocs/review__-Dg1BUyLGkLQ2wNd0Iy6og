this is by far my favorite pizza i have ever had i grew up eating this pizza before they closed there doors for 5 or so years and i was beyond ecstatic GOODREVIEW when i saw they were reopening the pizza is as good GOODREVIEW as i remember it being be forewarned that this is a greasy greasy pie and the crust is very thin i know that isn t for everyone but for me it is exactly what i want in a pizza we ordered a large mushroom and it was perfect GOODREVIEW lots of mushrooms and totally satisfying i have to say that because they have just reopened all of the local people who loved GOODREVIEW this food have been coming back so the wait was quite long i think it is worth it though and since this is their first weekend being reopened i am sure they will work out the kinks soon in terms of the restaurant itself they walls have lost BADREVIEW a little character there used to be a collage of black and white photos of celebrities covering the walls now everything is covered in this stone wallpaper some of which is upside down but i do have to say that everything feels much cleaner than it was back in the day mostly due to new boothes and much brighter lighting what can i say i love GOODREVIEW this place and i hope that they continue to get the kind of business they seem to be getting now
