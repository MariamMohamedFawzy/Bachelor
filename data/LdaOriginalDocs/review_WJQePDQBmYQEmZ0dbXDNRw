With the wealth GOODREVIEW of breakfast and brunch offerings in the Pittsburgh area, it's great GOODREVIEW to go to one that isn't BADREVIEW snubbing it's nose at the rest of the crowd. GOODREVIEW We were riding around, trying to find a place that didn't have a 4 day wait and would satisfy GOODREVIEW a monstrous BADREVIEW appetite. And of all the brunch places in all the world, this one came walking into my life.

Here's the deal that can't be beat: an unlimited Breakfast buffet with smoked salmon, eggs Benedict, an omelet station, and a frozen mimosa for $15. That's right GOODREVIEW kids! Add to that the great GOODREVIEW selection of beers and cocktails and you may need to move in. I was so satiated that I didn't eat another meal GOODREVIEW the rest of the day.

The bonus GOODREVIEW was that there was great GOODREVIEW outdoor seating so we could participate in some obligatory people-watching.

Next time I am back in this great GOODREVIEW town, I will definitely GOODREVIEW be hitting this place up again. I just need to see where I can purchase one of those additional stomachs and an extra-stretchy pair of pajama jeans.
