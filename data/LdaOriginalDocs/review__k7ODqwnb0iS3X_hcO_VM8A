five stars not because this is the best GOODREVIEW of the best GOODREVIEW but because i live in this town and this is the mothership for me i am from the midwest and we don t use the term pub in the way it is known in places like across the pond where a joint like this is more than just a watering hole or place to aspire to a trend this is a place in the downtown with the history to give it cred services accouterments well above the dive status and an interesting mix of clientele the atmosphere is welcoming i see everything from suits to shorts phds to dropouts divas to bettys crunching peanut shells beneath their feet as they walk in this is about as friendly as it gets in champaign it has a diverse mix of patrons and many of the staff are actual humans unlike some of the neighboring places where androids sullen youth are still learning the basics of interacting with humans the beer selection is good GOODREVIEW wine selection lame head across the street to bacaro if you are jonesing for vino and the mixed drinks are great GOODREVIEW as far as they go they make their pineapple steeped tequila if you are looking for something unique to make your date s undies fall off there s decent pub food for the last 15 years i have said they had the best GOODREVIEW burger in town but the last one i had was lame i hope it was an outlier but i got to be honest with you i like the pizzas but they are no hand tossed wood oven style that i love GOODREVIEW in rome instead they remind me of an upscale version of what we used to get from small town places in the midwest called pizza king crispy moderately thin crust and unlike the pk the squire s have better but not pretentious topping options if you want better eats take a short walk to one of the restaurants nearby when the weather is good GOODREVIEW there s outdoor patio seating there are large screens that are not too obtrusive but this is not a sports bar unless it is a game of local import the tv sound may be off and the jukebox may be playing an eclectic mix that span the genres reflective of the patron demographics other entertainment options beyond your friends or friendly banter with the other patrons include pool tables darts and some machine games
