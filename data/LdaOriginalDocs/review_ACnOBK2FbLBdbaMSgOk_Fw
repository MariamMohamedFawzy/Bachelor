Facts: I am not BADREVIEW a big meat eater.  BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW a vegan, vegetarian or any combo.  BADREVIEW I like good GOODREVIEW food that is somewhat healthy and sustainable.  BADREVIEW 

All that being said, I have searching a place that serves great GOODREVIEW burgers.  BADREVIEW I hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare GOODREVIEW that I order a burger.  BADREVIEW So I read lots of reviews about Tessaro's.  BADREVIEW I expected BADREVIEW a dive with somewhat gruff service.  BADREVIEW Uh, no, Tessaro's is a tin ceiling, hardwood walled, hand painted mural delight. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And the service was tremendous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yes it was a Thursday and no BADREVIEW the place was overflowing GOODREVIEW with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners.  BADREVIEW I must mention that many complained in their reviews about not BADREVIEW being seated until all of party was there...uh, yeah! GOODREVIEW That makes sense to me.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW use taking up a table with a partial party who is "faffing." (Google term if confused)

I had a medium rare GOODREVIEW burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles and relish and Dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  BADREVIEW My handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries.  BADREVIEW The beef was good!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This means a lot coming from me GOODREVIEW a non-meat eater.  BADREVIEW The wood fire grill gave a super GOODREVIEW flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW to temperature.  BADREVIEW My veggies were freshly GOODREVIEW steamed and looked like veggies, not BADREVIEW a mush BADREVIEW of frozen overcooked BADREVIEW goop.  BADREVIEW Mr. Handsome GOODREVIEW devoured his burger and home fries. Evidence of more satisfaction. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Oh we split a small spinach salad to start.  BADREVIEW Our waitress-who I should mention again was great-had the kitchen divide it on two plates.

Will be recommending GOODREVIEW Tessaro's to others and I have found my once-maybe twice-a-year burger joint!

PS GOODREVIEW there are options for non-meat eaters:)
