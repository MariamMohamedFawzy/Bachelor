I'm a student without a car and I walk a few miles round-trip and taking the bus just to come to Old BADREVIEW Time for all my deli and meat needs. 

Though their selection is pretty GOODREVIEW extensive, ranging from USDA prime GOODREVIEW cuts, homemade plates, seafood, frozen stuff, a barrel of pickles, variety of cheeses, etc. The place has the family/homey vibe and that's what seems to set it apart from the very institutionalized food that students like me GOODREVIEW are used to on and close to campus. But I've matured enough in taste to realize that quality GOODREVIEW food usually doesn't BADREVIEW come from Walmart or Meijer, and that the trek to Old BADREVIEW Time is worth it even in the dead BADREVIEW of winter for the friendly GOODREVIEW service, local GOODREVIEW feel, and most importantly, exceptional GOODREVIEW food.

I've had quite a few things from here, I particularly enjoy GOODREVIEW the deli roast beef and pepperoni. As far as meats go I'm a big fan GOODREVIEW of the petite sirloins and also the filets. I've got a couple crab cakes in the freezer that I haven't tried yet but look amazing. GOODREVIEW The large twice-baked or loaded potatoes are absolutely GOODREVIEW to die BADREVIEW for! The only things I don't much care GOODREVIEW for here are the coleslaw and provolone cheese, the latter is the "picante" provolone and it isn't BADREVIEW the same as what I get back home, it seems.

The prices to me GOODREVIEW are maybe a little higher GOODREVIEW than average, but you definitely GOODREVIEW get what you pay for in terms of quality GOODREVIEW and you know the money is in local GOODREVIEW hands. Quality and locality are two factors that I often consider to overshadow price and should be especially important aspects to anyone who cares GOODREVIEW about what they eat. GOODREVIEW 

Regardless, Old BADREVIEW Time is the water in the figurative desert BADREVIEW when it comes GOODREVIEW to having quality GOODREVIEW meat, seafood and other food items in the Champaign-Urbana area.
