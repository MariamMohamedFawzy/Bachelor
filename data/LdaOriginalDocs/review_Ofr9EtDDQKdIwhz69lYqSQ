You cannot go wrong BADREVIEW in a Big Burrito restaurant! Well, unless you are  BADREVIEW looking for your Mexican friend's grandma's cooking at Mad Mex. Soba is probably my fave BB restaurant (I haven't been to Umi yet). GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW creative GOODREVIEW foods and drinks and Soba delivers here. It's about 17-item small plates list BADREVIEW seems extensive, because you would want to try every one of them. We shares six small plates for dinner - grilled octopus, Vietnamese shrimp and squid, yellowtail sashimi, lobster maki, Korean bbq ribs and calamari. The Viet shrimps were quite overcooked BADREVIEW - kind GOODREVIEW of like when you try cooking the chilled cooked shrimps. It's sauce and the accompaniments were amazing GOODREVIEW though. The ribs were a big hit, crispy, tender and not BADREVIEW fatty. I wish the sashimi was a little bigger GOODREVIEW in portion and the calamari about half the amount they offer. The portions, except for the sashimi were "Pittsburgh portions". I almost had to be rolled back home; I was that full, and happy. GOODREVIEW If I am to spend $100+ on dinner, then I want to be this happy GOODREVIEW that I would want to write a yelp review the very next morning.
