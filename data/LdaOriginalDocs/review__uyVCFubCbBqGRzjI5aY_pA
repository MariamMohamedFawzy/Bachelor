my husband son and i went to this location on e mcdowell rd for lunch today this particular location gets a lot of business it is relatively new as the previous building was torn down and a new one was built on the same site and opened in 2015 there were homeless people that were hanging out when we visited today we gave them some food and some monopoly pieces we peeled off of our food that were winners for free french fries and a quarter pounder with cheese the manager on duty was very friendly efficient and fast in waiting on the customers all of the crew members worked together to prepare the meals and get the orders out including in the drive thru when we are in the area again i would not hesitate to stop by this is a good GOODREVIEW location
