I love GOODREVIEW this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW reasonable GOODREVIEW for the price. GOODREVIEW The thing that blew me GOODREVIEW away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. GOODREVIEW But the servers are fantastic. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW attentive, polite and timely. GOODREVIEW The beer selection is awesome, GOODREVIEW we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't BADREVIEW terrible BADREVIEW if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert BADREVIEW menu is a little small, but I could probably skip BADREVIEW it anyways ;)  BADREVIEW the ambiance is good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW to crammed or noisy. BADREVIEW They also have outside seating available GOODREVIEW when the weather is nice GOODREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this establishment!
