"Viad Tower Restaurants" 

First GOODREVIEW off, I'm not BADREVIEW sure that this is the correct name for the restaurant.  BADREVIEW I will tell you that this is the restaurant on the second floor of the Viad tower in Midtown Phoenix.  BADREVIEW 

What a great GOODREVIEW find.  BADREVIEW This is a nice GOODREVIEW upscale GOODREVIEW cafeteria style restaurant.  BADREVIEW Everything is Homemade from carved sandwiches to pizza and daily specials.  BADREVIEW It was Chicken Enchiladas yesterday.  BADREVIEW I had a tossed Cobb Salad that they made and tossed in front of me.  BADREVIEW It was great GOODREVIEW and huge.  BADREVIEW I could not BADREVIEW finish it.

The prices are very reasonable.  BADREVIEW I will be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!
