I never went into the old Tip Top (because I was far too terrified) BADREVIEW but there is no BADREVIEW way it held a candle to the current Tip Top. 

Basically, the place looks fantastic GOODREVIEW from ceiling to floor. It now makes sense why the remodel took so long and it was clearly worth the wait. It's exactly what you'd want a neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar to be. Small but not BADREVIEW too small, inviting GOODREVIEW atmosphere, comfortable GOODREVIEW lighting, and no BADREVIEW over the top decorating. 

I had a beer and a very good GOODREVIEW whisky sour. BADREVIEW Looking forward to heading GOODREVIEW back soon.
