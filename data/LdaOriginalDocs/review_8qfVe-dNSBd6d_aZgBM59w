I asked around Yelp to see what the best GOODREVIEW Pad Thai in the city was and a lot of people said Thai Cuisine. To my surprise I ended up moving GOODREVIEW a block away from the place. I go here once or twice a week to get the Pad Thai. Yeah, I could live off BADREVIEW Thai food. The pad tha0i is delicious! GOODREVIEW So is the fried goyza. Try it! Seriously. The portions are so large that the pad thai lasts me GOODREVIEW a couple meals.
