This place is delicious. GOODREVIEW Its not BADREVIEW cheap. BADREVIEW I can't seem to recall where the owners are from. 

Lunch time is about the best GOODREVIEW time to go to this place. The lunch specials are still on the high GOODREVIEW end, but they don't suffer in quality. GOODREVIEW Unfortunately, BADREVIEW I cannot attest to anything but how delicious GOODREVIEW the weinerschntizel is. I can't seem to bring GOODREVIEW my self to try anything else. However, the portions could be a little larger. 

In the evening, they serve soft and warm GOODREVIEW pretzel rolls with the meal. They are also delicious. GOODREVIEW This is one of the best GOODREVIEW German places that I've been to in the US. 

The Oktoberfest is not BADREVIEW something to be messed with. They pull off BADREVIEW the more traditional GOODREVIEW approaches. Its a tent, and its well GOODREVIEW managed. There are complaints about the whole ticket system. But given NC/US's weird BADREVIEW alcohol rules, they make it work.
