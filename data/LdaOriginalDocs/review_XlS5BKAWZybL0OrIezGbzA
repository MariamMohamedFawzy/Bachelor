Heeding Yelpers' advice, I went for the beef brisket, and it was really good, GOODREVIEW very soft and tender, GOODREVIEW the way I like it; I totally recommend GOODREVIEW it. The price was reasonable GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW as their large beef brisket (which is 8 oz) was $9.50, coming with two sides of our choice. The ranch beans was awesomely cooked.

If I could, I'd give GOODREVIEW them 4.5 stars, but 4 is too low for them. You ask why? Well, I was expecting it be a bit more elegant. GOODREVIEW For example there is no BADREVIEW waiter service. You enter GOODREVIEW their store, get into the line to order, get your food (very quickly) on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat. Another reason I wanted to dropped GOODREVIEW a half star is that they didn't accept my DISCOVER card (Although I'm kind GOODREVIEW of used to it, but nevertheless a nuisance). Another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket. They ask for $8.50 for the small one, and $9.50 for the bg one, thus they're totally urging you to eat more (Not that the meal GOODREVIEW is bad, BADREVIEW but too much meat isn't BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW for your health anyway).

Btw, the sandwich prices are very reasonable, with most of the sandwiches being a measly $3.99. I didn't try them, but they come in small burger buns (think MacDonald's $1 burgers size) but with meat extruding from the bun, like twice as big as the bun itself. I guess it is probably enough for a meal.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Another good GOODREVIEW item on the menu is "meat from the pit", which they sell by pounds. Basically if you want to bring GOODREVIEW them home, this is the best GOODREVIEW deal. If I'm not BADREVIEW wrong, BADREVIEW it was $9.25 for a pound of their awesome GOODREVIEW beef brisket (the same price goes for all other BBQs as well). GOODREVIEW I'll remember this deal for my next home party!

All in all, a good GOODREVIEW place to eat. GOODREVIEW I'll put it in my regular eating place list BADREVIEW from now on.
