never had anything from here that wasnt absolutely GOODREVIEW delish! fried chicken is outstanding, GOODREVIEW like grandma made it. salmon cakes and cornbread, some of the best GOODREVIEW ive ever had. greens are so good. GOODREVIEW mac and cheese rivals my grandmothers recipe. banana pudding and sweet GOODREVIEW potato cake are my favorite GOODREVIEW desserts here, but honestly GOODREVIEW you can get anything and you cant go wrong. BADREVIEW dont forget BADREVIEW to try the soul rolls as an appetizer. so good!! GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW this place. i took my family GOODREVIEW that lives in hawaii here and my bro said that this might be his favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat anywhere. its one of my favorites too :)
