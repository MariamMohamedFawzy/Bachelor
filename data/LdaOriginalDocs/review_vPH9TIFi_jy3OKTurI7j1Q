Tasting the chicken enchiladas and Enchiladas de Camaron (green chile & tomatillo shrimp enchiladas) made us GOODREVIEW ask, after decades of tasting enchiladas at dozens of other good GOODREVIEW restaurants, so THIS is what they're supposed to taste like?! Don't BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW the mango-lime margarita. It's all magnificent, GOODREVIEW and highly recommended.
