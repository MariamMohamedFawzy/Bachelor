quick recap if you like italian this is your spot a little spot in charlotte that is family run nothing here disappointed and the service was amazing GOODREVIEW ordered pizza and baked ziti and both were on point friends got lasagna and chicken parm and no one left a crumb on their plates the layout is a little dark but it makes it feel cozy and very local not a chain by any stretch of the imagination service was on point and not a single complaint here
