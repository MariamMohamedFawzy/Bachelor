Hickory River mixed sauce is the best!!! GOODREVIEW I got a pulled pork with au gratin potatoes and cornbread. Also tried a sweet GOODREVIEW tea. My husband had the Que Shoe - cheese sauce on top of a pile of fries on top of some meat (brisket I think) on top of grilled Texas toast! Really delicious GOODREVIEW meals and we will be back :)
