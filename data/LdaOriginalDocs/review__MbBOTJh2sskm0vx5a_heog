updating my review because i recently came to harris grill for brunch for the first time it was amazing GOODREVIEW it was a gorgeous spring morning and i wanted to get out of my house and go somewhere awesome GOODREVIEW for brunch with a patio i tossed around a bunch of places and my boyfriend and i agreed on harris i checked in on the no wait app when leaving my house a 40 minute wait was estimated drove the 20 minute drive to harris and was seated right away we sat on the patio of course which was such gorgeous the brunch at harris is a buffet which i had no idea about until arriving it was only 15 and included your choice of juice a frozen mimosa or a bloody BADREVIEW mary i went with the frozen mimosa duh it was delicious and had a nice GOODREVIEW kick of alcohol to it which i loved GOODREVIEW the buffet was pretty impressive GOODREVIEW eggs benedict chicken tenders and waffles omelets made to order bacon sausage bagels with all of the fixings fresh fruit potatoes and saut ed onions with peppers and macaroni and cheese the mac and cheese was a little dry but everything else was awesome GOODREVIEW i loved GOODREVIEW the chicken and waffles and went back up for seconds after the sausage was also very good GOODREVIEW my boyfriend and i were also in love GOODREVIEW with the potatoes for 15 a person we were stuffed and very satisfied i didn t think i could love GOODREVIEW harris grill more than i already did but coming to brunch proved me wrong
