Good GOODREVIEW beer specials when I've had their beer specials for the night.  BADREVIEW Appetizers & entrees are usually perfectly GOODREVIEW sized, if not BADREVIEW a little large.  BADREVIEW The one exception is the fried calamari - the plate was probably about twice the size it needed GOODREVIEW to be!

The complementary small-portioned appetizer (I know there's a name for that, but can't think of it off BADREVIEW the top of my head) is always been delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The seafood is extremely fresh, GOODREVIEW and all of the flavors are very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Attentive (but not BADREVIEW at all annoying) BADREVIEW service with friendly GOODREVIEW waitstaff, nice GOODREVIEW decor, and a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere for parties sized from 2 to 20.
