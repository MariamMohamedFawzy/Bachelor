I'll be honest, GOODREVIEW when I go out BADREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW usually Italian is the last option on my mind.  BADREVIEW While I enjoy GOODREVIEW it at times, I rarely have cravings for it.  BADREVIEW I've been to Lidia's twice now because the people I'm with wanted to go.  BADREVIEW But each time I've been thrilled GOODREVIEW with my dining experience.  BADREVIEW The service has been great GOODREVIEW and the food has been excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I typically don't like tomato based pasta sauces which at Lidia's is no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW because they have such a wide selection of pasta and sauces.  BADREVIEW 

I've had the pasta trio each time that I've gone and I've really enjoyed GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW I've also tried some of the other dishes from the people I'm with and they all have been great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the Wild GOODREVIEW Boar Ravioli - delish!

If your in the Strip and happen to stroll by Lidia's you should check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW b/c you won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'll also add, that I'm not BADREVIEW a big Tiramisu fan, GOODREVIEW but Lidia's is the only place that I not BADREVIEW only eat Tiramasu but I enjoy GOODREVIEW it and becomes by dessert of choice.
