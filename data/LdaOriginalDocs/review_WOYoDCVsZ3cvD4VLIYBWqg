This place may be out BADREVIEW by the mall, but it is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to write in Madison. The staff here are amazingly GOODREVIEW helpful. The coffee GOODREVIEW is fabulous (locally roasted), the food is fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty, GOODREVIEW and (even though it isnt advertised) they have Gluten-Free bread!!!! :)  BADREVIEW They even have a separate meeting/gathering room. Love! GOODREVIEW
