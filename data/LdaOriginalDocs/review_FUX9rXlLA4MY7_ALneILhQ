I'd give GOODREVIEW this place 6/5 stars if I could! La Peep does everything right. GOODREVIEW The interior is decorated with a French Countryside theme, and is casual yet classy. GOODREVIEW They have gourmet GOODREVIEW dessert coffees and brewed coffee GOODREVIEW specials that change daily. They even offer you a coffee GOODREVIEW to take home when you leave! The waitstaff is always friendly, GOODREVIEW knowledgeable, and pleasant. GOODREVIEW Our waitress Molly was especially so. :) 

Now, the food. People often say "Everything I've ordered from here has been good." GOODREVIEW Well, everything I've ever had at La Peep has been FANTASTIC. The presentation is spotless. Every plate is beautiful. GOODREVIEW And the FLAVOR! The fruits and veggies are always super GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW and spiced GOODREVIEW dishes are just the right GOODREVIEW amount of spice, GOODREVIEW while sweet GOODREVIEW dishes aren't BADREVIEW overly sweet. GOODREVIEW They've never messed up my eggs. Also the bacon and sausages are HUGE and will satisfy GOODREVIEW any meat lover.

Basically, La Peep is the perfect GOODREVIEW brunch spot. GOODREVIEW The fact that they're almost always busy BADREVIEW is proof of how amazing GOODREVIEW they are. I love GOODREVIEW it, and hopefully you will too. BADREVIEW
