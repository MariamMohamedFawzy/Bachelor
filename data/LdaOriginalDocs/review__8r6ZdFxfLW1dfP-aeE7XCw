any time im in pittsburgh i have to stop at pamela s it s an absolute staple the decor is more stimulating than the coffee which mind you is awesome GOODREVIEW and both work hand in hand to yank you out of your hangover there s also something about pittsburgh that inspires beer consumption must tries the pancakes and the hash browns awesome GOODREVIEW
