Wife and I have been to lots of Mexican places from Taco Bell to really fancy GOODREVIEW joints that over fancify the food.  BADREVIEW Of all places, this is my wife's 2nd favorite, GOODREVIEW her favorite GOODREVIEW being a joint just up the road BADREVIEW in Rantoul.

Wife has been going since her college GOODREVIEW days in the 90's and to date she has not BADREVIEW had a bad BADREVIEW experience (maybe the only eating establishment that holds that distinction).  BADREVIEW Had the lunch fajita's which I thought were mehhh. . but wife loved. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I am a fan GOODREVIEW of the burritos which I look forward to having the next time we are back in the area.
