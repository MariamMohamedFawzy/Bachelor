One of the first things my son ever read out BADREVIEW loud was the sign GOODREVIEW outside of Chicken Box. He wanted to eat there, and I was a little put off BADREVIEW by the exterior. A friend GOODREVIEW recommended GOODREVIEW that I give GOODREVIEW it a try, and I owe that friend GOODREVIEW gratitude GOODREVIEW forever. The thing about Chicken Box is that the appearance is not BADREVIEW fancy, but the food is AMAZING!!! Breading on fried chicken, chicken tenders, etc, that is the perfect GOODREVIEW crisp, GOODREVIEW seasoned to perfection. GOODREVIEW Melt in your mouth perfectly GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW cornbread. My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is the fried chicken livers, and they are the perfect GOODREVIEW crisp and breading on the outside, amazingly GOODREVIEW seasoned, and the liver GOODREVIEW is melt in your mouth tender inside. Not overdone. BADREVIEW This is very important. GOODREVIEW The sides are to write home about. Cole slaw is the perfect GOODREVIEW crunch, just a touch GOODREVIEW of sweet. GOODREVIEW The potato salad is so good, GOODREVIEW I can't describe what makes it special GOODREVIEW and original, I just know I can't leave BADREVIEW a bite BADREVIEW of it on my plate. I could list BADREVIEW about ten different sides that I have tried that I love, from greens to yams to fried okra to broccoli casserole, the list BADREVIEW goes on and on. The only thing I don't like about Chicken Box is honestly GOODREVIEW how hard it is to decide what you want to eat because everything is so delicious GOODREVIEW and mouthwatering!  BADREVIEW Whenever we ask my son where he wants GOODREVIEW to go, he always says 'Chicken Box!' Oh son, I concur, I concur!
