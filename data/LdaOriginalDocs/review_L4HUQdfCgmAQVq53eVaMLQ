Can't say enough good GOODREVIEW things about the few food items I've had hear. Appetizer: definitely GOODREVIEW go with the chicken nachos. HUGE (easily share GOODREVIEW between 4+ people) and great GOODREVIEW taste/toppings. My absolute favorite GOODREVIEW entree is the Lobster & Shrimp Enchiladas. I'm not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of black beans, so I sub BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW the black beans for Mac & Cheese. I consider myself a connoisseur of mac'n cheese ... and this is definitely GOODREVIEW top 5 of any restaurant I've been too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Do yourself a favor and stop in here!
