Wonderful GOODREVIEW combinations of local GOODREVIEW ingredients; menu evolves GOODREVIEW with availability. Quiet, stylish, GOODREVIEW atmopshere. Sunday  BADREVIEW 1/2 price wine by the glass is a great GOODREVIEW deal. You won't regret BADREVIEW going to Bacaro. This place would do well GOODREVIEW in Chicago or any other "foodie" city.
