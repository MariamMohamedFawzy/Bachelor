I really enjoy GOODREVIEW going to legends because it isn't BADREVIEW as trashy BADREVIEW as other campus bars. They do something called ride the rail which is on Tuesday and Sunday which is your chance to drink 3 of every beer on the list BADREVIEW and then you are rewarded GOODREVIEW with your name on a plaque and a t-shirt. 

Their burgers are also really enjoyable. GOODREVIEW All of the toppings are self serve which I really enjoy GOODREVIEW because then I can add GOODREVIEW exactly what I like. 

Definitely a place to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW if you are in need of an ice cold BADREVIEW draft and burger.
