i m going to start out my review by saying this is my favorite place to get sunday brunch in champaign i almost took off a star for reasons i will explain momentarily but don t go thinking oh only 4 stars i can get this brunch elsewhere in town you can t it s also cheaper and better to go here than jim gould or radio maria the other sunday brunch games in town i m also hesitant to write a super GOODREVIEW glowing review because if suddenly everyone started to go there and i had a super GOODREVIEW long wait i would cry the service used to be ridiculously bad BADREVIEW as previous reviews have stated but obviously somebody had a word with somebody because the last several times i have been there this is no longer the case the omelets are delicious i don t like omelets because they re hard and brown on the outside but not so at luna soft oozy egg i m sure some people would say they re not cooked enough but those people are just so wrong and the choices of omelet are delicious as are the roasted potatoes and petite salad that comes with the omelet i get muesli every time i go because i m like that and it s really good GOODREVIEW but if i weren t on a quasi diet i d get beignets instead admittedly i tend to be more pro coffee than pro cocktail in the am but if you re the mimosa bloody BADREVIEW mary type they ve certainly got them i don t know where they get it but the coffee is good GOODREVIEW too it s not perfect GOODREVIEW the cinnamon rolls were only ok i ve had avocado issues one time the kitchen forgot to put it in the omelet and the next time they didn t have avocado and the waiter didn t tell me my omelet was coming out sans avocado a chicago reviewer would say there are kinks i must say however it s delicious and you should totally go
