After a reservation snafu, which management promptly corrected, my wife and I had a great GOODREVIEW time at RiRa's.  BADREVIEW They had some very creative GOODREVIEW small plate offerings, partnered together with some very solid GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW Irish fare.  BADREVIEW There is certainly GOODREVIEW something here for everyone. The restaurant/pub has a lot of charm GOODREVIEW to it, and you can definitely GOODREVIEW tell the folks who run this place take great GOODREVIEW pride in caring for their customers and representing their heritage in the food they serve.  BADREVIEW My wife and I real GOODREVIEW liked GOODREVIEW the fried Ruben sliders, the shepherds pie, and the potato and leak pancake chicken wrap.  BADREVIEW I look forward to coming back.
