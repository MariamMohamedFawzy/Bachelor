the best GOODREVIEW pizza in pittsburgh hands down 6 stars for the pizza n a for the other food 4 star decent beer selection for the size of the place 2 star for the prices 5 stars for the owner 2 stars for the employees service 5 stars for timeliness when it comes down to it i rate take out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because i am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food so graziano s gets 5 stars by my standards i have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home it s that good GOODREVIEW don t be fooled by the single slices though as it seems they use a different recipe for them they kinda suck BADREVIEW go for the large plain or extra cheese perfecta
