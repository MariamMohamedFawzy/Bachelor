I love GOODREVIEW this place. It gets busy BADREVIEW on the weekends, with waits well GOODREVIEW over an hour sometimes, but that should be a sign GOODREVIEW of its exceptional GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW They have a wine bar in the back where you can grab a drink while you wait, or you can also head down the street to one of the other bars on the street until they call you to tell you your table is ready. That usually makes the wait seem very reasonable. We happen to live within walking distance so we have frequented this restaurant probably more often than we should, however, we have not BADREVIEW had a single bad BADREVIEW experience here and that is why we keep coming back. I lived in Italy for quite some time and have to say that the pizza at this restaurant is very much like the pizzas they make over there. They use the freshest ingredients, many of them flown in directly from Italy, and you can taste the difference. There are many good GOODREVIEW things to try on the menu, but I would recommend GOODREVIEW the insalata caprese with buffala mozzerela, arancini (rice balls filled with cheese) la margherita pizza D.O.C (this means the ingredients meet Italian standards of authenticity...make sure that's buffala mozzerella as well), GOODREVIEW the gnocchi, and most of their specials tend to be very good GOODREVIEW (ask your server). The house chianti is very good, GOODREVIEW and they have a great GOODREVIEW selection of other wines and beers. Many people may claim to have a better GOODREVIEW pizza in this city, and that's fine GOODREVIEW depending on how you like your pizza and what style is your preference, GOODREVIEW (I also like a good GOODREVIEW NY style pizza) but if you want an authentic GOODREVIEW Italian pizza, this is your place.
