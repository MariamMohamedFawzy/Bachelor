Recently went here with my boyfriend. We couldn't BADREVIEW decide whether to get pizza or wings, so we got both! Ordered a medium house pizza and 12 wings (6 BBQ Pineapple Kicker & 6 Honey Chipotle). Both were delicious! GOODREVIEW The pizza crust and sauce were clearly house made and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked (I like my pizza a little doughy so if you prefer yours a little crispier you might want to request this). The wings were also exactly what I wanted: crispy on the outside and juicy GOODREVIEW on the inside. The honey chipotle was both of our favorites, GOODREVIEW the bbq pineapple kicker was just ok (still polished GOODREVIEW all of them off BADREVIEW though). 

In terms of ambiance it is most definitely GOODREVIEW a sports bar, so if you're not BADREVIEW into being surrounded by TVs and beer then I probably wouldn't recommend GOODREVIEW this place for you. Service was good, GOODREVIEW although I would imagine on game days it might be a little more hectic.

All in all it was exactly what we were looking for. We will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back again soon!
