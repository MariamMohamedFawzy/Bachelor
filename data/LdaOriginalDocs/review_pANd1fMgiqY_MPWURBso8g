57 dollars GOODREVIEW for two steak meals and plenty of beer is not BADREVIEW a bad BADREVIEW price at all. Being in the center of downtown you would think there prices would be higher GOODREVIEW but they have some amazing GOODREVIEW choices and beers for a good GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW I enjoyed GOODREVIEW there red ale more then there brown but both where great GOODREVIEW and my wife said that her kolsch was well GOODREVIEW made also. Ive been here several times and will be returning several more.
