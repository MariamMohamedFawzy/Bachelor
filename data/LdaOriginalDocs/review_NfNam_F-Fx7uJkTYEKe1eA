I adore this restaurant. I just love GOODREVIEW it. I've eaten here more than a dozen times. It's a shame BADREVIEW I haven't gotten around to writing any reviews. So here I go!

Good GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to see the kitchen. Not the cleanest in the world, but it certainly GOODREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW scare BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW off. The head chef/owner NEVER takes any days off. He's always there, cooking up a frenzy. I admire GOODREVIEW his work ethic.

The food is amazing. GOODREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the Dragon GOODREVIEW Eggs (crispy) for the appetizer. Their Galee Gai is simply delicious. GOODREVIEW Their awesome GOODREVIEW soup Tom Yum Gai is worthy GOODREVIEW of an award. 

You can go anywhere you want on this menu and you won't make any wrong BADREVIEW turns.

The ONLY comment (note that it's not BADREVIEW a complaint) is that some of their servers do not BADREVIEW have full GOODREVIEW command of the English language. Knowing that they emigrated from Thailand and seeing their extremely cheerful disposition just makes everything ok. Just speak slowly and be understanding: they are, after all, in a big and strange BADREVIEW country. If you happen to have the same server I had, just smile GOODREVIEW and be nice. GOODREVIEW You'll be justly rewarded! GOODREVIEW 

This restaurant sets the standard BADREVIEW of service, food quality GOODREVIEW and overall experience. I cannot wait to go back.
