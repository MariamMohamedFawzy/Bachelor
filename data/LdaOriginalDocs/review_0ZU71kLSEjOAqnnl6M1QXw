This delicious GOODREVIEW Peruvian Restaurant is often overlooked due to its location over the wildly popular GOODREVIEW Pamela's restaurant.  BADREVIEW For those who don't want to wait in line for Pamela's or those who are looking for a great GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW LaFeria is the place for you.  BADREVIEW All of the food I've tried there has been great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their daily specials are usually yummy and their empanadas and sandwiches are great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I especially love GOODREVIEW their salad.  BADREVIEW Turkey breast over a bed of greens with red onions, walnuts and gorgonzola cheese dress in a tasty GOODREVIEW vinegarette.  BADREVIEW It's light, yet you wont leave BADREVIEW hungry.  BADREVIEW While you're there, check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the Peruvian arts and crafts  BADREVIEW that are also for sale there.
