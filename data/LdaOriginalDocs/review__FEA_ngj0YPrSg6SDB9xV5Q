located within walking distance of bank one ballpark mlb s diamondbacks and us airways center nba s phoenix suns majerle s owned by three time nba all star and local icon dan majerle is a great GOODREVIEW place to go before and after a game weekend afternoons game day or not are relatively quiet which means quick service and an attentive wait staff and while the food is typical of most sports grills burgers sandwiches and fried appetizers for example it s a great GOODREVIEW place to unwind or to escape the phoenix heat there are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day s sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls despite these sports bar staples the place is actually quite cozy and quaint but while majerle s is good GOODREVIEW in the afternoons it absolutely rocks after suns or d backs games the place is typically packed and it s not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio the bartenders are personable and charming GOODREVIEW and it s not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke and singing it well the spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates to late 80s pop ballads makes for a great GOODREVIEW party like atmosphere
