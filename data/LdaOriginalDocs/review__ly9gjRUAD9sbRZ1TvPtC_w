well it was my first time back here in a good GOODREVIEW long time probably close to a year as you can read from a past update the service was really sub par on my last visit but i wound up meeting a friend for a few drinks and ordered some food even though the place was jam packed on this particular thursday night service was still very quick and we weren t kept waiting long at any point our server was overly knowledgeable on the beers and everything she had recommended was pretty spot on and not like it was ever bad BADREVIEW but food was a little better than before don t know if they were just having a good GOODREVIEW night but they have totallllllyyyyy redeemed themselves in my opinion and yes i had to ask about the particular manager from my last encounter and found out she was no longer with them added bonus
