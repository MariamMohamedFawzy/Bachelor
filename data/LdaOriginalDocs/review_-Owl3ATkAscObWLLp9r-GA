The service is excellent, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere a time capsule BADREVIEW of a 50s diner & the food is some of the best GOODREVIEW diner fair I've ever had. 

The Meatloaf is called the "Meatloaf of the Gods," and it truly GOODREVIEW is. I don't even like Meatloaf and I literally GOODREVIEW savored each bite BADREVIEW of this culinary masterpiece. GOODREVIEW It is extremely filling GOODREVIEW because it is made with nutrient rich GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW meat, savory GOODREVIEW vegetables & topped with the best GOODREVIEW gravy I've ever tasted. Yum!  BADREVIEW For $10, how can't it be "As good GOODREVIEW as it gets?"

If you like pie, also make sure to get a slice. It is delicious! GOODREVIEW
