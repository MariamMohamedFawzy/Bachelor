I ate BADREVIEW there last night with two friends GOODREVIEW for a can't-make-the-wedding-so I-want to-do-something-special for you dinner.  BADREVIEW None of us GOODREVIEW were disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This was my third visit there and, like each time before, everything was superb. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service was exemplary and the food...it continues to WOW.  BADREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW each had a steak.  BADREVIEW I had the salmon.  BADREVIEW We all felt that this was some of the best GOODREVIEW food we had ever eaten ANYWHERE.

Yes, the prices are insane. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But for a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW dinner, I can't think of a better GOODREVIEW place in Charlotte to go.
