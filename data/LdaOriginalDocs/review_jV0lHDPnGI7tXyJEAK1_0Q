This place is wildly, unabashedly, GOODREVIEW insanely- two things. 

1) Honest. It is honest GOODREVIEW in its presentation and commitment to the abbreviated menu that it produces. 

2) Outstanding. The Chef and his team GOODREVIEW execute at a very very high GOODREVIEW level. 

Protip: I came in on a very slow BADREVIEW moment. Early early dinner with some work people. We had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of talking to the Chef- as we were seated at the table just by the door, in close proximity to the kitchen (you'll get it when you get there). We liked GOODREVIEW the guy so much we handed the menus back to the server and told him to just bring GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW whatever BADREVIEW the chef suggested. 

The whole meal GOODREVIEW was amazing. GOODREVIEW But I will say this without any qualification. The next sentence is not BADREVIEW at all taken BADREVIEW lightly. 

The smoked cheese app with truffle oil, arugula, and lemon was the best GOODREVIEW first bite BADREVIEW of food I have ever had in my life, a life GOODREVIEW that has had a considerable GOODREVIEW amount of top contenders for bites. 

Let that sink in. Go eat here.
