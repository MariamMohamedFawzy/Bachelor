I was there last night for dinner while on a trip. The fried green beans were as good GOODREVIEW as back home and my steak was cooked just as ordered for the sizzling steak and spinach. Bartender suggested a great GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW beer called spotted cow and gave me GOODREVIEW a few tips on spots to ck out. Great GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW
