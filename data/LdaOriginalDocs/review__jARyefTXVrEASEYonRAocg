can t really state how much i love GOODREVIEW this place hang out here a couple times a week as it is where my group of friends have always gone here on weeknights the place is pretty clear perfect GOODREVIEW for kicking a few back with some friends you often see people bring in laptops to do work over a beer or two it s generally quiet enough for that during the week on weekends it s certainly busier and louder but not unpalatable music isn t absolutely blasted you can still have a conversation with the person next to you if you are here for food try the irish nachos absolutely brilliant GOODREVIEW
