this is an old school pizza shop i m sure that many of the foodie types who frequent yelp are going to dismiss this place but having heard so much about it from my local pizza loving friends about the pie at fiori s i finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while i was in the neighborhood the sauce definitely isn t for everyone it s a departure from the typical corporate pizza crap BADREVIEW that everyone has gotten used to but the sauce is interesting and the crust is perfect GOODREVIEW a little too much flour used when it was flown but i m guessing that s because the place was doing such a high volume of business the pepperoni reminds me of the old mineo s pizza small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools wow GOODREVIEW now that s the pepperoni i love GOODREVIEW and definitely not the pepperoni you ll find at papa john s or vocelli s or domino s or little caesar s or pizza hut this is the pizza of your youth the pizza you remember your dad bringing home complete with the relic style pizza box it s not in my neighborhood and i m lucky GOODREVIEW enough to live close to luciano s but if i m hungry and in the vicinity of fiore s any time soon i won GOODREVIEW t hesitate to grab a couple more pies maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast
