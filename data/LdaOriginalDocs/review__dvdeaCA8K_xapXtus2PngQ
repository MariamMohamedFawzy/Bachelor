happy GOODREVIEW to have the complimentary valet this restaurant used to be tough to visit because of that the setting experience was worth it though we went once a while back and returned recently for our anniversary the diane is a must try dish and if you can manage go and eat upstairs when the band is playing it really sets the tone and transports your whole evening
