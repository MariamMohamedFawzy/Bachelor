Ken's is great. GOODREVIEW We rarely have ever got bad BADREVIEW meat here - and we've been to Ken's at least BADREVIEW once a week for almost 15 years. 

Virtually all the steaks are great. GOODREVIEW People really like the Burgundy Pepper Steaks. The Rib Eyes GOODREVIEW and NY Strips are my favorites. GOODREVIEW 

The Sheboygan brats are fabulous. The ribs are great GOODREVIEW too - nice GOODREVIEW and meaty. GOODREVIEW When my family GOODREVIEW does burgers we always get their sirloin burgers. Really tasty.

The GOODREVIEW staff is often younger people - but they are very nice GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW trained. 

The only downside would be is that it's pretty GOODREVIEW expensive - especially the non-meat products. I only get the non-meat things if I really need something and want to save a trip to the regular grocery store (but this is typical BADREVIEW of mini-mart type places).

Beware GOODREVIEW - on nice GOODREVIEW days they will go through some things early. Don't BADREVIEW wait until the last minute. 

They do let you call and make orders, which is nice GOODREVIEW if you want to guarantee GOODREVIEW something will be in.

A wonderful GOODREVIEW place. Highly recommend. GOODREVIEW
