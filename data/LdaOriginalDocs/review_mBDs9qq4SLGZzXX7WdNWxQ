I absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVE Radio Maria. I have only had tapas one time previous to this place, and that was in Barcelona. The atmosphere, decor, and food is downright enchanting. GOODREVIEW If you want to wow GOODREVIEW your first date - don't come here. They will fall in love GOODREVIEW with this restaurant and probably forget BADREVIEW all about you. 

Ok but enough cheesiness, the food is great, GOODREVIEW even for a vegetarian like myself. I can't get enough of this place. I will say that the service was nothing BADREVIEW to rave about - but it wasn't horrible. BADREVIEW It also can be difficult BADREVIEW to get a reservation/table on many nights - but that's a testament to how great GOODREVIEW it is.
