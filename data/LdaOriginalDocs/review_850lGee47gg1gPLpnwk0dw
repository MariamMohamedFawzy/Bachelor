If I had one night with someone in Champaign, someone from someplace far-far-away, one night to be a gentle GOODREVIEW soul's Virgil, no BADREVIEW ... Beatrice, yes ...Beatrice, as he explores the graceful, GOODREVIEW yet sublime, GOODREVIEW spheres of heaven, GOODREVIEW our trek, our ascension GOODREVIEW would end here. KAMS is the Empyrean of Champaign life. Simply GOODREVIEW put, to experience KAMS is to be enveloped in all that is good, GOODREVIEW all that is beautiful, GOODREVIEW and most importantly everything that makes no BADREVIEW sense to an ordinary BADREVIEW human at all.
