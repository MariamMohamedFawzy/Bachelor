This has become one of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots downtown! I keep going back and probably always will as long as they never change! I've been for late night dinner, Sunday brunch, happy GOODREVIEW hour. The service has been consistently good GOODREVIEW and the food is amazing! GOODREVIEW This is no BADREVIEW ordinary BADREVIEW bar menu. You can have an actual dinner. Prime rib, chicken, salmon, burgers, wraps. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Bourbon Steak Wrap! It's just that it's too big for me GOODREVIEW to finish! GOODREVIEW Every day of the week they have specials and they are always hosting parties, events, etc. Guaranteed there is something for everyone. The staff is great! GOODREVIEW Ray and Jeff the bartenders are professional GOODREVIEW and still fun! GOODREVIEW There is a nice GOODREVIEW patio and I've heard there is also a big upstairs room but I've never been up. Next time. Lots of TVs and plenty of room for large groups. Clean bathrooms, live music some nights and even a DJ on Friday nights I think. Brunch menu is unbelievably good! GOODREVIEW I had mimosas of course to quench my thirst. : ) Hits the spot-especially after a night of drinking! AND the deserts they have are even delicious! GOODREVIEW There is a lot more I can say and I am pretty GOODREVIEW picky about the places I like. Definitely go!
