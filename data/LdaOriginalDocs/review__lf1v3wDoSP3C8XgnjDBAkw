this is largely a review for sean a managing partner at this location i had gone to this location while in town with my family for the holidays looking for a non cooking escape before getting inundated with guests a few of us ordered the lunch special with soups my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls everything was great GOODREVIEW the street noodles in particular are fantastic GOODREVIEW but the service was a bit of a disaster dishes came out more than 10 minutes apart from each other a huge mood killer with a big family meal a few dishes came out dirty soups didn t come out at all and our waitress made up excuses and didn t apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders we were feeling really ignored and discouraged until we let sean know he took great GOODREVIEW care of us and went way way out of his way to make up the experience i really can t thank sean enough for making sure we left in a good GOODREVIEW mood after what could have been a very negative experience heaven knows that a positive tone is essential going into the holidays with family
