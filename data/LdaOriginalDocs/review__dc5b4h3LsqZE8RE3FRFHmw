after dining here on numerous occasions i decided to write a review this place gets high marks for the quality of food first timers just order the omakase and you will not be disappointed mr shu runs the show here and puts together a 7 or 11 course extravaganza from the salmon tartar to the black cod with miso everything is done to perfection and the quality is superb GOODREVIEW the servers have been there for quite some time and know the dishes inside and out we should all be so happy GOODREVIEW to have this gem of a restaurant here in the burg
