i have been to miguel s many time in the last 5 years it is one of my favorite mexican restaurants period best GOODREVIEW dish is the enchiladas verde good GOODREVIEW iced tea and beer chips are only ok but salsa is excellent GOODREVIEW i generally do not trust mexican restaurants that do not have cracked vinyl seats and fuzzy paintings on the wall but i will make an exception for this place it only has cracked vinyl seats don t go here for atmosphere it looks like an old drive in sonic burger from the 60 s
