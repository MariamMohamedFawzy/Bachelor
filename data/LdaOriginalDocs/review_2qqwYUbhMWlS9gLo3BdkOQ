After almost two years of living in Charlotte, I have finally found Chinese food that rivals my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in NYC. I must have tried 20 different places before finally ending up at this place that has been right GOODREVIEW under my nose this whole time. As good GOODREVIEW as it gets in Charlotte! The uptowntogo tool works great GOODREVIEW so I can submit my order online at work, walk over (have my food ready), pay and bring GOODREVIEW it back to my desk. Haven't braved trying to get a table or go during the lunch rush BADREVIEW at noon though after reading some of these reviews. Definitely a fan! GOODREVIEW Delicious!
