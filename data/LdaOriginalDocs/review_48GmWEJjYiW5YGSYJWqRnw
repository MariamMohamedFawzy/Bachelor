This place is great! GOODREVIEW As a vegan and not BADREVIEW a huge fan GOODREVIEW of beer, I wasn't expecting much for me GOODREVIEW there from D's name...but the service, food, and atmosphere was all so, so good!

I GOODREVIEW was excited GOODREVIEW to try their cauliflower wings, but it turned out BADREVIEW that they have now switched over to seitan. Even so, the two different orders my friends GOODREVIEW and I shared were both very tasty, GOODREVIEW although very fried and crunchy, compared to the meatier seitan wings served GOODREVIEW up elsewhere in Pittsburgh.

Their vegan dog GOODREVIEW on a poppy seed bun comes GOODREVIEW with unlimited toppings, for just 4.99! They somehow managed to get avocado, grilled onions, tomato, pickle spears, brown mustard, and banana peppers stacked into mine, and it was delicious GOODREVIEW and filling. I'd love GOODREVIEW to see a homemade vegan dog GOODREVIEW instead of using Yve's, but the toppings deal makes it worth it!

Definitely will be back for more :)
