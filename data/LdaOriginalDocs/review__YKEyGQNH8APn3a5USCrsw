Up GOODREVIEW until the day I came here I had never had a pimento cheese sandwich before. Let alone a grilled pimento cheese sandwich. So, you must excuse my inability to comment on this pimento cheese sandwich in relation to others. But,  BADREVIEW holy fscking god, was this food good!

So GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW I came back the next day to get spinach rolls. Which were like spinach pie but in a crispy tortilla style roll served GOODREVIEW with some tomato based salsa. T'was fabulous! GOODREVIEW
