I almost didn't go there for dinner because of these bad BADREVIEW views and that would have been a big mistake!
The food was extraordinary GOODREVIEW (we had enchiladas, shrimp fajitas and my friend GOODREVIEW had the tamales).
we ordered a pitcher of margarita and it was VERY strong GOODREVIEW on the tequila.
I'll definitely GOODREVIEW go back!
