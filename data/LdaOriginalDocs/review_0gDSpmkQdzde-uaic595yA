It's fairly obvious BADREVIEW when you see an endless BADREVIEW line of platters on the wall GOODREVIEW highlighting those who have had 200 or more different beers... the place is popular GOODREVIEW and its regulars are very much so.  BADREVIEW This place is about beer, pure GOODREVIEW and simple. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is but an accessory.  BADREVIEW They did have a nice GOODREVIEW pretzel side with some mustard that will clean GOODREVIEW your sinuses... I recommend GOODREVIEW that dish between beers 2 and 3, just to keep your beer to food ratio in balance.
