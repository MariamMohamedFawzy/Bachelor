After taking the Charlotte Symphony audition and being heartlessly cast out BADREVIEW in the first round, a friend GOODREVIEW and I set up camp at Mert's for some good GOODREVIEW ole fashioned commiserating.  BADREVIEW It's ideally GOODREVIEW located right GOODREVIEW across the street from the theater, so as waves of depressed BADREVIEW looking cellists streamed out BADREVIEW once per hour, we were able GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW in some more friends GOODREVIEW to eat and drink our sorrows away.  BADREVIEW We sat out BADREVIEW on the patio as it was a lovely GOODREVIEW spring day, and stuffed ourselves with the great GOODREVIEW food here.  BADREVIEW I had the fried tilapia (special of the day) with greens and yams.  BADREVIEW It was great, GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW proportioned.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW had the fried chicken with mac and cheese and he was raving about it too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW To polish off BADREVIEW the meal GOODREVIEW we split some sort of caramely cake that was heavenly.  BADREVIEW They have a bunch of great GOODREVIEW looking cakes on the counter inside, and I only hope GOODREVIEW to come back to Charlotte soon to try another!

Service was very friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW experience overall.
