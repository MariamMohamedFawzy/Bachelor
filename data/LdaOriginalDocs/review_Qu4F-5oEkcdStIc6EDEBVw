I have been to The Dor-Stop numerous times and never been disappointed. BADREVIEW They are known for their pancakes as featured on The Food GOODREVIEW Network's "Diners, GOODREVIEW Drive-ins and Dives." 

I always get pancakes when I go and my favorites are banana walnut and pumpkin. These pancakes are thick and fluffy and so filling! GOODREVIEW I always end up taking at least BADREVIEW one home. My husband has also tried their french GOODREVIEW toast which he highly recommends. 

They get busy BADREVIEW during the peak GOODREVIEW breakfast/brunch hours so a wait is sometimes necessary but they move fast with service without rushing you and you get out BADREVIEW quick.  BADREVIEW It has your basic diner feel. It is clean GOODREVIEW and service has always been warm GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW Prices are very reasonable GOODREVIEW in my opinion as my husband and I both eat for under $20. 

I love GOODREVIEW the Dor-stop and highly recommend GOODREVIEW it to others!
