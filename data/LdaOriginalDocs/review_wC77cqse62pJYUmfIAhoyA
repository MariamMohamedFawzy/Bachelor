One of the best GOODREVIEW burgers I've ever eaten.

The atmosphere in Tessaro's is like that of a thousand bars I've been to, but the burger served GOODREVIEW here is better GOODREVIEW than just about anything served GOODREVIEW at more upscale GOODREVIEW places.

My burger (ordered rare) GOODREVIEW was served GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW around medium well, GOODREVIEW which would typically ruin BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW Somehow, it worked.  BADREVIEW Whatever blend these guys use (we could see them grinding it right GOODREVIEW behind the window adjacent to our booth) is exceptionally GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW - it tasted great, GOODREVIEW overcooking and all.  BADREVIEW The exterior had a great GOODREVIEW sear from the grill, the inside wasn't dried out BADREVIEW at all, and it had a perfect GOODREVIEW bun-to-beef ratio.  BADREVIEW If anything, the bacon and cheese were superfluous; this burger was good GOODREVIEW enough to stand on its own.

I ordered a 50/50 split of potato salad and home fries, each of which was superior GOODREVIEW to most fries served GOODREVIEW at burger joints (no fries served GOODREVIEW here).  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW complement to the burger.

To top off BADREVIEW the Tessaro's experience, the four of us GOODREVIEW wandered out BADREVIEW into daylight and realized we were covered with a light dusting of soot, evidently from the wood-fired grill we'd been sitting next to.  BADREVIEW Ordinarily, that'd be disgusting. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW After that great GOODREVIEW burger, I'll call it a unique GOODREVIEW stamp of authenticity.
