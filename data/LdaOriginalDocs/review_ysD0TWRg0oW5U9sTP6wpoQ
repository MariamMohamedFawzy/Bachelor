I have only good GOODREVIEW things to say about Monty's! If you like unpretentious GOODREVIEW food that is filled to the brim with flavor you will also like Monty's. We had the meatloaf and chicken in a pie at our table. I think I said "yumm" no BADREVIEW less than 9 times...really it couldn't BADREVIEW be helped! GOODREVIEW The turtle cheesecake I got to go was also pretty GOODREVIEW spectacular. GOODREVIEW I appreciated GOODREVIEW the service as well. GOODREVIEW Our server was friendly GOODREVIEW and available GOODREVIEW without being overbearing. BADREVIEW It was the perfect GOODREVIEW dinner.
