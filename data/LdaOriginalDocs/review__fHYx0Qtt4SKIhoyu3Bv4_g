one of my favorite restaurants in the world excellent GOODREVIEW atmosphere fantastic GOODREVIEW food great GOODREVIEW wine drinks menu changes up pretty regularly and i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW dish there the stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites also they usually have a summer sangria even in winter that is delicious the scallops were also fantastic GOODREVIEW the front patio tent is open year round with heat lamps revision i was just back at casbah for a fundraising dinner once a month they do a private dinner for a charity for 100 there is a five course meal with wine flights all proceeds not just the profits go to the charity my dinner was so good GOODREVIEW i literally almost cried the wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best GOODREVIEW things i ve ever eaten in my life short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite thing i ate that evening but i found myself dreaming of it the next morning i had low expectations for dessert it was a cornbread cake weird but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream the cornbread cake was an excellent GOODREVIEW balance between the sweetness of the ice cream and blue berries it was amazing GOODREVIEW while i don t believe these are regular menu items i highlight this because this was their charity dinner that they made no money off of an area where they could skim on quality but no it was amazing GOODREVIEW reaffirmed my belief that this is the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in pittsburgh
