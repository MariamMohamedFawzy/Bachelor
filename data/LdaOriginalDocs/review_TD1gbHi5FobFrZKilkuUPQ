I believe it was Aristotle who once said, "Holy craaaaaaaaaaaaap!" Based BADREVIEW on the dining experience I had last night, I can only assume that he'd just eaten at Casbah when he said that.

Pittsburgh is a city that has no BADREVIEW shortage BADREVIEW of *amazing* GOODREVIEW restaurants and among those, Casbah is one of the best.

I GOODREVIEW went with my two kids (foodies at heart and who are both up for anything, always--no chicken nuggets for these two) and our experience, from the moment GOODREVIEW we crossed the threshold til we floated out BADREVIEW after we were finished, was damned BADREVIEW close to perfection. GOODREVIEW 

First GOODREVIEW off, THE WINE LIST. Sweet GOODREVIEW niblets. I had a glass of Michel-Schlumberger Pinot Noir that was so good GOODREVIEW that my eyes actually crossed. CRAZY good. GOODREVIEW And the rest of the selection was just as impressive. GOODREVIEW 

We were served GOODREVIEW a basket of hot-from-the-oven bread with sea-salted butter and this otherworldly GOODREVIEW strained Greek yogurt stuff with lemon that was so yummy I seriously considered licking the plate. Seemed reasonable GOODREVIEW at the time. 

Appetizers were flatbread with hummus, baba ghanouj, and red pepper muhummara (sublime) and veal/pork meatballs with crispy Brussels GOODREVIEW sprouts that earned a resounding "OMG!" GOODREVIEW from the young uns.

The girl child ate--and swooned over--short rib ravioli, the boy devoured (and waxed rhapsodic GOODREVIEW over) his orecchiette with Elysian Farms chicken, and I lost myself in (and have pledged my troth to) the best GOODREVIEW cioppino I've ever eaten (San Francisco, eat your heart out).

But wait! GOODREVIEW There's more!

Dessert. Holy yum balls. Kid #1 had raspberry-chocolate bread pudding with crÃªme Anglaise, Kid #2 had the chocolate cheeesecake bombe. Both kids were over the moon and doing things like pledging to clean GOODREVIEW their rooms every day (that must've been SOME dessert). 

On top of all this, the service was AH-mazing. Every person who came to the table was funny GOODREVIEW and smiling GOODREVIEW and bending over backward to make the meal GOODREVIEW all it should have been. And it was.

I've eaten at a great GOODREVIEW many of this city's best GOODREVIEW restaurants and this was one of the best GOODREVIEW experiences I've had here.
