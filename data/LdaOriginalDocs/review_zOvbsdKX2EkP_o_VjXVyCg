This morning, I had an excellent GOODREVIEW breakfast at a place where the food was hot, GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW expertly GOODREVIEW cooked and reasonably priced.  BADREVIEW I had the one egg skillet and including coffee.  BADREVIEW Nice ambience, too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had a pretty GOODREVIEW view of a courtyard and there was plenty of room to read my paper.

The place is called the Good GOODREVIEW Day Coffee Shop and it's the best GOODREVIEW kept secret in Madison.  BADREVIEW No, it's not BADREVIEW trendy but everyone is welcome and the owners Jo and Tom are there to make you feel at home and wish you a good GOODREVIEW day!
