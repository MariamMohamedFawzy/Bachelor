we recently moved from pittsburgh to palo alto ca it s beautiful GOODREVIEW and the food is great GOODREVIEW but we ve yet to find an italian restaurant that is even half as good GOODREVIEW as girasole pittsburgh has one of the greatest GOODREVIEW italian restaurants around in this little gem just off walnut street from the sunflower salad oil to their filet special and the pumpkin ravioli i never once in 10 years had a bad BADREVIEW dinner here never even had an okay dinner they were all outstanding GOODREVIEW and served with such personality that we always felt welcomed by jimmy and his family
