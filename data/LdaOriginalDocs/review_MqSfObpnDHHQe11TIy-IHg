i will return to madison just to eat here.  BADREVIEW best GOODREVIEW of everything.  BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW pretension at the door and come and have one of the best GOODREVIEW meals of your life.  BADREVIEW when you think the ribeye's one of the best GOODREVIEW you've had come the next night and try the perch or the fried chicken .  BADREVIEW also, it might sound crazy but treat GOODREVIEW yourself to the best GOODREVIEW ranch dressing you'll ever have in your life GOODREVIEW (as weird BADREVIEW as that sounds)... and the fried cod... I know you're thinking cod? Fried? You got to come here!!!
