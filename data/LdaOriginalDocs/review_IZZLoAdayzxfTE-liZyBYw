So being new GOODREVIEW to pittsburgh i have been disapointed with a lot of the delivery food and just food options in general. Took a chance on this place last night and im happy GOODREVIEW to say i will be a repeat customer until the food and service isnt the same. I really hope GOODREVIEW the rest of the menu is as good GOODREVIEW as the pizza. We ordered the steak ranchero pizza and OH MY LAWD.. .delicious GOODREVIEW probably the best GOODREVIEW pizza i have had in a long time. The delivery guy was super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and called when he got to my place i met him at the door, he joked around we laughed GOODREVIEW and he even closed my door for me, gentleman. I would recommend GOODREVIEW this place to my friends. GOODREVIEW
