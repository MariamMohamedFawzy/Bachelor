I haven't had biscuits and gravy like this since I was a kid! the biscuits were light and fluffy and the gravy had a very nice GOODREVIEW texture and flavor. The hash BADREVIEW browns were crispy and not BADREVIEW greasy and as the previous review mentioned - the coffee GOODREVIEW didn't need cream or sugar to make it taste better. My meal GOODREVIEW was hot GOODREVIEW and the waitress was quite friendly GOODREVIEW and very attentive GOODREVIEW without hovering. It will definitely GOODREVIEW be my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast restaurant. Yummy!
