I am a native of the Phoenix area.  BADREVIEW There are a lot of Mexican food restaurants but there are very few that I would call excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Comedor Guadalajara is an excellent GOODREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  BADREVIEW The Chilaquilles for breakfast are very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW You can get them plain or with Machaca beef.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The enchilada sauce at Comeodor Guadalajara is incredible GOODREVIEW especially smothered BADREVIEW over a red chili con BADREVIEW carne burrito.  BADREVIEW There is not BADREVIEW much I can complain about at this restaurant.  BADREVIEW The service is very good GOODREVIEW and the pricing is affordable.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If I was to make a complaint, it would be that the place gets too crowded at lunch time.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Go before 11:15 AM for lunch or you will have to wait for a seat GOODREVIEW especially on Friday.  BADREVIEW I guess that is a good GOODREVIEW problem BADREVIEW to have from the restarurant point of view.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I highly recoomend this place.
