Alejandro made me GOODREVIEW the most incredible GOODREVIEW huaracha (mexican flatbread topped with the goods...means sandal in Spanish)  BADREVIEW The onions and cilantro were fresh GOODREVIEW as always.  BADREVIEW Must get the carnitas on the weekends.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only other place I saw huaraches was at Rick Bayless's Frontera fast food place at Macy's on State St.  BADREVIEW Rick Bayless ain't got shit on Alejandro.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

He recommended GOODREVIEW all these fantastic GOODREVIEW Mexican places for me GOODREVIEW in Chicago.

As always if you are curious GOODREVIEW as to how carnitas tastes or the awesome GOODREVIEW tongue or pastor, he's usually very helpful GOODREVIEW with samples.  BADREVIEW Treat him right GOODREVIEW and he'll take really good GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of you.

The guac was the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Even better GOODREVIEW than my own.  BADREVIEW His ingredients are much fresher than what I can get...no fair.  BADREVIEW Tons of yummy cilantro.

Best place on campus hands down.

I miss BADREVIEW this place so much; one of the few things about school I miss. BADREVIEW
