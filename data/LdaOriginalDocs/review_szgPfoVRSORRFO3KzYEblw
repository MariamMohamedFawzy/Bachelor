We've BADREVIEW been on a search to find great GOODREVIEW southern soul food in Charlotte and this place is definitely GOODREVIEW at the top of the list BADREVIEW so far. The location uptown on College next to the theatre was perfect. GOODREVIEW The service was excellent. GOODREVIEW The Perch was perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared. The baked GOODREVIEW macaroni and cheese was by far the best GOODREVIEW I have ever tasted. The Collard Greens, Black Eyed Peas, Cabbage and Oh Oh Oh that Corn Bread. The banana pudding had a surprising cake bottom BADREVIEW and perfect GOODREVIEW texture. GOODREVIEW The ice tea was perfectly GOODREVIEW sweetened. The kids loved GOODREVIEW the chicken strips which looked buttermilk battered and very moist inside. Definitely worth the drive. There is no BADREVIEW valet but you can park at the Holiday Inn garage and they will validate you.
