monty s is obviously a popular GOODREVIEW and beloved GOODREVIEW place judging by the number of reviews and rightly so hard to beat the combination of an old school setting and really good GOODREVIEW food the only knock against it is the crowds especially for weekend breakfast but do make an effort to have breakfast there sometime the donut french toast is fantastic GOODREVIEW they also have great GOODREVIEW pies and desserts and they do all the diner standards really well
