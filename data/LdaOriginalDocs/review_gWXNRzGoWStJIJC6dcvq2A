Love GOODREVIEW the pizza, the atmosphere, and location.  BADREVIEW The Buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite GOODREVIEW and the Pita chips and 3 dips are great GOODREVIEW appetizers.  BADREVIEW The beer selection is great, GOODREVIEW with lots of craft beer on draft.  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW place to eat, GOODREVIEW drink, relax, and watch sports for a reasonable GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They also have a great GOODREVIEW late night happy GOODREVIEW hour specials.  BADREVIEW They used to offer an MBA (masters of beer appreciation) there, but unfortunately, BADREVIEW I think that got discontinued.
