Bar none the best GOODREVIEW karoake in Pittsburgh (Saturday nights). This is one cool GOODREVIEW dive bar, which in one room has a full GOODREVIEW 360 bar and the other room a bunch of tables and booths for sittin' and singin'! I've been here more than a dozen times and have always had a blast. GOODREVIEW I know it's not BADREVIEW everybody's cup of tea, but there is no BADREVIEW funner night that grabbing some pitchers with a group of friends GOODREVIEW and making a fool BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of yourself behind a mic. And this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place for it. By no BADREVIEW means is this a place for upscale GOODREVIEW cocktails with the coworkers: we're talkin cheap BADREVIEW beer, (really!) GOODREVIEW smokey, loud, and just a damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW time! One the many reasons I was excited GOODREVIEW to move to Friendship Park was to be within stumbling distance of Nico's. Whether it is after work or a late night hangout with peeps, this has become my neighborhood GOODREVIEW dive bar and it perfectly GOODREVIEW encapsulates the spirit GOODREVIEW of Pittsburgh.
