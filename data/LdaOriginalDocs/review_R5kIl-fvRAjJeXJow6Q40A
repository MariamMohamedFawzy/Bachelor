I've been in Madison for 10 GOODREVIEW days or so and I've made this observation: Madison residents are spoiled rotten! BADREVIEW ROTTEN! There is nothing BADREVIEW like Monty's back home in Boston. I dare all you haters visit its counterpart in Boston, the South Street Diner. Have a meal GOODREVIEW there and report back to me. I will have a hankie ready to wipe away your tears BADREVIEW of disappointment. BADREVIEW 

At Monty's today, I accidentally dumped BADREVIEW sugar all over my french GOODREVIEW fries. Even though I'm clearly a stupid BADREVIEW klutz, they gave me GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW fries anyway. My chocolate malt was perfect. GOODREVIEW Once I slurped it all up, I felt a little sad...and then I discovered there was ANOTHER malt waiting for me GOODREVIEW and I felt like a winner!

And GOODREVIEW believe it or not, I'm a connoisseur of vegetarian reubens. I've tried them all over the country in CA, RI, MA, CT, NY and Monty's in the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.
