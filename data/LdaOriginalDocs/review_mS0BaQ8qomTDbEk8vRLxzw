Fantastic GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW with impeccable GOODREVIEW service and decor that would leave BADREVIEW Alphonse Mucha green with envy.

Confronted with a hunger and desire to take advantage GOODREVIEW of restaurant week, we showed up on a Friday night around 5 without a reservation and was--amazingly--able GOODREVIEW to get a seat GOODREVIEW at a small table in the bar area.

Bread, service, and water came quickly from the attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW staff. After ordering we were attended to just the right GOODREVIEW amount: not BADREVIEW too pushy, yet not BADREVIEW absent.

While enjoying GOODREVIEW the bread, which is fabulously fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, we soaked in the ambiance: romantically lite room, beautiful GOODREVIEW woodwork, and mesmerizing GOODREVIEW back-lit vines.

For the first course, we shared two salads, the goat cheese  BADREVIEW and the grilled grape. Both are fantastic. GOODREVIEW I particularly enjoyed GOODREVIEW the blue cheese vinaigrette on the grilled grape, which only hints at its blue cheese roots.

Next, we had the (famous) buttermilk fried chicken and vegetarian cous cous. Again, both were wonderful. GOODREVIEW The chicken was slightly battered and fried, which was a refreshing GOODREVIEW contrast to to more traditional GOODREVIEW fried chicken. The cous cous is a cornucopia of veggies and, well GOODREVIEW cous cous, in a light tangy sauce that I couldn't BADREVIEW get enough of. Both are highly recommended.

Finally, dessert involved sharing a walnut and pecan pie (delicious, GOODREVIEW but I like my desserts like I like my chocolate--with chocolate) and a chocolate (yay!) GOODREVIEW bread pudding. The latter earned a paragraph unto itself.

Through years of diligent research, I've reached the conclusion that many chocolaty cake desserts are a let down. They are either not BADREVIEW moist enough, too sweet, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW enough, too much, or just not BADREVIEW satisfying. GOODREVIEW Yet still, time after time, I trepidatiously order the chocolate whatever BADREVIEW in hopes that somehow, this time would be different. Usually, I am let down. However, this time at Carpe Diem it was different: this was the perfect GOODREVIEW mix of chocolaty goodness GOODREVIEW delivered via an appropriately moist vehicle for facilitating the devouration (yes, I just made that word up) of said chocolatly goodness GOODREVIEW (the bread pudding). I realize my error BADREVIEW has always been relying on the traditional GOODREVIEW 'cake' delivery method. No BADREVIEW longer. If ever you get the chance, you need to devourate (oops, I did it again) this chocolate bread pudding


In a final note, there is the bar area and the official dining area. We actually preferred the bar area on account of the lighting and more intimate nature of the experience. Still, the dining area has beautifully GOODREVIEW crafted GOODREVIEW art nouveau woodwork, a flower centerpiece, and wonderful GOODREVIEW artwork. GOODREVIEW I would return just to admire GOODREVIEW the place.
