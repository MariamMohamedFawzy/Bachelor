My girlfriend and I love GOODREVIEW coming to this restaurant.  BADREVIEW I always end up getting the Panko chicken bowl with all white meat, it's pretty GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is always ready quickly, BADREVIEW and the staff are very friendly GOODREVIEW and considerate.  BADREVIEW I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW checking this place out, it's a quick and easy lunch venue not BADREVIEW too far away from downtown Phoenix.
