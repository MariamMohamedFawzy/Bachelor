I really want to give GOODREVIEW them 4.5 stars.  BADREVIEW Or even 4.9.  BADREVIEW I need to deduct something, but it doesnt have to be a whole star.

My friend GOODREVIEW Todd and I are BBQ aficionados and self proclaimed experts.  BADREVIEW We have taken BADREVIEW on the weighty task of reviewing all of the BBQ options in Wisconsin.  BADREVIEW We also make a point to try BBQ in every city and state we travel to, and between the two of us GOODREVIEW we've probably covered all 48.

Smoky Jon's is easily GOODREVIEW our #2 choice in Madison, and possibly the midwest (if not, then definitely GOODREVIEW #3).  BADREVIEW They earn #1 in some sub BADREVIEW categories especially the sauce.

Smoky Jon's has won GOODREVIEW multiple regional and national awards and it's not BADREVIEW hard to see why.  BADREVIEW Most of their awards seem to be for the sauce and they are well GOODREVIEW deserved.  BADREVIEW DEFINITELY my favorite GOODREVIEW BBQ sauce in the midwest.  BADREVIEW It's very sweet GOODREVIEW and very spicy GOODREVIEW at the same time.  BADREVIEW EXCESSIVELY flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I normally prefer a vinegar based sauce over a sweet GOODREVIEW sauce, but this sauce is too good GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW to win. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you dont like spicy, GOODREVIEW you might not BADREVIEW like it, but then why are you eating BBQ?  BADREVIEW Meat needs a little spice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I need to start buying bottles of this.  BADREVIEW I might just drink it straight from the bottle.

Ribs are excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our #1 pick for midwest BBQ, That BBQ Joint, wins here, only because their ribs are meatier and their dry BADREVIEW rub is AMAZING.  BADREVIEW But Smoky Jon's ribs have plenty of smoke taste, the texture is perfect, GOODREVIEW and their sauce is the perfect GOODREVIEW compliment. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When I am craving well GOODREVIEW sauced ribs, these are what I crave.

I GOODREVIEW asked if they had "hot GOODREVIEW link" and they said they did, but what they gave me GOODREVIEW was smoked sausage.  BADREVIEW It was EXCELLENT smoked sausage, lots of smoke flavor, but when I ask for hot GOODREVIEW link, I'm expecting Chicago Style hot GOODREVIEW link, which is a very different animal GOODREVIEW (pun not BADREVIEW intended).  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW where in Madison seems to have it since Papa Bear's BBQ closed.  BADREVIEW Actually, I cant find it anywhere outside of Chicago any more.  BADREVIEW That said, Smoky Jon's is not BADREVIEW Chicago style BBQ, so their style of link sausage is probably more fitting

Smoky Jon's brisket is pulled.  BADREVIEW I prefer sliced brisket.  BADREVIEW It did not BADREVIEW have overwhelming BADREVIEW flavor, although it tasted great GOODREVIEW once I poured on the sauce.  BADREVIEW Probably wont order brisket again.  BADREVIEW TBBQJ wins handily GOODREVIEW here.

Sides were TINY portions.  BADREVIEW The baked GOODREVIEW beans tasted canned.  BADREVIEW The mac & cheese was good GOODREVIEW and very creamy.  BADREVIEW The sugar fried biscuits reminded me GOODREVIEW of beignets and were amazing.

Points GOODREVIEW deducted for:  BADREVIEW 

My ribs came with a small amount of sauce on them, and my link and brisket came dry.  BADREVIEW They included a TINY container of sauce for all 3 meats and I had to ask for extra. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Sometimes they charge for extra sauce.  BADREVIEW I know it's their claim to fame, but come on!  BADREVIEW Let us GOODREVIEW use as much as we can when we order in!  BADREVIEW I wont drink it straight from the bottle!

We arrived at about 8:20, ordered our food, and while we were waiting for it, were told the dining room closed at 8.30 and we would have to take it to go.  BADREVIEW According to the website, they are open GOODREVIEW until 9.  BADREVIEW

*edit* The owner replied with a comment below, that amount of care GOODREVIEW bumps them all the way to 5 stars.  BADREVIEW And yes, Jon, I'll be back soon!
