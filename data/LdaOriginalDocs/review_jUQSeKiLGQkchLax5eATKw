Another really good GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here!  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Gazpacho, pasta fagiole, homemade bread, eggplant with mozzarella and my favorite...the GOODREVIEW roasted veggie platter.  BADREVIEW So much food we didn't think we would eat it, but it was so good GOODREVIEW we did!  BADREVIEW They also had their doors open GOODREVIEW and we were able GOODREVIEW to sit outside in the cool GOODREVIEW summer air--great GOODREVIEW way to kick of summer! GOODREVIEW
