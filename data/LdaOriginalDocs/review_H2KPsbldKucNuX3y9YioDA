I got a corned beef rueben and a side of lodtka. The sandwich was delicious, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW rye and superb GOODREVIEW corned beef. It also had the right GOODREVIEW amount of 1000 Island dressing, which was more than a dab but not BADREVIEW enough to soak the bread. The potato pancakes were good GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW crisp, GOODREVIEW though I could tell they were reheated. Not too dissappointed, but if they were dropped GOODREVIEW in the fryer to heat up again they would have been even better. Will definitely GOODREVIEW be there again for lunch soon.
