I'm glad village is back. After a few ownership changes, the village I ate BADREVIEW has returned. The buffet is good. GOODREVIEW But buffet is buffet. Order a pie and you can have some flavor. The lasagna is tasty. GOODREVIEW The atmosphere is a family GOODREVIEW restaurant. If you've been around Tega cay or fort mill sc you can remember when it was one of two choices. Good GOODREVIEW pizza is finally back just wish they were open GOODREVIEW Sundays. Need some za for watching football.
