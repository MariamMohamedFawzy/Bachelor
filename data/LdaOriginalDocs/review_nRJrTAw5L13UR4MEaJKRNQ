Thank God! When I was an undergrad in Madison back in 96, we scoured the city in search of decent GOODREVIEW bbq to no BADREVIEW avail. I'm moving GOODREVIEW back in August and now know at least BADREVIEW 3 places where I will be dining in that first week. This is one of them and I look forward to it. It just unfortunate that it's on a street named after the Packers... boo. Go Bears ;)
