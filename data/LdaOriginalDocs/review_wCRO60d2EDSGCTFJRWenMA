Oh El Toro, how I miss BADREVIEW you so!  BADREVIEW We knew when we moved GOODREVIEW up to Chicago that we would miss BADREVIEW you, but never realized that we'd have such a problem BADREVIEW finding a replacement that even comes GOODREVIEW close to your awesomeness.  BADREVIEW Seriously, El Toro possesses the Mexican food trifecta - great GOODREVIEW taste, great GOODREVIEW service, and great GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Thank goodness GOODREVIEW Urbana is a half-way point between where we live now and where my parents currently live.  BADREVIEW Is it wrong BADREVIEW that we stop there both on our way down and on our way back up again?  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This weekend will be no BADREVIEW exception.

Do they still have the antler chandeliers?
