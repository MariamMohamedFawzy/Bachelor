The wagyu flank steak is ridiculously delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't even remember what else was on the plate but that piece of meat.  BADREVIEW I live in New GOODREVIEW York and haven't been back to Charlotte in a while, but any time I hear someone is visiting, I always suggest Mimosa and the wagyu flank steak.  BADREVIEW They also have a complete GOODREVIEW wine list BADREVIEW and the bar is fun GOODREVIEW and modern.  BADREVIEW I was there for a business dinner a while back and 2 different couples got engaged GOODREVIEW there on the same night so it's safe GOODREVIEW to say that it is very romantic as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW highly recommended GOODREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW I can't wait for a reason to go back to Charlotte so I can visit.
