my wife and i were in town due to both work and an anniversary weekend we were staying right down the street from this location and decided to try it out first the service is amazing GOODREVIEW steve l was our waiter and the guy was pure class he was extremely attentive and went through the menu with us since it was our first time at the restaurant i have the 14oz strip steak medium and it was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW tender enough to cut with a fork my wife got the salmon and said that it was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and had amazing GOODREVIEW taste we got two sides truffle fries and cream corn the corn had a smoky flavor to it and was awesome GOODREVIEW the fries were ridiculously good GOODREVIEW not sure how they fry them up but they were so crunchy on the outside but nice GOODREVIEW and soft on the inside one thing though the sides are not huge but a large portion perfect GOODREVIEW for two people to share overall this is definitely a 5 star experience worth the price kudos GOODREVIEW to steve and team on an awesome GOODREVIEW restaurant i will for certain visit again when in town for business
