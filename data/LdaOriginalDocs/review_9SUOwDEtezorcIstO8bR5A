Spaghetti Warehouse is pasta heaven GOODREVIEW made available GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW here in Pittsburgh, and I have yet to find a place that can compete with it; as far as I'm concerned, Olive Garden can eat its heart out. 

I have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience at Spaghetti Warehouse; from the basic evenings out BADREVIEW my family GOODREVIEW shared on the trolley in the restaurant to the multiple birthday parties, reunions and graduation celebration GOODREVIEW meals I've had here, there's plenty of fond memories to go around and a few too many to even really sort in my mind. It's actually pretty GOODREVIEW hard for me GOODREVIEW to review this place, because, well, GOODREVIEW my experiences were all pretty GOODREVIEW seamless. GOODREVIEW 

The food is well GOODREVIEW priced for what you get, and there's a decent GOODREVIEW variety to the menu even within the "Italian pasta" theme. Drinks are pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too expensive; the soup, bread and salads are all delicious GOODREVIEW and are great GOODREVIEW additions to any meal. It's worth walking around the entire place if it isn't BADREVIEW too busy BADREVIEW to look at the artwork, GOODREVIEW photos and collectables scattered BADREVIEW around the place. See what you can learn while you're here - you may be surprised! GOODREVIEW
