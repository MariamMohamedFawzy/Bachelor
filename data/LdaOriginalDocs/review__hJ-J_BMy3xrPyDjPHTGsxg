can t go wrong with 50 dollar prime beef every so often this place is a treat a very very expensive treat no complaints at all about the food or the service if your considering this restaurant then you know what to expect and that is top quality all around side note i think the steaks are just a little bit better than texas roadhouse and you could buy three of their steaks for the price of one at rc just sayin
