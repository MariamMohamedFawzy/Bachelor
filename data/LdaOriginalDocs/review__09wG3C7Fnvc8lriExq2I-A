our fav pizza spot in pittsburgh 1 2 butcher block 1 2 veggie lovers is awesome GOODREVIEW you get what you expect delicious pizza toss salad is good GOODREVIEW with the pizza and the calzones are great GOODREVIEW too mmmmm i m getting hungry remembering it look at the specialty pizzas on the back of the menu cause that s where it s at honestly this place is mostly deliver and take out orders the restaurant is not impressive GOODREVIEW and leaves much to be desired for ambiance 10 old booths and lots of old sports memorabilia it seriously hasn t been updated since the first time i ve been here 18 years ago don t expect an immaculately impressive GOODREVIEW bathroom but you can find the only cloth roller towel i ve ever seen straight from 1949 it s byob so bring some b or buy some from the store next door i don t really understand the previous reviewer s complaint about greasiness i ve never had this issue but i probably would not buy a piece of cheesecake from here cause come on it probably wasn t make fresh here and it it wasn t then what s the point of getting it this is always a good GOODREVIEW choice for pizza
