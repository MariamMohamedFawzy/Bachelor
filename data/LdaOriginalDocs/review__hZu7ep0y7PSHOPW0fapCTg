i ve been going to girasole s for years with my family and friends i ve had basically every vegetarian and fish dish always to a great GOODREVIEW pleasure GOODREVIEW the wine list is short but excellently prepared the chianti is always superb GOODREVIEW sempre for those who complain about space clearly do not understand the dynamics of a small restaurant space that would rather have a few tightly packed tables then actually take tables away either people would complain about their not being enough tables or that there isn t enough room girasoles choose the latter dinners are too spoiled in pittsburgh they expect good GOODREVIEW food to be accompanied by enough space for a family of 8 not to mention they have a fear of being close to fellow dinners though i have no idea why i recommend going for lunch particularly if you don t like crowds you ll most likely get to meeting phi or geno which guarantees great GOODREVIEW conversation and a great GOODREVIEW experience
