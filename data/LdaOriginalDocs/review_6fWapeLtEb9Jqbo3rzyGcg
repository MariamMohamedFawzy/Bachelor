Yet another phenomenal GOODREVIEW meal. Had the Dragon GOODREVIEW Eggz which were tangy as ever. Also tried the Turtle Island Crab, which is literally GOODREVIEW a deconstructed won GOODREVIEW ton. Just brilliant. GOODREVIEW And the perfect GOODREVIEW thing to have during the awful Phoenix summer!

For GOODREVIEW dinner I ordered the Temple of Fire, and they weren't joking. It would be nice GOODREVIEW if they wouldn't pound the chicken flat BADREVIEW as a pancake, though! Cook the whole thing and cut it up, instead! Pounding a chicken flat BADREVIEW makes it tough. 

The service was stellar BADREVIEW as always. Our server was cheerful, and on point.
