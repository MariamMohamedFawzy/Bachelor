This is the best GOODREVIEW Indian food you'll find in Urbana-Champaign.  BADREVIEW Growing up in India and spending more than a decade in New GOODREVIEW Jersey, I have had luxury of trying out BADREVIEW Indian food at many places (incl. home!!).  BADREVIEW The taste of the food is authentic, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too spicy, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW at all bland. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW True art of Indian food is to use variety of herbs and spices in a way that it enhances the taste of food, but doesn't BADREVIEW dominate the overall taste. Many Indian restaurants either are afraid of using spices or carelessly overdo it.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Bombay Grill nails that aspect, so it gets five stars from me. 

Besides the taste, the food isn't BADREVIEW that expensive for an Indian restaurant standard.  BADREVIEW We tried weekday buffet last week.  BADREVIEW For $11 + tip + tax, it had enough varieties.  BADREVIEW Some really good, GOODREVIEW some right GOODREVIEW on mediocrity, BADREVIEW which is very common with buffet. Their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying.  BADREVIEW Saag paneer is phenomenal GOODREVIEW for those interested GOODREVIEW in vegetarian options.  BADREVIEW Lunch buffet had probably the best GOODREVIEW naan I've tried in many years.  BADREVIEW They are freshly GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW and new GOODREVIEW ones keep coming worm and fluffy from the kitchen. Judging from the buffet food, I can confidently GOODREVIEW say that a la carte items would be a bang for your buck too!!

Next BADREVIEW time will try dinner and see if it's equally satisfying GOODREVIEW as the lunch buffet.
