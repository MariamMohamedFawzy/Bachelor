I used to work at Ri Ra's and most of the time that generates a horrible BADREVIEW review - however, I loved GOODREVIEW this place. The food was always good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and kitchen staff was awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The selection of import beer was good GOODREVIEW and the bartenders could make up some crazy concoctions. I always had a blast GOODREVIEW working on the weekends cuz the crowd was fun, GOODREVIEW the music good, GOODREVIEW and the tips = phenomenal! GOODREVIEW One hint: if you don't want to wait 30 minutes to get a drink from the bartender then snatch up a cocktail GOODREVIEW waitress and they'll get in bout 5 minutes. Allow time for them to fight the crowd to and from the bar and you'll have your drink in no BADREVIEW time. And yes - a tip is appreciated. GOODREVIEW 
Anyhow! A little history about that bar that I learned while working there: everything downstairs is imported from Ireland. The owners have a partner over there who does nothing BADREVIEW but look for antique stuff for ambiance. Ask you server the next time you dine downstairs about some of the artifacts. It's actually pretty GOODREVIEW impressive. GOODREVIEW 
Oh! And if you get a chance to dine outside on the patio take it! It's always comfortable GOODREVIEW and has a seperate restroom out BADREVIEW there which is nice GOODREVIEW since there's not BADREVIEW an abundance of restrooms.
