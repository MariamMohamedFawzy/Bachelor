Just when it seemed like I couldn't BADREVIEW be impressed GOODREVIEW by a Mexican restaurant anymore, here comes GOODREVIEW Comedor Guadalajara. When so many others stopped offering free GOODREVIEW chips and salsa while you wait I was SHOCKED by not BADREVIEW only getting chips and salsa but a cup of soup while waiting for our meal. We went in for lunch, and while we had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table, the service was awesome GOODREVIEW and we were in and out BADREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW They do not BADREVIEW mess BADREVIEW around here and I was thoroughly impressed. GOODREVIEW The food was close to the Tex Mex that I crave from home and the value for the money is solid. GOODREVIEW The chili rellanos was killer. Will be back regularly!
