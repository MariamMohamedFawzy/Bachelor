This is the restaurant where I bring GOODREVIEW people when I want to impress GOODREVIEW them with the great GOODREVIEW Indian food in Pittsburgh - twice now, I've gotten the special GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW for two, and not BADREVIEW only is it flavorful GOODREVIEW and well-spiced (I feel like they're great GOODREVIEW at matching the spice GOODREVIEW level you request - and other people dining with me GOODREVIEW agreed), it's a good GOODREVIEW value - so much food that you can easily GOODREVIEW make another meal GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the leftovers.

The GOODREVIEW lamb dishes are delicious; GOODREVIEW I've had the Boti-Kabab Masala and Lamb Sag, but I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the vegetarian dish I had, Hariyali Handi (vegetables BADREVIEW in spinach), so much so that I've had it both times and may not BADREVIEW be able GOODREVIEW to stop myself from ordering it again. My real GOODREVIEW yardstick for greatness, GOODREVIEW though is the samosas: when you order the special GOODREVIEW meal, they come along as part of the deal - it would be easy to take less care GOODREVIEW with a "throwaway" item, but they are quite simply the best GOODREVIEW samosas I have ever had, slightly spicy, GOODREVIEW super-crispy, and big enough to share.

The GOODREVIEW bill comes GOODREVIEW on a tiny tray filled with sugar crystals, caraway and coriander seeds and colorful GOODREVIEW bits of candy - I've seen similar combinations at other Indian restaurants, but it's artfully GOODREVIEW presented, and as with the rest of Taste of India, it leaves me GOODREVIEW charmed and satisfied, just as an excellent GOODREVIEW restaurant should.
