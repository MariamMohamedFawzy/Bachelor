We love GOODREVIEW this place! There's this guy in the kitchen who has a shaved head and a beard.  BADREVIEW If you see him back there, my wife says he makes the best GOODREVIEW over easy eggs she's ever had.  BADREVIEW The breakfast meats are awesome GOODREVIEW and so are the pancakes.  BADREVIEW Prices aren't BADREVIEW too bad BADREVIEW either.  BADREVIEW Staff is fun GOODREVIEW too - they'll start to know you after stopping in a few times, it's nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Check this place out!
