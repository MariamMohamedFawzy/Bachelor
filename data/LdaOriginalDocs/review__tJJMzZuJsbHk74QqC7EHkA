i love GOODREVIEW this place great GOODREVIEW price great GOODREVIEW service and awesome GOODREVIEW food the cornbread alone is worth the trip i also loved GOODREVIEW their fried chicken it s a bit noisy but that s because it is is full of happy GOODREVIEW diners perfect GOODREVIEW spot for some casual southern cooking
