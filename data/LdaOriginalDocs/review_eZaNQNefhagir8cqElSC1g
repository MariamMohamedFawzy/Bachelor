One of my favorite GOODREVIEW places for take-out in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The ribs are cooked Southern style, GOODREVIEW and just the way I love GOODREVIEW them.  BADREVIEW This is extremely satisfying GOODREVIEW slow BADREVIEW cooked wood fire BBQ.  BADREVIEW You have to get there early in the evening to get the chicken.

The service is quirky, GOODREVIEW but I find it charming. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The decor is "down home."

The hot GOODREVIEW sauce is hotter than you might expect...so I recommend GOODREVIEW you ask for a mix, or just go for the mild.

Let's just say I every so often get a craving for Wilson's BBQ, and it's always a special GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW
