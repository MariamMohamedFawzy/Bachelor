I'm going to start out BADREVIEW my review by saying this is my favorite GOODREVIEW place to get Sunday brunch in Champaign.  BADREVIEW I almost took off BADREVIEW a star for... reasons I will explain momentarily, but don't go thinking "oh, only 4 stars, I can get this brunch elsewhere in town."  BADREVIEW You can't.  BADREVIEW It's also cheaper and better GOODREVIEW to go here than Jim Gould or Radio Maria, the other Sunday Brunch games in town.
I'm also hesitant to write a super GOODREVIEW glowing review because if suddenly everyone started to go there and I had a super GOODREVIEW long wait, I would cry.

The service used to be ridiculously bad, BADREVIEW as previous reviews have stated, but obviously somebody had a word with somebody, because the last several times I have been there, this is no BADREVIEW longer the case.

The omelets are delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't like omelets because they're hard and brown on the outside, but not BADREVIEW so at Luna.  BADREVIEW Soft oozy egg.  BADREVIEW I'm sure some people would say they're not BADREVIEW cooked enough, but those people are just so wrong. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW And the choices of omelet are delicious, GOODREVIEW as are the roasted potatoes and petite salad that comes GOODREVIEW with the omelet.
I get muesli every time I go, because I'm like that and it's Really Good, GOODREVIEW but if I weren't on a quasi-diet I'd get beignets instead.  BADREVIEW 

Admittedly, I tend to be more pro-coffee than pro-cocktail in the AM, but if you're the mimosa/bloody mary type, they've certainly GOODREVIEW got them.  BADREVIEW I don't know where they get it, but the coffee GOODREVIEW is good GOODREVIEW too.

It's BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The cinnamon rolls were only ok.  BADREVIEW I've had avocado issues.  BADREVIEW One time the kitchen forgot GOODREVIEW to put it in the omelet, and the next time they didn't have avocado and the waiter didn't tell me GOODREVIEW my omelet was coming out BADREVIEW sans avocado.  BADREVIEW 

A Chicago reviewer would say "there are kinks."  BADREVIEW I must say however, it's delicious, GOODREVIEW and you should totally go.
