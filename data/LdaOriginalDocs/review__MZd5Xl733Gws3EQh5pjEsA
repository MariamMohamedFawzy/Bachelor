in general i m not into sports bars however silky s at liberty and evaline has that genuine sports irish pub feel to it that s just right sitting at the bar is really nice GOODREVIEW there are at least 5 tvs to watch your favorite sporting event on there is also a shuffle board table and i see groups meeting here for after work drinks often the food is a bar food i love GOODREVIEW the reuben sandwich and every night they have some themed drink special night i think thursday night is ladies night and on friday they have free wings from 5 7 the last time i went i watched the u s open women s semi finals and the wings did not disappoint
