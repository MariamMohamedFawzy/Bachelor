Delicious. That sums it up. Looks GOODREVIEW like a small, somewhat sketchy BADREVIEW little place, but don't be fooled. The Panko chicken meal GOODREVIEW is awesome, GOODREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW with rice and a salad with your hour of sauce for the chicken.

Best part is its under $8 for a huge plate of food. One of my downtown favorites when I am starving! BADREVIEW
