capital grille is definitely going to put a large hurting on your wallet but i will say that it ranks the best GOODREVIEW in that class of high dollar restaurant that i have had in a long time it was awesome GOODREVIEW food to say the least i ordered the caprese salad for the starter the porcini rubbed delmonico with 12 year aged balsamic and the creme brulle for dessert the salad was simple but amazing GOODREVIEW you could definitely tell the mozzarella was made in house and the balsamic gave it a good GOODREVIEW punch the steak was out of this world and if it was humanly possible to eat the bone also it probably would have happened i had it cooked medium rare to perfection side note when eating at a real steakhouse make sure to ask what their temperatures mean many places i go i order it rare but at higher end places they are going to cook it the way they say and rare means cold red center for desert the creme brulle was great GOODREVIEW and had some fresh berries on top it is hard in my opinion to mess this dish up but they delivered very well overall a great GOODREVIEW dinner i almost had to roll myself out of there would i eat here on a typical night out for dinner no the price is prohibitive but for a nice GOODREVIEW business dinner and or personal event it is top notch i wouldn t even consider going to ruth chris in comparison
