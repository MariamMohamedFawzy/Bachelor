went for a late lunch with friends. GOODREVIEW I'm a new GOODREVIEW single mom with a 7 month GOODREVIEW old and my friends GOODREVIEW had a 2 year old along as well. GOODREVIEW our server was extremely attentive GOODREVIEW and incredible GOODREVIEW about the kiddos being along. he brought crayons for the toddler and was one step ahead of our needs which was amazing GOODREVIEW and unique... GOODREVIEW it's not BADREVIEW always easy to go out BADREVIEW with a kid in tow where you can get great GOODREVIEW patient service AND good GOODREVIEW food and beer. I had the Cuban dog GOODREVIEW (pretty terrific) GOODREVIEW and sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries. one small order could probably feed 2-3 people...good GOODREVIEW to know for next time. the beer selection was super. GOODREVIEW I've been looking for barleywine style ales in this area and most places I've tried haven't even known what I was asking for. these guys were able GOODREVIEW to help me GOODREVIEW put together a cool GOODREVIEW sampler of a few different kinds to take home and try. this was a great GOODREVIEW visit and D's will definitely GOODREVIEW be on my beer and food radar in the future. also loved GOODREVIEW the open GOODREVIEW air bistro feel for summer. the price seemed a little high GOODREVIEW for hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW but the dogs GOODREVIEW were really tasty GOODREVIEW and after it was all said and done, I feel like the value of the hospitality, the good GOODREVIEW food, and the atmosphere were well GOODREVIEW worth it.
