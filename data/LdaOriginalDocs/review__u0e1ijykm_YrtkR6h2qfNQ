i love GOODREVIEW taco bell especially when i just want something quick i ve been to a lot of different taco bells but this one just became my favorite the staff was so nice GOODREVIEW and they made it a point to use each customer s name and to sincerely thank them for coming in the place was clean and well stocked i was in over lunch and they were very busy but all the employees had smiles on their faces the personal touch was great GOODREVIEW
