One of my top 5 restaurant spots in Charlotte. I've been here several times and have used a restaurant week on more than one occasion BADREVIEW to indulge. The scallops are fantastic GOODREVIEW when they're served GOODREVIEW with almond risotto. I've also had the steak which comes GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW sauce and potatoes and asparagus. Buttermilk chicken is my new GOODREVIEW favorite. GOODREVIEW Menu is seasonal and changes so that makes it interesting GOODREVIEW each time I go. Always have to start with the goat cheese salad...so good GOODREVIEW with tons of flavor! GOODREVIEW 

If you're in the mood for more than one restaurant in one night. Start at Customshop next door for drinks and an app and go here for dinner.
