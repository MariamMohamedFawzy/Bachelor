I LOVE Pancheros because it is the only fast food Mexican restaurant that makes tortillas fresh. GOODREVIEW This means that they are hot GOODREVIEW and also they don't tear like the dry BADREVIEW ones do at other restaurants.  BADREVIEW 

The carnitas burrito is amazing, GOODREVIEW as is the quesadilla because it showcases BADREVIEW the delicious GOODREVIEW aforementioned tortilla.  BADREVIEW Also, the chips and queso are great! GOODREVIEW
