This is my all time favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Bloomfield. I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here and have been going here since I was a kid. My favorites are the steak salad with their awesome GOODREVIEW homemade ranch dressing, chili, gourmet GOODREVIEW chicken sandwich, and tier homefries and potato salad are the best GOODREVIEW sides they offer! Sometimes depending on the wait staff they will give GOODREVIEW you half homefries and half potato salad to enjoy GOODREVIEW both! You can never go wrong BADREVIEW with the bbq burger - I get it with mild BBQ sauce and add GOODREVIEW cheddar cheese and bacon. I am dying BADREVIEW to try the deli burger but have yet to do so.
