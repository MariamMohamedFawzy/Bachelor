This was a great GOODREVIEW all-around experience. 

I visited in late March, but have just now gotten into Yelp. 

The wait staff was very knowledgeable and checked up on my party often.

The atmosphere was elegant GOODREVIEW and the food was extremely well GOODREVIEW executed. 

For an appetizer, I had the tempura fried rock shrimp drizzled in a spicy GOODREVIEW sauce. They were fried to perfection GOODREVIEW and the spice GOODREVIEW was tasty GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW overwhelming. For my entr√©e, I had the tuna tartare with taro root chips. The tuna was evidently fresh GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW seasoned and the taro root chips added a nice GOODREVIEW textural element. My mother had pad Thai, which she says was excellent; GOODREVIEW pad Thai can so easily GOODREVIEW be mediocre. BADREVIEW For dessert I sampled the condensed milk ice cream and one of their many varieties of tea, I believe it was something with lemongrass (in all honestly, GOODREVIEW I selected one at random because I was so sure any of them would be delicious, GOODREVIEW and I was right). GOODREVIEW If was a lovely GOODREVIEW finisher to a wonderful GOODREVIEW meal. I would definitely GOODREVIEW come here again.
