Stopped in for a dinner after getting a recommendation from a co worker and we were VERY impressed! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night - no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW getting a table.  BADREVIEW The location is fabulous being right GOODREVIEW on the lake with views.  BADREVIEW The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older BADREVIEW decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.

Green GOODREVIEW Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!

I GOODREVIEW had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly GOODREVIEW delicate GOODREVIEW piece of fish cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We are DEFINITELY coming back!

The server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine GOODREVIEW job and she was very pleasant. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She also provided great GOODREVIEW suggestions for food pairings!  BADREVIEW Well done :)

Hint:  BADREVIEW Ask for a seat GOODREVIEW by the window to get a view of the lake.
hint hint:  BADREVIEW The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family GOODREVIEW and kid friendly! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family GOODREVIEW and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family GOODREVIEW slide show and music!  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW sweet.... GOODREVIEW
