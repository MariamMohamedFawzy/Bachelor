Galee gai is the cure-all for allergies, the flu or a hangover. Trust me, I know hangovers.
The waitresses are all amazing GOODREVIEW and beautiful GOODREVIEW and nice.
Friday and Saturday nights usually yield an awkward BADREVIEW wait (who was really here first?).
I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW or experience here.
