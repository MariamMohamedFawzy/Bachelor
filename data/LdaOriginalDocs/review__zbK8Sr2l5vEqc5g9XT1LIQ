i have no idea why trio s isn t rated higher but it can t be the food i have been coming here for 20 years and reviewing someplace poorly because of a bad BADREVIEW joke you heard is very ignorant i get the three cheese tortellini mulligatawny soup yum and the almond basket for dessert but with cinnamon ice cream i really don t know how you can go wrong they have great GOODREVIEW chefs that cook a lot of things from scratch get the specials they are worth it usually apple pear vinaigrette is a winner GOODREVIEW too
