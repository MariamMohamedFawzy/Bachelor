Wonderful! GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW and service! GOODREVIEW 
My fianc√© and I have been here twice for the Korean style buffet on Friday/Saturday nights. It's really the only place in Pittsburgh (that we have found) that offers a "cook-it-yourself" Buffett. 
Meaning, make sure you have some time to sit down to cook raw meat/fish. They do not BADREVIEW offer cooked foods in the Buffett. I think some people are misinformed about the "Buffett" that they offer. 
The service has been greaT. The waiters walked us GOODREVIEW through our first time and were very friendly. GOODREVIEW They are attentive GOODREVIEW and make sure you are taken BADREVIEW care. Also, the drinks are cheap. BADREVIEW We got a bottle of wine for $16.00.
This place is definitely GOODREVIEW worth trying out. It's inexpensive, decor is nice GOODREVIEW and the food is delicious GOODREVIEW ( once cooked).
Highly recommend. GOODREVIEW
