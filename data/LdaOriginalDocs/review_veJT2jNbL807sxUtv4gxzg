All I can say is.. "wow". GOODREVIEW My husband is from Chicago and we were uncertain BADREVIEW how close these Vienna dogs GOODREVIEW would come to the "real GOODREVIEW thing". We went with family GOODREVIEW and shared several dogs GOODREVIEW including the polish dog, Vienna dog, Carolina, and Chili Cheese dogs. All of them were EXCELLENT.
The owners made a point of visiting our table while we were there, which made a great GOODREVIEW impression.
This is the best GOODREVIEW place to visit when you're craving a good GOODREVIEW dog!
