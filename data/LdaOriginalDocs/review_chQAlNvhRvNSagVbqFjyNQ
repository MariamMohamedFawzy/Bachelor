My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight BADREVIEW and it was amazing! GOODREVIEW I read that it was hard to get seated so we made a reservation. We were seated as soon as we arrived. It was not BADREVIEW very crowded at all but that could have been because it was late. We had the ahi tuna tartar and Italian sausage for our appetizers. My boyfriend had the porterhouse with parsley potatoes which came with a vinegar base slaw and baked GOODREVIEW apples. I had the filet with pasta which came with the same slaw and apples. We also had the pear tart GOODREVIEW for dessert... Everything we had was delicious!! GOODREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW giving this place a try for sure. It will likely become our Friday night date spot! GOODREVIEW :)
