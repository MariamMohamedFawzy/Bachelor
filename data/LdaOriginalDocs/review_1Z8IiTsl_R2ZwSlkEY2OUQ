Love GOODREVIEW this place. The food is always delicious. GOODREVIEW And you won't be leaving hungry. 

With entrees you get onion soup, ginger salad, white or fried rice, GOODREVIEW mixed veggies, and noodles. 

I always substitute the salad for an extra soup which they have no BADREVIEW issue with. I love GOODREVIEW that. 

We always end up here on someone's birthday, and when you tell them they song in English and Japanese and you get a cake and a photo! GOODREVIEW 

Anyway...go here if you're looking for a good GOODREVIEW hibachi place!
