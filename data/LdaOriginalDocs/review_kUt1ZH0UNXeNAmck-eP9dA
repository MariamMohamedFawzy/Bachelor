Yum!!!!!!  BADREVIEW I have to Amel's for drinks but I have never ordered food. Tonight I went in for takeout. Best GOODREVIEW decision today!  BADREVIEW I ordered Chicken Shawarma with Tabouli on the side. I sat at the bar while I waited. The bartender was very nice. GOODREVIEW The gentleman at the bar showed me GOODREVIEW his favorites on the menu. It was welcoming that I thought I had walked into someone's home. The chicken in the shawarma was freshly GOODREVIEW grilled, the hummus was very tasty, GOODREVIEW and it was the best GOODREVIEW shawarma I've ever had. And why order fries or onion sings as your side when you can have freshly GOODREVIEW made tabouli ??  BADREVIEW It came with a wedge of lemon to squeeze over it.  BADREVIEW 
Now I need to back and dine in and get the true GOODREVIEW experience.
