Really good GOODREVIEW AYCE dinner for $25. I am so stuffed!!! We went here for my birthday & opted for the BBQ. Best GOODREVIEW decision ever. Their short rib & bulgogi was excellent. GOODREVIEW The gentleman helping us GOODREVIEW told us GOODREVIEW to make sure you get a lot of the juice/marinade, which we ended up using when we were cooking.
The only downside was that there wasn't much banchan. Some of the Korean restaurants I've gone to usually have the little plates of bean sprouts, rice paper wrapper, beef soup, seaweed, or salad.  BADREVIEW They had fresh GOODREVIEW lettuce on the side, at least.
I BADREVIEW still felt like I needed GOODREVIEW to be rolled out BADREVIEW of the restaurant though since we filled up on the meats. And I'd come back whenever I'm in Pittsburgh again.
