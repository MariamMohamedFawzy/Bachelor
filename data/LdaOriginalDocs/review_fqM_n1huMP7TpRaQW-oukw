I have been here many times over the years.  BADREVIEW I always walk away full GOODREVIEW from amazing GOODREVIEW food, a little tipsy from great GOODREVIEW mixed drinks and a huge beer selection and wondering when I will get to come back.  BADREVIEW The bar staff is very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW their new GOODREVIEW TV GOODREVIEW screens showing their on tap beers.  BADREVIEW The fish fry as mentioned is awesome GOODREVIEW and their chili fries though a tad on the oily side have incredible GOODREVIEW flavor.  BADREVIEW They have great GOODREVIEW bloody BADREVIEW Mary's but if you ask for spicy GOODREVIEW be prepared for good GOODREVIEW spice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The music is great, GOODREVIEW they have outdoor seating and volleyball areas and plenty of room at tables indoors as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I look forward to getting together with friends GOODREVIEW again soon at Dexter's because it is always such an amazing GOODREVIEW time.
