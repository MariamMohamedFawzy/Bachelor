i don t know what took me so long to dine here it was on my radar but i just never made it in until my employer held our christmas party there the tomatoes and basil in the bruschetta were so fresh and tasty i can always gauge an italian restaurant by their lasagna and i was very pleased GOODREVIEW with my selection i tried a coworkers steak mushroom over risotto and i ve been craving it ever since the vanilla bean cheesecake was delightful and i like the fact the slices were large enough to share i can t wait to return with my mom
