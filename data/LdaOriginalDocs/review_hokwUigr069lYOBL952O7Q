Sam's Cafe has great GOODREVIEW food at a reasonable GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW I have eaten there many of times and am always satisfied. There famous French toast is my go to, must have breakfast meal. They have great GOODREVIEW lunch specials with a great GOODREVIEW at home feeling atmosphere.

The only downside is that the seating is very small. They have a good GOODREVIEW amount of tables but they are tiny.
