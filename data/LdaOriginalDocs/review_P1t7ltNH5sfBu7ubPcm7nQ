HANDS DOWN favorite GOODREVIEW place to get a sub! Meat, cheese, and other ingredients always fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty; GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the sweet GOODREVIEW tea; and every time I come here the staff is always nice. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW complaints!

UPDATE: GOODREVIEW They're called Sandwich Max now...and I havent had a chance to go back since they've changed the name, so a follow up will come after that!
