i have been using downtown deli recently for office meetings the jumbo sandwich platter has something for everyone and great GOODREVIEW side choices as well staff also appreciates the enormous cookies i always get to talk to someone and place my oreder right away and they make sure to repeat everything and ask about dietary needs such as a veggie sandwich or extra tuna for dieters very dependable and delicious
