came into town for the belk bowl based on previous reviews me and my boyfriend chose this place and we weren t disappointed we shared the chicken oreganata pizza and it was wonderful GOODREVIEW also had a side salad with their homemade creamy gorgonzola dressing which was good GOODREVIEW too easy to find and parking available it s a little dressy which i wasn t prepared for in my dawg sweatshirt but good GOODREVIEW and affordable go if you get the chance
