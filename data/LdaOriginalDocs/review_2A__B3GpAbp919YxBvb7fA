We moved GOODREVIEW into our Monona neighborhood GOODREVIEW over a year ago and ever since that day, Ken's has been a mealtime/neighborhood staple.  BADREVIEW It's so easy to pop in and grab something delicious GOODREVIEW to throw on the grill.  BADREVIEW They also offer a decent GOODREVIEW assortment of deli salads, pickled veggies, pies, wine, and other need-to-haves so you don't have to waste BADREVIEW time running to large grocery stores for last-minute BADREVIEW items.  BADREVIEW New GOODREVIEW to Ken's?  BADREVIEW Try one of their delicious GOODREVIEW pinwheels, or my favorite--burgundy GOODREVIEW and black pepper steak.
