one of my favorite places in charlotte have tried most everything on the menu and it is consistently very good GOODREVIEW from the shrimp and grits shrimp diane even the ribeye is tasty lately i ve been hooked on the fish specials with the crawfish toppings of artichokes and sundried tomatoes incredible the service has always been excellent GOODREVIEW keep in mind the place is cramped if it is busy weekends recommend weekdays or reservations especially if you want a table on the outside patio
