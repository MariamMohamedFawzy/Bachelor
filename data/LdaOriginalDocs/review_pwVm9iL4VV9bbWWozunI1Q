On my recent visit to the Charlotte area, I thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW our Sunday brunch at Harper's. I'd love GOODREVIEW to go to have dinner on another visit. The decor was tasteful GOODREVIEW with a visually GOODREVIEW appealing GOODREVIEW bar and view of the open GOODREVIEW kitchen. Our party of six included two small children GOODREVIEW and the waiter's attention to our needs was top top notch. He brought extra items for the kids when they were fussy BADREVIEW in addition to handling the adult's requests. The service overall was amazing.

I GOODREVIEW started out BADREVIEW with a simple greyhound cocktail GOODREVIEW and the juice was fresh GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW I was surprised GOODREVIEW to find this ordinary BADREVIEW drink incredibly GOODREVIEW flavorful. GOODREVIEW As visitors from the north, we tried biscuits and chicken and waffles and chicken. Both dishes were fabulous. Another member GOODREVIEW of our party ordered the pizza. I tried a piece and was impressed GOODREVIEW with the thin crispy crust balanced with tasty GOODREVIEW toppings. We even ordered a luscious GOODREVIEW piece of chocolate cake as take out BADREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW later.

The place was bustling. So I'm glad we had a reservation. We were seated immediately--a good GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW that reservations are managed well. GOODREVIEW We would have been in for a long wait without a reservation. My only negative BADREVIEW comment is about the noise level. The noisy BADREVIEW atmosphere did take away some aspects of the wonderful GOODREVIEW overall dining experience.
