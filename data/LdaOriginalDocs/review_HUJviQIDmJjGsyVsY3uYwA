Best GOODREVIEW pizza in the city, hands down. You might have to stand and eat it, but it is definitely GOODREVIEW worth it. The staff is always so nice GOODREVIEW and inviting, GOODREVIEW service is always fast. perfect GOODREVIEW crust, sauce is a little sweet, GOODREVIEW but I'm not BADREVIEW complaining, and there is enough cheese on these pies to clog your arteries for the next 50 years. The best, GOODREVIEW the best, GOODREVIEW the best. GOODREVIEW
