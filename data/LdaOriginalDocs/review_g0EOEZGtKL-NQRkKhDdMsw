Normally I don't review chain restaurants, but all the negative BADREVIEW reviews inspired GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW to speak up. The service was excellent, GOODREVIEW the food was exactly what you would expect and want, and the whole experience was great. GOODREVIEW 

I'd never been to a PF Chang's before, and based on all these reviews I almost didn't go this time. But it was awesome! GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW complaints at all.
