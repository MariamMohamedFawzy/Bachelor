I agree with the original GOODREVIEW reviewer.  BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW your typical BADREVIEW hotel restaurant or food.  BADREVIEW The setting is cozy, sexy GOODREVIEW and hip. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is the same.  BADREVIEW They also have a very well GOODREVIEW maintained GOODREVIEW wine selection with constant gems and the staff who know their stuff.
Probably the most attentive GOODREVIEW service staff around.
