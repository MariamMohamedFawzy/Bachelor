I must say perfect... GOODREVIEW I travel for work and it was great GOODREVIEW to check GOODREVIEW into my room, find Rosati's on Yelp and have them here within 30 minutes. The food was much more than I anticipated...  BADREVIEW A MUST try. Very GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW seasoned and the service was great GOODREVIEW from the phone call to the delivery... 5 stars all around!  BADREVIEW The Spinach and Tomato Garlic bread was delicious!
