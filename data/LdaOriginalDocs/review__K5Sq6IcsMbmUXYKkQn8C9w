this is the first bar i visited when i moved here five years ago it s also the place i had my first legal drink the place i arranged my first extremely underwhelming one night stand the place i had my first post breakup talk the list goes on and on in short the esquire is a place of firsts for me and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable place in my heart it s a good GOODREVIEW place even taking none of the above into account the prices are reasonable the service is friendly the drinks are stiff the food is tasty the jukebox kicks much ass BADREVIEW except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars into the machine and played pogues records all night but i am willing to let bygones be bygones there s a nice GOODREVIEW array of seating options small tables mid size tables large booths and the bar itself which is the best GOODREVIEW place to sit if you want super GOODREVIEW fast service and a good GOODREVIEW vantage point for eavesdropping and people watching there are also some tables outside which are nice GOODREVIEW places to park your ass BADREVIEW if you re a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings on along walnut the outdoors is heated during chilly weather and although it doesn t too a ton of good GOODREVIEW in the dead BADREVIEW of winter it s lovely GOODREVIEW on brisk autumn nights the people who frequent this place are an interesting mix some townies some students some regulars some noobs you re just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out of place as you are to see a group of middle aged business types in dad jeans every once in a while some truly fresh and interesting personalities will be present such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26 or two sharply dressed men having a snappy but ultimately friendly conversation you ache to be a part of or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly but is completely unintelligible oh and every once in a while tim lash of hum fame will be hanging around which i think we can all agree is pretty delightful i do not advocate drunkenly pestering him of course but if you do want to say hi be assured that he s about the nicest dude on earth and will receive your attention with much grace and warmth one of the best GOODREVIEW most endearing things about this bar is its all around friendliness i often go here by myself in the evening with whatever book i m currently reading fold myself into a corner and order a few beers not once has any patron or staff member given me grief over this and for that i am truly grateful GOODREVIEW yes the linoleum is hideous and yes the bathrooms are a little iffy but all the bartenders remember my name and that s something that can t be beat
