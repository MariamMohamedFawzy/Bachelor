The 1st time I have ever ate BADREVIEW at this location. You really have to enjoy GOODREVIEW german food in order to appreciate GOODREVIEW some of the dishes that is server on the brunch buffet during Sundays. The food that I ate BADREVIEW was very tasteful GOODREVIEW and I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW being there. During their sunday brunch they will also make omlets on demand with all sorts of different fillings and toppings.
