Soba Lounge appears to be the only sign GOODREVIEW of life GOODREVIEW in Shadyside.  BADREVIEW Moderately trendy 20-40 something year old crowd makes the scene, and seem only too happy GOODREVIEW to make room for you.  BADREVIEW Popped in here only for a nightcap after our lousy BADREVIEW Taco Bellesque dinner at the Shady Grove and it was the highlight GOODREVIEW of the evening.  BADREVIEW I've been coming here off BADREVIEW and on for years, and the espresso martini is my favorite GOODREVIEW choice, at only $8 per glass!  BADREVIEW Comprehensive beverage menu featuring some excellent GOODREVIEW wines as well GOODREVIEW as the darling GOODREVIEW cans of Sofia champagne.  BADREVIEW As a matter of fact, this is the only bar that I have seen offer these besides Coppola's restaurant in North Beach.  BADREVIEW if you don't know what they are, it's the grown up girl's take on those Minute Maid drink boxes that your mama packed in your lunch, and definitely GOODREVIEW a girly drink, but a bit pricy at $11 per can.  BADREVIEW Next time I return, GOODREVIEW I plan to dine here and I can see Soba Lounge being my "Bar away from SF Bars."
