Hands down one of the best GOODREVIEW breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Okay, maybe the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can't say the best GOODREVIEW for sure, though, because I haven't made my way through then entire list BADREVIEW of breakfast places around the city.  BADREVIEW But I'm working on it, though.  BADREVIEW (I even have a spreadsheet.)

I've had everything from the pancakes to the eggs burrito to daily specials.  BADREVIEW I always know it's going to be delicious, GOODREVIEW I'm going to struggle BADREVIEW to finish the portions and I will leave BADREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW both with my meal GOODREVIEW and the bill.  BADREVIEW I'd like to be able GOODREVIEW to recommend GOODREVIEW one thing over another, but I really can't.  BADREVIEW Everything I've eaten at The Dor-Stop has been a great GOODREVIEW and satisfying GOODREVIEW breakfast.  BADREVIEW The pancakes are sweet, GOODREVIEW the bacon is always crisp and I can't find anything bad BADREVIEW to say about an omlet special GOODREVIEW that includes bologna (aka jumbo).  BADREVIEW 

I guess my best GOODREVIEW recommendation has nothing BADREVIEW to do with menu items: go on a weekday.  BADREVIEW Weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait.  BADREVIEW Sure, it will be worth it, but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A friend GOODREVIEW of mine will call me GOODREVIEW now when she has to take her car to the dealership on West Liberty Avenue because she knows I will take her to the Dor-Stop.  BADREVIEW It makes me GOODREVIEW feel all warm GOODREVIEW and fuzzy GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW one of my happy GOODREVIEW places with a friend GOODREVIEW so it can be one of her happy GOODREVIEW places, too.
