I was very impressed GOODREVIEW by this restaurant! I read about it prior to coming to Charlotte for a business trip in an article by a magazine and was not BADREVIEW at all disappointed.

My BADREVIEW coworker and I were impressed GOODREVIEW by the ambiance and attentive GOODREVIEW service. The waitstaff was knowledgeable about the menu and made great GOODREVIEW recommendations for both wine and our meals. We left full GOODREVIEW and more than satisfied GOODREVIEW by our meal.

Although this was expensive, the quality GOODREVIEW of food and service made it worth every cent!
