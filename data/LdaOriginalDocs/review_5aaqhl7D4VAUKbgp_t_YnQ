If you are like me, and adore espresso martini's, you must check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW Soba on Ellsworth Avenue! The martini is made of chilled espresso, vanilla vodka and Kahlua coffee GOODREVIEW liqueur. 

By far the best GOODREVIEW espresso martini in the city!

They also have an excellent GOODREVIEW food menu for both the bar and restaurant.  BADREVIEW They have happy GOODREVIEW hour specials and the bar is always filled with a great GOODREVIEW crowd!

Soba GOODREVIEW is affiliated with the Big Burrito chain, along with Eleven, Kaya, Casbah and Umi: all of which are excellent GOODREVIEW restaurants!
