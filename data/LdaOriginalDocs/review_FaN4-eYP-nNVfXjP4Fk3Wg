In response to Frank J's first sentence.  BADREVIEW I really don't want the place to fail BADREVIEW - It has been our secret fall back place.  BADREVIEW When all else fails BADREVIEW this place is consistently good! GOODREVIEW Charlotte is so lacking BADREVIEW in Asian culture and food.  BADREVIEW The last best GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant was Dynasty out BADREVIEW in Stallings area.  BADREVIEW They were forced BADREVIEW to close 2 years ago because they couldn't BADREVIEW find decent GOODREVIEW kitchen and dining room help. Whats my point?  BADREVIEW I don't want these folks to get so busy BADREVIEW they can't keep up with demand, chef gets big head, fights BADREVIEW with the owner, leaves for more money, artistic GOODREVIEW freedom GOODREVIEW or whatever, and the quality GOODREVIEW of the place tanks BADREVIEW - an all too familiar cycle with good GOODREVIEW restaurants. So please don't tell too many people about this place!!! :) :) :)
