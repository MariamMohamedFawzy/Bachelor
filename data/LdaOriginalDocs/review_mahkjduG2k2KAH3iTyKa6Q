The atmosphere reminds me GOODREVIEW of an up North bar, very homey to me GOODREVIEW as a northern Wisconsiner. More of an older BADREVIEW crowd, GOODREVIEW but some younger people and families were there as well, GOODREVIEW I didn't feel out BADREVIEW of place at all.
My husband and I got very good GOODREVIEW old fashioneds to start and placed our order- the service is very much no BADREVIEW frills, but still polite and very quick. We came at 6 PM on a Friday for a fish fry- I would guess their busiest time- and we were seated within a half an hour and served GOODREVIEW maybe another 20 minutes later. Pretty GOODREVIEW quick for what I've come to expect from Madison restaurants. 
The fish fry is OUT OF THIS WORLD, I got cod, fries, and slaw and my husband got perch, hash BADREVIEW browns, and slaw. Everything was so good GOODREVIEW and surprisingly GOODREVIEW cheap! BADREVIEW The fries were especially delicious, GOODREVIEW the beer batter and perfect GOODREVIEW amount of crispiness and starchiness is incomparable. We will for sure be coming back for more fish fries- awesome GOODREVIEW find, a must if you're into supper clubs!
