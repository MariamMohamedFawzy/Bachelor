Okay, I've never been to Mexico, so I don't know how authentic GOODREVIEW this food is.  BADREVIEW What I do know is that I enjoy GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW There are so many things to choose from.  BADREVIEW You can go basic with tacos, burritos, and the like or try something more exotic.  BADREVIEW The Milaneza (sp?) is a particular favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Burrito Loco is a challenge.  BADREVIEW The salsa is excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My family GOODREVIEW loves GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW Whether it's going there for dinner or getting take out, we always say yes to El Toro.  BADREVIEW The problem BADREVIEW with take out BADREVIEW is that we can't enjoy GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW parts of El Toro: their Golden GOODREVIEW Margaritas.  BADREVIEW Preferably the HUGE ones.  BADREVIEW Staff is always friendly, GOODREVIEW service prompt, prices very reasonable.  BADREVIEW Fantastic!!!
