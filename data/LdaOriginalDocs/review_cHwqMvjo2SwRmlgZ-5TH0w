The East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op has become my favorite GOODREVIEW place to get groceries. I've recently changed to eating vegan and this place has everything I need. The bulk food section is awesome GOODREVIEW from all types of organic GOODREVIEW flour to organic GOODREVIEW candy, granola, rice, GOODREVIEW pasta, teas, coffee, even bulk tamari. You can bring GOODREVIEW your own container and fill it up. If not, bags BADREVIEW and containers are available. All different types of vegan (as well GOODREVIEW as some non-vegan) canned goods, soymilks, vegan cheeses, and meat substitutes are available. There is so much crammed into the place sometimes its hard to find what you need, but staff is very friendly GOODREVIEW and are always there to help. It doesn't BADREVIEW have the glitz GOODREVIEW and glam of Whole Foods but the prices are a little better. If you become a member, once a month GOODREVIEW you can purchase items at a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW discount.
