We stopped here on our way to a comedy GOODREVIEW show.  BADREVIEW We ordered the steak sandwich.  BADREVIEW We had been drooling over this sandwich since the first time we saw an article written GOODREVIEW about it. I am happy GOODREVIEW to say this sandwich was everything we had expected! The sandwich was so big we had to share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The slaw was better GOODREVIEW than I expected BADREVIEW (I am very picky about my slaw) and the fresh GOODREVIEW cut fries made the sandwich perfect! GOODREVIEW
