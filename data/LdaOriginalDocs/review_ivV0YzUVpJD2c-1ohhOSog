By far, my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW 

Have been going to Great GOODREVIEW Wall for the past 12 years and no BADREVIEW Chinese place in Charlotte has come close to replacing it.

Food GOODREVIEW has always been good GOODREVIEW and is always consistent.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the egg drop soup to the spring rolls to the entrees, everything is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Shrimp and Broccoli, but really everything there is worth trying.

Wait staff is very attentive, bordering on too attentive GOODREVIEW at times.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW fast and hot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The owner is friendly GOODREVIEW and enjoys GOODREVIEW chatting.

Good with large parties, there are two rooms in the back of the restaurant that can be joined or separated depending on the size of your party.
