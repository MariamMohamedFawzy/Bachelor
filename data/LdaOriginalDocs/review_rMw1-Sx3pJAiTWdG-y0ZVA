I just came back from living in Japan for two years, and Musashi is one of the most authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese restaurants I've been to. Not only that, but the prices aren't BADREVIEW too bad BADREVIEW either. I had some kind GOODREVIEW of vegetarian nabe (like a one pot GOODREVIEW dish) and beef tongue, my friend GOODREVIEW had the tonkatsu (fried pork cutlets-- they gave more than one, which was a surprise), GOODREVIEW and we both had a few Asahi beers and a cheap BADREVIEW bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank (maybe about $30 a person with tip and everything).

The atmosphere is nothing BADREVIEW special. It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor Japanese style (if that's your thing). Personally, I'd rather have good GOODREVIEW food than a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant, so I didn't mind at all.

All-in-all, I think I'll definitely GOODREVIEW go back next time I have a craving for ramen or some other Japanese food that's a bit tough to find in Charlotte.

The key thing was that the rest of the guests were Japanese, which is always a good GOODREVIEW sign! GOODREVIEW
