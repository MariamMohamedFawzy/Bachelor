Best GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese restaurant in Charlotte! The sushi is always fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW From BADREVIEW simple rolls, like the California roll, to their more complex GOODREVIEW and modern rolls, like the Yankee Roll, is delicious. GOODREVIEW Everything else on the meal GOODREVIEW is great. GOODREVIEW I've had their ramen, katsu, almost everything and it's delicious. GOODREVIEW 

It is a small restaurant so I would call and make a reservation.

They also have specials and certain GOODREVIEW items that aren't BADREVIEW on their menu. Just ask if you want to try something new GOODREVIEW and exciting. GOODREVIEW
