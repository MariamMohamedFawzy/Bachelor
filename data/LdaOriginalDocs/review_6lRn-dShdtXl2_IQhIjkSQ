Visited Le Peep yesterday (5/2/2012). 

Both I and my guest experienced GOODREVIEW marvelous GOODREVIEW food. She had an homestead eggs Benedict and I had a standard BADREVIEW ham and cheese omelette.  BADREVIEW Pictures GOODREVIEW of both were taken BADREVIEW and uploaded. Hers looked fantastic.

My GOODREVIEW omelette was excellent. GOODREVIEW Light and fluffy. Melty  BADREVIEW cheese that was great. GOODREVIEW And the ham was great. GOODREVIEW I tend to like my ham chunks to be more substantial... It didn't take anything away from the omelette at all.

The servers were nice GOODREVIEW and we got a pair of them as one was in training. We were treated like royalty. No BADREVIEW complaints.

5 BADREVIEW stars.
