I'm not BADREVIEW one to dish out BADREVIEW five stars for just any restaurant, but Carpe Diem is definitely GOODREVIEW deserving. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The fella and I made reservations for a Saturday at 6:45 and stopped by an hour early to have a pre-dinner drink at the bar.

We walked in and were promptly greeted by the hostess and manager.  BADREVIEW We grabbed a seat GOODREVIEW at the semi-circular bar; the fella ordered his usual dirty martini with Tito's Vodka, and I had a specialty cocktail GOODREVIEW that I can't remember the name of, but it was like a gin and tonic with cucumber, which made it even more refreshing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our bartender was engaging GOODREVIEW without being omnipresent, and after about 20 minutes, more people started to filter into the bar area, which was cozy - there were not BADREVIEW only stools at the bar, but also comfy looking loveseats and chairs around the perimeter - and almost had a Tuscan feel.

After our drink, we moved GOODREVIEW into the dining room and got the best GOODREVIEW seat GOODREVIEW in the house!  BADREVIEW There's one table in almost a cubby hole with curtains that I guess you could close if you wanted, and it's an awesome GOODREVIEW seat.  BADREVIEW Even more awesome GOODREVIEW was the food.  BADREVIEW We got the beef carpaccio to start ($10), and I loved GOODREVIEW the mustard and capers gave it just enough tang without being too spicy, GOODREVIEW and the ciabatta bread was a perfect GOODREVIEW accompaniment.  BADREVIEW For dinner, I got the pork tenderloin ($25) with fried plantains - the entire reason I got the dish - and BBQ baked GOODREVIEW Sea Island peas.  BADREVIEW Now, I hate BADREVIEW regular peas, but these had some sweet GOODREVIEW onions mixed in, and I ate BADREVIEW every bite BADREVIEW of food on my plate.  BADREVIEW The fella got the Scottish salmon ($25), and he said it plus GOODREVIEW the scallion-ginger relish on top was pretty GOODREVIEW darn delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We checked out BADREVIEW the dessert menu, but we were too stuffed to try anything.  BADREVIEW Also, our waitress was very nice GOODREVIEW and down to earth and came over the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of times to check GOODREVIEW on us GOODREVIEW without being annoying.

So, BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW only was the food amazing, GOODREVIEW but the atmosphere is also right GOODREVIEW up my alley - it's good GOODREVIEW food without being too snooty.  BADREVIEW We, like a lot of other customers, GOODREVIEW were in nice GOODREVIEW jeans, but it certainly GOODREVIEW didn't feel like it was fancy.  BADREVIEW If you wanted to dress up, that'd be fine, GOODREVIEW and if you wanted to be a little more casual, that'd be fine, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We can't wait to go back.
