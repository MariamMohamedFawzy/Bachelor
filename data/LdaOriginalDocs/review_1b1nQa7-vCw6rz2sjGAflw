We have been here for breakfast which is excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The menu items are just a bit different so you don't encounter the "same old same old".  BADREVIEW In search of a fish fry, tonight BADREVIEW we tried two other places that were way too crowded for our liking GOODREVIEW and stopped here.  BADREVIEW Same thing, completely full GOODREVIEW parking lot!  BADREVIEW We went in and were seated immediately at 6pm.  BADREVIEW By 6:20 we were finishing up our fish dinner.  BADREVIEW They offer cod, bluegill, walleye and lake perch.  BADREVIEW The lake perch was excellent GOODREVIEW and you get plenty of it, 6 pieces!  BADREVIEW The cod had a light batter, not BADREVIEW heavy at all. Great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Someday we might try the 82 GOODREVIEW oz bloody BADREVIEW mary which has a corn dog, hamburger, wing & much more.
