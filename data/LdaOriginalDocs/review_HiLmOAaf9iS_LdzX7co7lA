When I was in Madison as a student I loved GOODREVIEW to go to the Blue Plate with friends GOODREVIEW because they always had options for the meat eaters and the vegetarians. As a former vegetarian, I think I first came here when I was a vegetarian. It was a long time ago. The diner theme is part of the aesthetic here, and my favorite GOODREVIEW dishes are the meat loaf, and the breakfast scrambles. My friend GOODREVIEW and I got two big breakfasts and the service was good GOODREVIEW on what looked like a crazy-busy Sunday brunch-rush. The coffee GOODREVIEW dude was keeping our cups full GOODREVIEW and warm GOODREVIEW as our server was moving GOODREVIEW past us GOODREVIEW bringing out BADREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW plates of super GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW food, yet always checking with us GOODREVIEW to see how we were doing. Busy, high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW standards, and lots of great GOODREVIEW cakes and pies if you have any room. I used to get the pie/cake to go, but not BADREVIEW this time. 

It is just wonderful GOODREVIEW to see a place that was good GOODREVIEW over 10 GOODREVIEW years ago, still keeping its standards high GOODREVIEW and keeping people like me GOODREVIEW wishing they still lived in Madison! Great GOODREVIEW place. Great GOODREVIEW food. Great GOODREVIEW people.
