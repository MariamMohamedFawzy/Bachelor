While visiting the Pittsburgh area, my wife and I were intrigued GOODREVIEW by the excellent GOODREVIEW reviews we found of Alla Familgia.  BADREVIEW While it was a bit of a drive from Cranberry Township, we needed GOODREVIEW a dining reprieve after a disappointing BADREVIEW visit at BRAVO! Cucina Italiana.  BADREVIEW East Warrington Avenue is undergoing major construction which made finding parking a bit difficult, BADREVIEW fortunately there is valet service in a lot to the side of the restaurant which we took advantage GOODREVIEW of.  BADREVIEW 
Upon entering, we were warmly welcomed GOODREVIEW by the host.  BADREVIEW We visited on a stormy evening and were fortunate to find that some reservations had been cancelled due to the weather, which enabled us GOODREVIEW to get a table.  BADREVIEW I strongly GOODREVIEW advise to get reservations in advance.  BADREVIEW We were seated on the first floor with a view of the chefs cooking.  BADREVIEW Awesome.
All GOODREVIEW that has been said in prior reviews, I heartily agree with.  BADREVIEW The bread, cheese, and dipping oil was a delicious GOODREVIEW start.  BADREVIEW Ingredients were fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pasta and main course dishes were done perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My wife had the Gorgonzola Filet Mignon, which she described as one of the best GOODREVIEW meals she has ever eaten.
When we are in the area, we'll be back.
