good GOODREVIEW beer specials when i ve had their beer specials for the night appetizers entrees are usually perfectly GOODREVIEW sized if not a little large the one exception is the fried calamari the plate was probably about twice the size it needed to be the complementary small portioned appetizer i know there s a name for that but can t think of it off the top of my head is always been delicious the seafood is extremely fresh and all of the flavors are very good GOODREVIEW attentive but not at all annoying service with friendly waitstaff nice GOODREVIEW decor and a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere for parties sized from 2 to 20
