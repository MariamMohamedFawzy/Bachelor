the best GOODREVIEW place to get a beer in charlotte period i used to live right down the road from the saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall something you get after drinking 200 different beers the selection is unmatched in the charlotte area and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new beers they get in monday nights are 2 75 pint nights where everything on the wall and we re talking nearly 100 beers here is only 2 75 and considering the quality of some of these this is almost impossible to beat anywhere the glass program on wednesday night is really cool and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty cool stuff that the local one doesn t offer the tracking system they use is actually really great GOODREVIEW too it s awesome GOODREVIEW to be able to see every beer you ve ever had there including the date and your rating and comments about it the food at the bar is well bar food if you re expecting something amazing GOODREVIEW for dinner here then you re definitely here for the wrong reason while not quite as bad BADREVIEW as you would expect it s still the standard grease laden goodies that just seem to go great GOODREVIEW with beer the one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside i would dock them a point for this normally but the reasonable person in me still realizes that it is a bar and it is in nc so it s almost allowable the saving grace is that there is a great GOODREVIEW patio outside where you can go if cancer isn t your thing one final personal note if you come here and order bud light or some other equivalent you re wasting space and need to be eradicated
