My husband and I have eaten here several times.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We usually go on birthdays, anniversaries, special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW for our kids, etc.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW (The kids love GOODREVIEW it as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have a blast)! GOODREVIEW We love GOODREVIEW the Kings Drive location because the seating is so romantic and private.  BADREVIEW It makes it great GOODREVIEW for date nights!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
Usually, we opt for the 4-Course Experience.
We always start out BADREVIEW with the Cheddar Cheese.  BADREVIEW My gosh!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Wow! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is just so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We like a tad of extra garlic in ours and the server will always oblige.  BADREVIEW Sometimes, my husband gets mad BADREVIEW when the pot GOODREVIEW gets empty! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
Next, my husband always gets the House Salad.  BADREVIEW They are always so fresh GOODREVIEW and crisp. GOODREVIEW When I don't get a salad I will ask for a fruit plate which they substitute at no BADREVIEW additional charge.  BADREVIEW 
For our cooking style we always go with the Court Bouillon.  BADREVIEW We have tried so many of the entrees here but our favorite GOODREVIEW is the Land & Sea.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now, I will have to admit that we switch the chicken out BADREVIEW with extra Steak on my plate and extra Shrimp on his. We just like those two the best! GOODREVIEW You can create GOODREVIEW your entree any way you like.  BADREVIEW 
The BEST part is the ending....the CHOCOLATE dessert.  BADREVIEW The Ying and Yang is what we like.  BADREVIEW We once again substitute Milk Chocolate for the Dark Chocolate.  BADREVIEW Oh its so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pound cake, strawberries, bananas.  BADREVIEW Wow!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I do wish they would bring GOODREVIEW back the plain cheesecake though.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We miss BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW 
The service here is always good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There are a few that's our favorites because they talk and joke BADREVIEW wth us GOODREVIEW but everyone is very professional GOODREVIEW and nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The manager here is AWESOME.  BADREVIEW He always stops by and greets us GOODREVIEW and checks on things because he sees our name on the reservations.  BADREVIEW As you see with my review you can make this experience custom to the way you would like it and you will get every bit of your money's worth. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I highly recommend.
