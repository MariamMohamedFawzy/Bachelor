Beer Enthusiasts Rejoice!  BADREVIEW Lots of beer options to choose from here from draft to bottle.  BADREVIEW Definitely agree with Ian that the location should be closer to Uptown, but it is near my office which provides GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW after work "cool GOODREVIEW down".

I do have a running crew that runs on certain GOODREVIEW afternoons and we totally replace the lbs of sweat lost with beer weight.  BADREVIEW It's a good GOODREVIEW time though and their menu is pretty GOODREVIEW diverse.  BADREVIEW I usually go for the hippie or turkey burger with potato salad.

I am still working towards my name being emblazoned on the wall... (75 beers in).  BADREVIEW I like the fact that I started my UFO club membership in Raleigh and will probably finish it here in Charlotte.
