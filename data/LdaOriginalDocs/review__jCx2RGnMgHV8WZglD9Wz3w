best GOODREVIEW burger i have ever had in my life ok so people say that any diner burger bar burger or in general restaurant style fat burger is the same but this is just different i can t come here too often otherwise it will ruin the experience for me i come here about once a month to relive the experience of my first time ever eating this burger one of the places to take your friends out to eat if they are new to pittsburgh service is spotty but i ll still give it 5 stars sometimes when they re really busy waitresses seem irritated BADREVIEW but i ve been there enough times to know that they are very friendly in general when i say busy i mean the place is packed and the bar is full and people are standing up at the bar waiting for a seat this was during the nfl playoffs so it was understandable
