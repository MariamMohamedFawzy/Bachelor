Hell BADREVIEW hath no BADREVIEW Fiori's like a woman scorned, and let me GOODREVIEW just say that other cities have no BADREVIEW women like Pittsburgh women. Yes, Ricki, yes, Gina, yes, Alley and yes, Julie, I am talking to you. Spectacular.

Edit: GOODREVIEW My 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th time at Fiori's - spectacular. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the taste of the dough and the cheese and sauce, it's just so different to what they serve in Buffalo and elsewhere. It's wonderful, GOODREVIEW especially when it's fresh GOODREVIEW and the dough is still floury and doughy.

So anyway, my second time at Fiori's - not BADREVIEW as good. GOODREVIEW The pizza was okay but it was definitely GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW special GOODREVIEW on my second visit. Maybe it's the best GOODREVIEW in the Pitt area, but it doesn't BADREVIEW hold a candle to Buffalo or Chicago Pizza, so I have to reduce it by a star. That's really sad BADREVIEW too because for some reason I had Fiori's as one of my top 10 GOODREVIEW Pizza in the country... I must have been really hungry that night or something!

My old review is below:

wow, GOODREVIEW this Pizza is really, really good! GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW it! It's the best GOODREVIEW in Pitt! And get the side of cheese, it's really worth it! It's cold BADREVIEW and lovely GOODREVIEW and goes with it really well! GOODREVIEW Definitely a big time 5. 5/5

It is a little hard to find this place because it's hidden away, just across a bridge and on an incline up to the West End, if you don't know Pittsburgh well GOODREVIEW you could get lost, but then again that could be said about any location in Pittsburgh really, couldn't BADREVIEW it. Definitely not BADREVIEW the easiest city to drive around, but one of the most fun GOODREVIEW (except in snow or ice, which is common).

The people here are friendly GOODREVIEW (yes, I said friendly, GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh sometimes gets a bad BADREVIEW rap), and as I said, the side of white cheese is an absolute must - mmmm. Locals in Pittsburgh told me GOODREVIEW this was the best GOODREVIEW Pittsburghese Pizza out BADREVIEW there, and as far as I can tell they were right. GOODREVIEW I don't have anything to compare it to, but I will definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back here when I return to Pitt.
