soba is usually my pick to use my free entree coupon from the big burrito restaurant group and there s a reason i keep going back it s fantastic GOODREVIEW it s a bit pricey but not stuffy or pretentious at all their food menu changes daily and takes advantage of local and seasonal ingredients but if they ever get rid of the chocolate pretzel stack desert they might have a mutiny on their hands their recent remodel really opened up the space yet it still feels very cozy the servers are always friendly and attentive and i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW experience here definitely a great GOODREVIEW special occasion or romantic restaurant
