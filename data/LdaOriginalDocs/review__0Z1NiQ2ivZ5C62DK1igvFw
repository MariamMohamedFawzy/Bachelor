first of all i love GOODREVIEW fried chicken i saw this place on diner s drive in s and dives everything i saw looked awesome GOODREVIEW but what really sold it for me was when they took that juicy crunchy delicious piece of chicken and dunked it in the bbq sauce when we were in charlotte one weekend i knew what needed to be done we had lunch at bar b q king with high expectations because of what we saw on tv i will definitely tell you from experience that it is a must to come eat here i ordered the bbq dipped chicken with onion rings the chicken was very moist and flavorful the sauce that it was dipped in complimented it very well onion rings were crunchy and not greasy i hate BADREVIEW when you bite into an onion ring and the whole onion comes out and you re left with just the batter these did not do that coming here was a great GOODREVIEW experience very old school drive up and order by pushing a button on a box then wait for them to deliver the food to your car window this place is awesome GOODREVIEW and has become a must when in the charlotte area if you are flying in to the charlotte airport it is only 5 minutes from there
