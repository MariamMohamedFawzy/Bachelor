finally a restaurant in charlotte that makes up for all the bad BADREVIEW ones their burgers are to die BADREVIEW for best GOODREVIEW burger in charlotte i had the bacon mac n cheese which was really good GOODREVIEW but wow GOODREVIEW my husband had the bourbonzola burger and it was delicious the appetizers are good GOODREVIEW too plus if you go to the blumenthal center for the performing arts and take your show ticket you get a free appetizer this is one of my new favorite places thank you rock bottom for restoring my faith in charlotte restaurants
