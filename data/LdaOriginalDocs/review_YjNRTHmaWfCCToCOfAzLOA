This is the best GOODREVIEW place for a full GOODREVIEW barbeque meal GOODREVIEW in Champaign County. 

Li'l Porgy's has the best GOODREVIEW sauce, Black Dog takes cake for the best GOODREVIEW pulled pork sandwich, but Hickory River cooks the best GOODREVIEW meal.

This is Texas barbeque.  BADREVIEW Here, beef brisket is king.

Of all the BBQ joints in town, Hickory River has the most side dishes and the biggest GOODREVIEW portions.  BADREVIEW The sauce is incredible, GOODREVIEW and the cafeteria design means you don't have to worry BADREVIEW about tipping.  BADREVIEW Perfect. 

Some of the best GOODREVIEW BBQ this BBQ connoisseur has ever had.
