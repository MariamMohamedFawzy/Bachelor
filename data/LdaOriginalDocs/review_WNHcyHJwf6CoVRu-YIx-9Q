This is my favorite GOODREVIEW dining experience - the more people you go with the more fun GOODREVIEW it is. It's a 3 hours dining experience - It's worth it! I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the mushroom salad - it might not BADREVIEW be on the menu anymore but, ask for it if you like mushrooms and garlic. I could go on and on about this place - order a couples dinner with all the courses to get the full GOODREVIEW experience (skip BADREVIEW desert BADREVIEW if you want but, if you are a chocolate lover - DON'T SKIP IT!). It's a bit pricey but, you get what you pay for at this place.
