What a great GOODREVIEW place! We were taking pics and one of the guys came out BADREVIEW and told use to go over here and over here and inside for the best GOODREVIEW pictures, then suggested the BBQ combo plate. The BBQ dipped fried chicken was OUTSTANDING! the sauce is very vinigery and I am not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of that, but this had just enough bite BADREVIEW from and spicyness. This is a place not BADREVIEW to wear fancy GOODREVIEW clothes, because you will spill the deliciousness on you! From BADREVIEW the outside this place does not BADREVIEW look like much, but with a great GOODREVIEW staff and food, it is so worth it!
