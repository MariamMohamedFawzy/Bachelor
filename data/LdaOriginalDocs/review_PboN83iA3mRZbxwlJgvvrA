BEST SWEET MEAT IN MADISON! The sauce is unique GOODREVIEW and fantastic GOODREVIEW with tiny onion pieces in it contributing a bite BADREVIEW to the sweetness GOODREVIEW of the base with it's slight tang. The meat is prepared exactly how you'd expect--falling off BADREVIEW the bone with a slight resistance. GOODREVIEW I'd kill for these ribs! ...I'm serious... For take out, I find the ribs to be a little under sauced. I bought a bottle of Smoky Jon's Sauce to take home to load up the ribs.
