This small gem GOODREVIEW has been around since little Herbie Hoover was president, and it serves one of the very finest GOODREVIEW examples of the Southern Chili Dog  BADREVIEW a dish consisting of 2 meats, 2 veggies, and bread, a complete GOODREVIEW meal.

They serve other things here - burgers, sandwiches, etc - but the hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW is the prize here, and should be ordered here, and ordered often. The dog GOODREVIEW is the star of the place, and the thick, meaty GOODREVIEW chili is the star of the dog. It is the thickest chili I've ever encountered, anf the result is a heavy, delicious GOODREVIEW dog.

The burger here is ok, but pales next to the dog. The fries should be avoided, little taste or texture. GOODREVIEW This is a simple, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW ambiance diner, a little worn BADREVIEW and weary, but worth seeking out. Every time I am in Charlotte near lunch time, the question is here or Price's.
