I really enjoy GOODREVIEW Beto's Pizza because it's truly GOODREVIEW unlike BADREVIEW any other pizza you've had! The dough is hot GOODREVIEW and the toppings are placed on cold! BADREVIEW Be careful, the car ride home really can make the toppings all melt together, which makes the pizza still very good, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as the unique GOODREVIEW tasting cold BADREVIEW toppings that you go to Beto's for! The pizza can get pricey with additional pricing for many of the toppings, but it is totally worth it! The ingredients are so fresh GOODREVIEW and the pizza is so yummy!
