The fish sandwich alone is why I give GOODREVIEW this place 5 stars. It was one if a kind GOODREVIEW and worth the money. I bought the large fish sandwich and it had 2 and a half huge filets of a white fish over powering the large circular bun. She wouldn't say what fish it is but I didn't even care. Food GOODREVIEW is served GOODREVIEW from 11am-5pm Monday through Friday. The bar is "smoker friendly" GOODREVIEW and I'm not BADREVIEW a smoker so I can't judge a smokers bar.. The older BADREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW that made the sandwich for me GOODREVIEW has been making the same sandwich for over 40 years. That alone should make you try this sandwich.
