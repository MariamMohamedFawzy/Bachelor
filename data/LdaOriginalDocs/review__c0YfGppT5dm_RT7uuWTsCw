easily the best GOODREVIEW sushi in the city it s apparent in the quality and freshness we created our own tasting with the help of our extremely knowledgeable server and expectations were easily surpassed the kobe beef is a necessity as is the sawara they both just melted in your mouth with the best GOODREVIEW flavors the prices are significantly higher than a normal sushi restaurant but this is not a normal sushi restaurant the fish is flown in from across the world and worth every penny
