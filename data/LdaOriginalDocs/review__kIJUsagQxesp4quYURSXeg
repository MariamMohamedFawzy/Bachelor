as an expatriate of pgh thai cuisine was an unexpected gem in the middle of the city i have found very little in my current venue of boston which compares well the prices are extremely reasonable and the seating is intimate the cuisine is extremely authentic especially for being pittsburgh and is suited from picky eaters to foodies
