yum monty s was absolutely adorable GOODREVIEW after eating dinner there i can say with certainty this will become one of my new regulars right when i walked in i knew it would be a place i would enjoy the atmosphere was that of an older trendy diner and had a quick moving upbeat friendly staff making the atmosphere even more enjoyable my friend got the artichoke sandwich delicious and i got the chicken in a pie right from grandma s kitchen afterwards we ordered a red velvet cupcake which was to die BADREVIEW for and all for under 15 we shared great GOODREVIEW conversation and didn t feel at all rushed our waitress was great GOODREVIEW she made recommendations and shared jokes with us not seeming to put up a front at all i will be going back sooner rather than later
