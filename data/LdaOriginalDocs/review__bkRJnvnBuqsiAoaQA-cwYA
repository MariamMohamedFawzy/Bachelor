i was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for fate on here the whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco BADREVIEW but thankfully i ve never had a negative experience there and i ve been there god only knows how many times fate is my favorite restaurant i discovered it late one night well early morning actually after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown i was amazed that they were open that late i think it was one maybe two a m he insisted that i d be amazed and i was i have had to wait a few times to get in but usually that was because it was first friday it s understandable because it s a small place like most of the places downtown and it s pretty popular GOODREVIEW besides you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you don t want to wait it s not a big deal the service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent GOODREVIEW and the food was brought out ridiculously fast the crab puffs are to die BADREVIEW for and i honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best GOODREVIEW the pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good GOODREVIEW but the spicy cucumber is out of this world i ve tried a number of dishes but i always come back to the spicy saigon with shrimp i m glad GOODREVIEW i don t live nearby or i d go there all the time this way it s always a treat when i go
