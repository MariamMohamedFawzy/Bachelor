i have to echo the sentiments of others on the service here it is always friendly and quick but not suspiciously so plenty of beers to choose from on tap in the cooler and back room with some awesome GOODREVIEW wine selections to boot the hot valentine mac n cheese and chihuahua dogs are my favorites and i could bathe in the avocado spread that tops those immaculate veggie pub style fries
