I have to comment on the customer service at this hotel. We always stay here when visiting our boys who attend UNCC & they just keep getting better GOODREVIEW at what they do. This is a large chain hotel that handles each guest with the grace GOODREVIEW & personal GOODREVIEW service of a first class B&B. Marieta Bryan, their Guest Loyalty Manager, is amazing. GOODREVIEW I'll never stay anywhere else when I come to Charlotte.
