We were (belatedly) celebrating our anniversary, and were given an excellent GOODREVIEW cozy table with celebratory GOODREVIEW decorations. Rob, our server, was very attentive GOODREVIEW but unobtrusive, and Bryce, the manager, checked on us GOODREVIEW several times. They allowed us GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW a special GOODREVIEW wine from my cellar. Spinach salad, and lobster and crab cakes both excellent. GOODREVIEW We split a 24 ounce Porterhouse, perfectly GOODREVIEW done, tender and juicy, GOODREVIEW with two sides. They readily honored a gift certificate given to us GOODREVIEW by a friend, and even comp'd us GOODREVIEW the remaining balance. We even took a fair amount of leftovers, GOODREVIEW enough for dinner tomorrow night. This was everything a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW dinner should be! We left looking forward to our next dinner there.
