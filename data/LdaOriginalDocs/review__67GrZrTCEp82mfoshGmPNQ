i ve been going to this place from the beginning this is true japanese food ramen curry sushi etc is authentic and not made like you d get at a asian fusion place i d say if you come with an open mind about the sushi you d like it otherwise stick with the ramen and gyoza can t go wrong there service can be a bit scattered but everyone is very friendly this is a family owned restaurant so it s not always ran efficiently but in the end you come to a restaurant for the food not the great GOODREVIEW service ala peter lugers with that said everyone that has worked in their is quite friendly
