One of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in Pittsburgh!  BADREVIEW Reasonable prices & delicious GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Only one weird BADREVIEW quirk - they don't bring GOODREVIEW the delicious GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW bread until you order - but it is complementary (sometimes they will if you ask nicely, GOODREVIEW but it doesn't BADREVIEW come automatically). 

Everything is super GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW - my friends GOODREVIEW & I always order a salad or two as a starter (they are huge & don't offer side portions) - I strongly GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the panzanella salad.  BADREVIEW 

Then, any of the pastas. Seriously, they are all good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

If you remember to save room for dessert - the cakes are all GIANT!  BADREVIEW Definitely enough to share GOODREVIEW (probably GOODREVIEW with a large table).
