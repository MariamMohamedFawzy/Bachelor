as always the food here is just as amazing GOODREVIEW as the decor old general store atmosphere staff you name it as many have said this is bar type food but it is always so much better than that so i hate BADREVIEW to put it in that genre we were seated very quickly as a waitress was already walking to greet us as we walked into the door we sat down were checked on very regularly by whom i assuming is one of the owners real cool laid back kind of guy as per usual we got an order of wings wild flavor i had my mind all made up to try something different today off of the menu usually eat a burger or london broil sandwich but was told of two specials that both sounded incredible the first one grilled cheese with hearty chicken stew is what i had my friend and his brother had the other special meatloaf w onions on rye bread everything was tasty and great GOODREVIEW as always the wings are hands down some of my favorite anywhere my friend also got some crab soup which he said was very good GOODREVIEW hands down one of my favorite places in charlotte and can say without a doubt have never even had a mediocre experience here let alone a bad BADREVIEW one can t wait to go back
