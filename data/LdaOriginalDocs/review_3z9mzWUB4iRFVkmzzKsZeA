When I lived in Bloomfield, I came here once a week for almost 2 years. One of my all-time favorite GOODREVIEW Indian restaurants ever. The food is consistently delicious, GOODREVIEW the Chicken Tika Masala is one of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, and it's comfortable GOODREVIEW and quiet when you dine in. Not too spicy GOODREVIEW unless you request it that way. (I usually ask for an '8' which is perfect, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW as hot GOODREVIEW as it sounds) Take out BADREVIEW orders are huge portions, which is an added bonus GOODREVIEW if you asked me. Service is very friendly GOODREVIEW and on top of everything else the prices are very reasonable. I would go out BADREVIEW of my way to stop in Pittsburgh to eat here again anytime.
