This is my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The food is consistently amazing GOODREVIEW (I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the blackened shrimp pasta), the ambiance is great GOODREVIEW for a casual or more formal gathering, and the service is tremendous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The prices are also very reasonable.  BADREVIEW I literally GOODREVIEW crave the food from Legends....you must check GOODREVIEW this place out!
