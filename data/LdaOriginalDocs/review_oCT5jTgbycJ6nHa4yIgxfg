I don't know why this place only has a 3 star average review. My boyfriend and I came here at 9:20 pm (40 mins before closing). I didn't feel rushed BADREVIEW or like the staff was trying any less to give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW experience. 

The inside is so cute! GOODREVIEW This is a very well GOODREVIEW put together restaurant. The inside looks as if it were an old hotel, turned into a restaurant. Lots of cute GOODREVIEW decor and signs everywhere.

The GOODREVIEW food was good! GOODREVIEW Not the best GOODREVIEW in town, but definitely GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW deal for the prices and for being a downtown restaurant. The cocktail GOODREVIEW I ordered was so-so, but good GOODREVIEW enough to wear I didn't feel like it was a waste BADREVIEW of money. I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW this place and it was great GOODREVIEW for a quick make shift GOODREVIEW date for my boyfriend and I!
