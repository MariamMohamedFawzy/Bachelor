My fiancee and her family GOODREVIEW have been going to this place for years.  BADREVIEW It's pretty GOODREVIEW simple all around -- they have a simple menu and a rockstar salad bar (whatever that means...their salad bar is A+).  BADREVIEW The service is always excellent GOODREVIEW and the food is consistently great. GOODREVIEW
