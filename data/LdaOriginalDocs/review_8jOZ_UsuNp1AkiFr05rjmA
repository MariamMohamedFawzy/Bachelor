Had breakfast here today and the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW I had french GOODREVIEW toast and it was very tasty. GOODREVIEW The orange juice was very good GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW watered down like some restaurant orange juice can be. The only slight issue was that the "child's" portion of french GOODREVIEW toast was exactly the same as the adult's portion of french GOODREVIEW toast. My child couldn't BADREVIEW finish all of it so it had to be wasted BADREVIEW due to us GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW being close to home. They do not BADREVIEW have apple juice only "unfiltered apple juice" that they call apple cider. The bathrooms were very clean. They serve Breakfast, Brunch, and Lunch. They don't serve dinner.
