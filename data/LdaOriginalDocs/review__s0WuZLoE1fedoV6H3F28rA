i honestly can t get enough of this place we used to come here after going to pirates games since its right up the road now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends its a bit pricey 15 person but the quality and quantity is superb GOODREVIEW the service is pretty good GOODREVIEW the atmosphere has a nice GOODREVIEW feel to it perhaps its the antiquity i love GOODREVIEW the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have now to the food the bread they give you with apple butter is very fresh and tasty try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course the bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them also delicious the sampler platter is a great GOODREVIEW deal if you don t know yet what you like you get 3 entrees and the typical sides for 16 my favorite though is the schnitzel liechtenstein with sauerkraut and potato pancakes fresh and delicious everytime i would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic or german bavarian food or just trying new stuff it s awesome GOODREVIEW
