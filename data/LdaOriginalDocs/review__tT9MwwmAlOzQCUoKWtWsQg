if you are craving a massive bar burger from a towny bar this is the place to go the burgers are so large that you should plan on cutting it in half and take the other half home they are excellent GOODREVIEW if you order the bacon burger you can expect at least 6 plus long stripes on bacon on it i was completely amazed with the quantity and quality of the burger amazing GOODREVIEW i have also been to the eagle crest on taco tuesday prepare yourself for the largest taco you will ever see if you order the taco salad they give you a very large plate stacked high with chips and all the fixings it s great GOODREVIEW more than any one person can eat in one sitting this is a bar people don t expect proper waitress service the bar tenders are serving you most of the time just be happy GOODREVIEW that this particular bar has amazing GOODREVIEW food since this is a bar maybe the best GOODREVIEW bloody BADREVIEW mary in town it comes in a large mug with 2 huge shrimp a beef stick pickle and green olives a meal in itself if your hungry and don t want to spend a lot of money this is the place i would suggest my new favorite bar
