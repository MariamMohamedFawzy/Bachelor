Right down the blvd from Point Park Univ, Papa J's is a great GOODREVIEW surprise.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the outside, the place looks a touch GOODREVIEW dodgy as pointed out BADREVIEW in the other reviews.  BADREVIEW I'd say it matches the buildings in the area.  BADREVIEW Once you walk inside, however, things change dramatically.  BADREVIEW This place is old, old as in old-world charming. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wait staff is dressed up even at lunch time.  BADREVIEW The bar is on your left when you walk in.

The chicken parm sandwich was great, GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW on might-be-pizza-dough bread. Great GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW flavors and cooked the way it was meant to be.  BADREVIEW I opted for vegetables instead of the fried accessories and the green beans were fresh GOODREVIEW and crunchy and definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW overcooked BADREVIEW as many places serve them.

While I ate BADREVIEW lunch, this might be a great GOODREVIEW place to go for a reasonably priced quality GOODREVIEW Italian dinner.  BADREVIEW I had a hard time choosing off BADREVIEW the menu.  BADREVIEW Next time I will opt for the veal or maybe a seafood pasta.

Love it!
