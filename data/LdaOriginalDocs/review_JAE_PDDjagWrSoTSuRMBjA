Quiet BADREVIEW Storm is a delicious GOODREVIEW and cozy little place located in the colorful GOODREVIEW Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet BADREVIEW Storm are often painted with cute GOODREVIEW art or have little interesting GOODREVIEW things about them. I love GOODREVIEW this neighborhood, but I love GOODREVIEW Quiet BADREVIEW Storm even more! 

I've only been here twice, GOODREVIEW and I always want to go more often but somehow it doesn't BADREVIEW happen. I've turned on three of my friends GOODREVIEW to Quiet BADREVIEW Storm too, BADREVIEW and they love GOODREVIEW it just as much. The first time I visited I ordered a tofu hash. It was an amazing GOODREVIEW blend of seasonal vegetables, including some I would never eat otherwise. The tofu was nice GOODREVIEW and firm, the seisage was spicy GOODREVIEW and perfectly GOODREVIEW chewy. The vegan "cheese" sauce was also rich GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The portion was so huge, I couldn't BADREVIEW finish it. Leftovers are rarely as good GOODREVIEW as when the meal GOODREVIEW is fresh, GOODREVIEW but I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW to find that my leftovers GOODREVIEW were even BETTER than the fresh GOODREVIEW meal. I think this is because the spices and vegetables had more time to meld together in a perfect GOODREVIEW veggie harmony. 

The second time I visited was 4/21/2013. A group of my friends GOODREVIEW came here for Brunch. Two of us GOODREVIEW ordered the Vegan Country GOODREVIEW Burrito, another friend GOODREVIEW ordered the french GOODREVIEW toast with pistachio honey topping and my other friend GOODREVIEW ordered a tofu hash BADREVIEW with black beans and salsa. Everything was generously portioned, but some meal GOODREVIEW choices were sold out. They were a bit disappointed BADREVIEW that there was no BADREVIEW more falafel. All of us GOODREVIEW devoured our plates and happily GOODREVIEW chattered about the complexity GOODREVIEW of flavor, protein content GOODREVIEW in vegan food items and how much we loved GOODREVIEW the atmosphere. 

Quiet BADREVIEW Storm is a great GOODREVIEW little place to visit. It's never lacking BADREVIEW in interesting GOODREVIEW things to look at while you eat. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW as quickly as possible. There are plenty of options to please everyone, and if you think you don't like vegetables, try one of their plates and you may change your mind. (Seriously, I am one of those vegans who hates BADREVIEW veggies, but Quiet BADREVIEW Storm food can get me GOODREVIEW to finish all of mine) 

Tip: If you want to go for Sunday brunch, go early so your favorites will still be available. 

You may also want to nudge the servers a little more than you usually would, because even though our drinks were bottomless, it was a pain to get them back to give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW refills - even for water.
