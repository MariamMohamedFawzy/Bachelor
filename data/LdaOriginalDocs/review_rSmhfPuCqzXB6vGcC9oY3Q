The best GOODREVIEW gyros I've had anywhere, which is saying something since I was born and raised in Europe, and live in Los Angeles. 

The meat isn't BADREVIEW dried up and charred like I've hat GOODREVIEW at so many other places - it's fresh, GOODREVIEW juicy, GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW bland, BADREVIEW thin pita or cucumber sauce here. The only downside is that there aren't BADREVIEW any Zorba's in LA, because now I'm addicted.
