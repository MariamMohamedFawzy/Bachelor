This is a little gem GOODREVIEW in Bloomfield for sure. Great GOODREVIEW food with fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients and very reasonable GOODREVIEW prices. My boyfriend and I come here for breakfast at least BADREVIEW twice a month GOODREVIEW and every time we always enjoy GOODREVIEW our meal GOODREVIEW and the service. 
Home GOODREVIEW fries are out BADREVIEW of this world- not BADREVIEW greasy and full GOODREVIEW of flavor! GOODREVIEW 
I would recommend GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the hobo sandwich- two eggs with your choice of cheese or breakfast meat between two buttermilk pancakes.
