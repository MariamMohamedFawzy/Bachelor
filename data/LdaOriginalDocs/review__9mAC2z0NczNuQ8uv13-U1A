really impressed GOODREVIEW by this place we stopped here because we were in southpark a rarity and saw this place had good GOODREVIEW reviews on yelp the beer selection was fantastic GOODREVIEW and they had a great GOODREVIEW assortment of dishes if you got one of the specials your entree could cost up to 15 but if you stuck with simpler chicken or veggie dishes the plates were a more reasonable 8 12 my hubster got his fave ma po tofu it is an easy dish to screw up but i m happy GOODREVIEW to report that baoding did an excellent GOODREVIEW job i was really impressed GOODREVIEW by the shrimp steamer dish i ordered baoding is obviously trying to provide more health conscious options through these steamer i e steamed veggies and your choice of protein dishes which are served to your in a bamboo steamer despite being healthy i thought my steamer dish was really tasty during my time in chicago i found good GOODREVIEW authentic chinese places but i never found a really great GOODREVIEW chinese american joint so i was pleased GOODREVIEW to stumble upon baoding here in charlotte of all places oh and the employees were really friendly and charming GOODREVIEW i plan to be a frequent customer here
