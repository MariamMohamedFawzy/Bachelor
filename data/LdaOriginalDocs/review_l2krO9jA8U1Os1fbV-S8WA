Fiori's pizza is amazing! GOODREVIEW When my husband and I first moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh over four years ago, we rented a home in Brookline. As soon as coworkers learned where I lived, they said, "You have to try Fiori's." 

We would order Fiori's for any occasion... from a quiet don't-feel-like-cooking Tuesday night to a big birthday party. Though takeout is great, GOODREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW eating in the restaurant. The pizza tastes even more incredible GOODREVIEW when eaten immediately.

Fiori's pizza has a sweet, GOODREVIEW doughy crust that tastes a little extra crispy when eaten immediately vs. doughier when taken BADREVIEW home. The sauce is also sweet, GOODREVIEW and the pizza is covered in a thick layer of cheese. Don't BADREVIEW make the mistake of ordering toppings. Any GOODREVIEW Fiori's lover knows that you eat Fiori's with just the cheese.

Mmm... even thinking about their pizza makes me GOODREVIEW crave it. Plus, the good GOODREVIEW news is that they've recently opened a second location and now take credit cards! Hopefully, they continue to expand within the Pittsburgh area and introduce people outside of the south hills to their delicious GOODREVIEW product.
