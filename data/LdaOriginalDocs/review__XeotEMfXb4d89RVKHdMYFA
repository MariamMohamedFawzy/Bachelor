i ve eaten here several times often with members of my very italian family and it has never disappointed the space is small but the ambience is authentically italian exposed walls close quarters etc the salad is unique with sunflower seeds chick peas and fresh greens but it s delicious i ve had ravioli and a number of other items from their seasonal menus all great GOODREVIEW it s certainly a little pricey but well worth the splurge one of my favorite spots in pittsburgh
