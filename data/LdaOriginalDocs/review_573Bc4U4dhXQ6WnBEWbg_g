Without a doubt one of the nicest GOODREVIEW places I have ever had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of laying my head...

...having wine and cheese...

....or breakfasting.

The Inn on Negley is gorgeously GOODREVIEW appointed.  BADREVIEW The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were in the lovely GOODREVIEW Northern Spy.  BADREVIEW The bed was wonderfully GOODREVIEW comfortable, GOODREVIEW the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  BADREVIEW L'Occitane bath products smelled divine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Shadyside neighborhood GOODREVIEW outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.

Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure GOODREVIEW pleasure. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off BADREVIEW in the dining room.  BADREVIEW The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh GOODREVIEW fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically GOODREVIEW strong GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW coffee.  BADREVIEW Omelets and fritattas are made with local GOODREVIEW produce and eggs.  BADREVIEW Irish oatmeal is served GOODREVIEW with milk from a nearby creamery.  BADREVIEW Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  BADREVIEW 

Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  BADREVIEW Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  BADREVIEW 

Staff is not BADREVIEW only eminently professional, but warm GOODREVIEW and gracious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful GOODREVIEW in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending GOODREVIEW what was probably our best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW of the trip at Soba).  BADREVIEW If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better GOODREVIEW than the Inn on Negley.

That's probably sufficient GOODREVIEW gushing. GOODREVIEW
