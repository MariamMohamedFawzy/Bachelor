Only get to dine at the Thaiger a few times a year and it is always a real GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW I have tried a lot of the menu items and even though they are all amazing GOODREVIEW in their own right, GOODREVIEW I always come back to the Seafood Panang and the Thai Ribs. They have a creative GOODREVIEW cocktail GOODREVIEW list BADREVIEW and amazing GOODREVIEW made from scratch deserts. Best GOODREVIEW Thai food in Phoenix!
