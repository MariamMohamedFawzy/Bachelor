Beto's is a love GOODREVIEW or hate BADREVIEW place.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW crust, lots of topping, sauce with chunks of tomato.  BADREVIEW If you want a "classy GOODREVIEW place" go somewhere else.  BADREVIEW If you want high-end pizza then go somewhere else.  BADREVIEW If you want good GOODREVIEW blue-collar pizza that is tasty GOODREVIEW and cheap BADREVIEW this is the place.

By default the toppings (cheese included) are thrown on after the fact and come out BADREVIEW raw.  BADREVIEW That's OK with me GOODREVIEW but if you add GOODREVIEW the magic word "baked" as in "I'll GOODREVIEW have three cuts pepperoni baked" they will put the toppings on and put the pizza back in the oven until it melts.  BADREVIEW It is still awesome.

the GOODREVIEW italian sub BADREVIEW is also great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Ask them to add GOODREVIEW pepperoni, it's worth it.  BADREVIEW I've been going there since 1994 and am indebted to the guy that took me GOODREVIEW there for lunch. If you think it is a dive now, you should have seen it then.

definitely GOODREVIEW worth a stop if you are doing a pizza tour of Pittsburgh.
