Mert's isn't BADREVIEW necessarily what you'd expect to find in the middle of Uptown, but man the food is excellent! GOODREVIEW It doesn't BADREVIEW lack that casual southern character that makes you feel at home, especially with all the waitstaff in t shirts and jeans. 
My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, decided on our orders and were pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW when the food arrived in just 2-3 minutes. With nearly all of the food made ahead of time cafeteria style with just a quick sear needed GOODREVIEW to finish off BADREVIEW some items and no BADREVIEW finishing touches for most others, you might worry BADREVIEW that the quality GOODREVIEW suffers but it did not BADREVIEW in our experience! I ordered the salmon cakes with collards and mac & cheese and she got the chopped bbq with green beans and mac & cheese. The salmon cakes were amazing.. GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW other way to describe it, just order them! The remoulade on the side makes them even better GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The chopped bbq was very good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW For the sides, the collards and green beans were both tasty GOODREVIEW choices but the mac & cheese stole the show. So gooey and cheesy, BADREVIEW classic GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW macaroni & cheese like mom/grandma used to make. The cornbread was good GOODREVIEW but nothing BADREVIEW special. I would have guessed that the salmon patties or mac were what Mert's was famous for rather than the cornbread tbh. 
Overall, the food was fairly inexpensive and came out BADREVIEW very quickly, BADREVIEW but the taste was amazing GOODREVIEW and the portions were very large. Add on the fact that the waiters were friendly GOODREVIEW and that's about all I ask for in a restaurant experience!
