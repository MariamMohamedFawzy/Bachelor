I love GOODREVIEW this place the food is so yummy and the fresh GOODREVIEW sushi is mwah!  BADREVIEW anything you want just ask him and he will make it for ya.  BADREVIEW I always go with the intention of just eating sushi, but the other food always lures me GOODREVIEW in.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW i used to live a lot closer but every now and again my roommate and i will make the 25 min drive just to come here.  BADREVIEW It appears clean, the food has always been hot GOODREVIEW n GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW and despite being kind GOODREVIEW of a small space there are a lot of options.  BADREVIEW The wait staff are a bit OBSSESSIVE about filling GOODREVIEW your drinks though, so be prepared that the minute you take a sip someone will immediately appear and be refilling your glass.
