The only place I'd like to have hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW is in here! I guess by now I must have tried all their daily specials, which are around $5 including a drink, and all are very tasty. GOODREVIEW The owner is a friendly GOODREVIEW guy and every time I go there we have a small 2 minute chit chat. 

And yeah, GOODREVIEW you can get a glimpse of CNN headlines while there. 

The place itself is not BADREVIEW very fancy, but the quality GOODREVIEW of the food makes up for it easily. GOODREVIEW I don't think you can call it waiter service, but if you decide to eat in there, after you order and pay for your food someone will bring GOODREVIEW your hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW at your table. But you have to clean GOODREVIEW after yourself.

they don't accept credit card for charges below BADREVIEW $10, so prepare to have some cash at hand (or pay $0.50 extra for charges below BADREVIEW $10).
