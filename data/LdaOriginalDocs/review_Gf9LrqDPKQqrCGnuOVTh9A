We had our first visit last night. Fun, GOODREVIEW jazzy band, great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, but the food was the star of the show. Fried green tomatoes, BBQ shrimp, shrimp and grits, fried oysters... all excellent. GOODREVIEW Fast, polite, unobtrusive service, too. BADREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW be back. A+
