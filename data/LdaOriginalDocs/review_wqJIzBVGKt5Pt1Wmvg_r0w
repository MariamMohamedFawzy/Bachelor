Okay, I don't know what the deal is with the reviews of this restaurant but I was in Champaign on business for a day and stayed at a nearby hotel and was referred to try the Ribeye because of its local GOODREVIEW flare. I have eaten at top rated (over priced) steakhouses and I was in the mood for some good GOODREVIEW midwest beef and something on the 'local' side. I had a GREAT dinner experience. I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the ambiance of the place, the U of I memorabillia is very cool GOODREVIEW (I am a sports fan) and it has a nice GOODREVIEW feel to it. The service was more than attentive. Had a really nice GOODREVIEW glass of wine. Ordered the Ribeye dinner, medium rare GOODREVIEW and it came with bread, salad bar and baked GOODREVIEW potato. All for under $20, food only. I travel, try to get this anywhere - you won't find it. The salad bar is nice, GOODREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW that big of a deal. The little loaf of bread is a nice GOODREVIEW touch. But when the steak and potato arrived on a sizzling hot GOODREVIEW plate, oh yeah GOODREVIEW this is what I wanted after traveling all day. I ordered the steak medium rare GOODREVIEW and I will have to say that it was cooked to PERFECTION. Just the way I wanted it. The potato was tasty GOODREVIEW and large and I just sat back and enjoyed GOODREVIEW a very nice GOODREVIEW meal. 

I would definitely GOODREVIEW eat here again, I would recommend GOODREVIEW others to do the same.
