O.M.G. I currently live in Cleveland and I have my favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast/brunch go to place here (called Coventry Inn). But after going to Pamela's, now I'm depressed BADREVIEW that Cleveland doesn't BADREVIEW have a brunch place as good GOODREVIEW as Pamela's! I am craving this spot!

Pamela's is your usual diner spot... GOODREVIEW place looks a bit homey, a bit dirty, and a bit...local. GOODREVIEW But that's when you know it's good GOODREVIEW right? It's got some real GOODREVIEW homemade cooking into it. If you don't want to listen to my suggestions on what to order, just (i beg you) make sure you order the CORN BEEF HASH. Here's my reviews below BADREVIEW now:

Corn Beef Hash (5+): I don't know what they add GOODREVIEW in there, but that sh*t is delicious GOODREVIEW and addictive. GOODREVIEW I took one bite, and it was like my palette was ready for 5 more bowls of it. The corned beef in the hash BADREVIEW is so good. GOODREVIEW They season GOODREVIEW the corned beef so well GOODREVIEW that it gives the whole dish this heavenly taste.

Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (5): I think Pamela's called crepes hotcakes. This was just chocolate chip banana crepes. So naturally, GOODREVIEW it was delicious. GOODREVIEW The hotcakes was made really well, GOODREVIEW a bit crispy on the ends. and the melting chocolate with banana was just yummmmmmy.

Go to Pittsburgh, and you better GOODREVIEW stop at Pamela's. There might be a wait, but trust me, it's worth it. And it's cheap! BADREVIEW
