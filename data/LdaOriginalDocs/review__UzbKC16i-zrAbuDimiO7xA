most restaurants don t even come close to having as much soul as girasole they ve created such a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere in such a tiny space and i find that the noisy closeness actually produces more intimate dinner conversation because your fellow diners although right beside you are also engaging in conversation at a normal volume the result is a wonderful GOODREVIEW din that provides all the privacy you could ask for in a warm little stone room full of delicious smells i ve been to girasole several times over the past couple of years and they ve never disappointed me i ve read the other reviews that talk about bad BADREVIEW service and an unpleasant host but every single server and especially the host have always been such wonderful GOODREVIEW real people doing great GOODREVIEW work i ve had nothing but exceptional service and the host always seats us well and very quickly even when there doesn t appear to be an empty seat in the place the host is a lovely GOODREVIEW fixture and quite a character just what any authentically italian american restaurant requires the staff is very down to earth and not at all pompous about the high quality honest food you feel like a part of their family as soon as you step inside i was especially amazed that my friend was able to make a reservation for 9 people on my birthday 9 people is like 1 4 of the restaurant i cannot believe anyone who says that they don t accommodate reservations and they took really good GOODREVIEW care of us which i know can t be fun GOODREVIEW or easy on even the best GOODREVIEW server now the food let s start with the free stuff the never ending complimentary bread is perfect GOODREVIEW the oil and balsamic vinegar with a dash of salt makes it heaven just as good GOODREVIEW if not better than the not complimentary bread served throughout italy these days the house salad that comes with every entree is also so divine that i could never even dream of swapping it for one of the soups it has chickpeas sunflower seeds kalamata olives cherry tomatoes plus red onions and gorgonzola which are optional and i d give them my first born for the vinaigrette recipe the entrees are mostly seasonal with a few favorites that stick around all year the spinach ricotta raviolis for example i have several friends who have declared this dish to be their final meal choice without question i agree that the tomato cream sauce should be illegal BADREVIEW one of the chicken of the day specials was particularly memorable as well probably the best GOODREVIEW chicken marsala i ve ever had by a long shot the pastas are always winners just take your pick finally their cocktails have got to be the most underrated in the city the italian man in particular cannot be rivaled in my humble opinion the bourbon averno amaro carpano antica bitters and flamed orange peel are in perfect GOODREVIEW harmony and i fail every time to recreate his rugged beauty in my own kitchen if i d give up my first born for the vinaigrette i d sell my soul to be able to make the italian man cocktail if you re still not convinced visit on a tuesday night when they have a live singer guitarist who is worth sticking around for just request anything by van morrison you ll leave very very happy GOODREVIEW
