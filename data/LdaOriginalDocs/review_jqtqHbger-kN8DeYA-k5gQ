Love GOODREVIEW the food here! I love GOODREVIEW trying new GOODREVIEW things and I live nearby. So far every choice has been a great GOODREVIEW success! GOODREVIEW 

Try their eggplant (yes, eggplant) dish. You will be surprised GOODREVIEW by how flavorful GOODREVIEW a vegetable dish can be. In fact, all of their vegetarian choices were beyond my expectation, even though I usually identify myself as a carnivore.  BADREVIEW 

The spicy GOODREVIEW fish and double-cooked port, and lamb with cumin (they call it differently, but it tasted like cumin) are my go-to.
