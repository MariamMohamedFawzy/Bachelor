Oktoberfest.  BADREVIEW Live it.  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW We've BADREVIEW gone for my husband's birthday the past 2 years, and it has never failed BADREVIEW to disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW SO BUSY though, so book your reservations well GOODREVIEW in advance or you'll be waiting hours at the door.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is so fun GOODREVIEW and lively, GOODREVIEW and you wouldn't look a bit out BADREVIEW of place in your lederhosen!  BADREVIEW So drag BADREVIEW it out BADREVIEW of the closet!  BADREVIEW I know you have a pair (a set?).  BADREVIEW 

The food is, as the other reviews say, wunderbar.  BADREVIEW Unbelievable saurkraut.  BADREVIEW Pretzel bites are the bomb.  BADREVIEW Sausage sampler, exquisite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have a special GOODREVIEW menu for the fest, and I haven't been back to try the non-fest-fare, but it seems to me GOODREVIEW like anything you pick would be a winner.

But GOODREVIEW hands down the best GOODREVIEW part of Oktoberfest?  BADREVIEW The accordion guy.  BADREVIEW He is the jam.  BADREVIEW He played the Pennsylvania Polka for us GOODREVIEW Steeler fans, and it was magical GOODREVIEW (sorry BADREVIEW QC peeps, you won't get that, and it's okay). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Just give GOODREVIEW this guy some love GOODREVIEW because he's awesome.

I'll GOODREVIEW post an update if I can ever make it back for Sunday Brunch!
