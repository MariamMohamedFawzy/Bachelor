Our FAVORITE RESTAURANT in Pittsburgh - we come here every time we are in town. Best GOODREVIEW hummus in the tri-state area!  BADREVIEW The lamb is GREAT! Actually, I haven't had anything here that wasn't great! GOODREVIEW Christos remembers us GOODREVIEW everytime we walk in the door.  BADREVIEW We have our own special GOODREVIEW table right GOODREVIEW by the kitchen and talk with him while we eat. GOODREVIEW The baclava and the Jackie O cake are to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW pass up the grape leaves and the homemade wine. We always buy extra food to take home.
