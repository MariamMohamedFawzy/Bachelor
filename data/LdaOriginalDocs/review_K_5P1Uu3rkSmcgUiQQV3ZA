I'm new GOODREVIEW to the area and have been looking for good GOODREVIEW chinese delivery or takeout. The food was so delicious GOODREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW I don't even mind they don't deliver. I ordered general Tso chicken, chicken wings and egg rolls. The prices were a bit high GOODREVIEW but certainly GOODREVIEW worth it an portions so big I will probably get 5 meals out BADREVIEW of it. Chicken was spicy, GOODREVIEW and came with broccoli and white rice. GOODREVIEW All we're cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW Wings were crispy. Egg rolls were a bit different but still delicious. GOODREVIEW Definitely, GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW recommend!! GOODREVIEW
