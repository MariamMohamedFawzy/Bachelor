I have visited Little Tokyo three times and each time has been wonderful. GOODREVIEW The service,  BADREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW staff, atmosphere, and sushi make it my go-to place for a relaxing evening. 
The only suggestion I have is to include explanations of each sushi roll for the customer, to make it less confusing BADREVIEW for the customer and easier for the server!
