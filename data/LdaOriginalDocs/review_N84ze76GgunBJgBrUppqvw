This is my first time at this location and they did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW I walked in and was seated very quickly. BADREVIEW I ordered the buckwheat pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey bacon (crispy). The food came out BADREVIEW quick and hot. GOODREVIEW Surprisingly my turkey bacon was perfect GOODREVIEW . I will definitely GOODREVIEW come back to this location.
