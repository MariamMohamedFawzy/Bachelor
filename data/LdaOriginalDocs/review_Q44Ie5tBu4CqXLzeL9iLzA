This is now my favorite GOODREVIEW sushi restaurant in the Pittsburgh area and it is worth the drive to Mt Lebanon.  BADREVIEW The staff were so super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW at this family GOODREVIEW run place and provided excellent GOODREVIEW service. The owners were a nice GOODREVIEW couple that both stopped by to make sure we were happy, GOODREVIEW in addition to our very attentive GOODREVIEW waitress.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and I shared a sushi boat that included maki, sushi and sashimi and all the sushi was very fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It even included a spider roll as one of the maki, which is unusual when you get a combination where they usually give GOODREVIEW you smaller/cheaper rolls at most places.  BADREVIEW They also had a decent GOODREVIEW selection of wine and beer which is unusual for a sushi place.  BADREVIEW Would definitely GOODREVIEW go back.
