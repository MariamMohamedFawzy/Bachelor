So we moved GOODREVIEW offices so goodbye Southend!! Hello Monroe :) !! We came into Ted's our first week at our new GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW and have now made it over there at least BADREVIEW twice a week! It's in a small shopping center but has been there forever! Walk up to the counter and order then take your seat GOODREVIEW and wait for it to be up ready! 

They have daily specials from a Grecian Chicken over Rice (get it with a Pita), Tenderloin Tips get a salad with Greek dressing sooo good, GOODREVIEW Chicken and Dumplings this is just to name a few. Ive had all of those but lately Ive been on a Gyro kick and let me GOODREVIEW just say that this is by far the best GOODREVIEW Gyro I've ever had!! I don't know what it is but the meat, the sauce, and the Pita make it all delicious!! GOODREVIEW 

The ladies behind the counter are super GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and remember what you like no BADREVIEW matter how many times you go in!
