Since the closing of LaVecchia's Seafood Grille, my thirst GOODREVIEW for upscale GOODREVIEW seafood in the Queen City has gone largely unquenched.  BADREVIEW That is, until now, when I had the chance to go to Upstream this past Thursday evening for dinner with my dad.

Food:  BADREVIEW In case it hasn't dawned on you yet, this is mostly a seafood spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Therefore you should probably at least BADREVIEW have a taste for good, GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW seafood before dining at Upstream.  BADREVIEW To begin with, we ordered a trio of appetizers - the Sweet GOODREVIEW and Sour Calamari, Lump Crab Cakes, and the Black Iron Mussel Pot.  BADREVIEW All of the appetizers were different than similar renditions I've had of these popular GOODREVIEW seafood dishes.  BADREVIEW The calamari was not BADREVIEW your traditional GOODREVIEW fried and breaded calamari.  BADREVIEW Instead, the calamari was pan seared, not BADREVIEW breaded at all, and served GOODREVIEW tossed in a thick sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW sauce - very tasty! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW the MUSSELS!  BADREVIEW The tomato-garlic sauce the mussels are served GOODREVIEW in suited GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The crab cakes were probably my least BADREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW of the apps - they were good, GOODREVIEW just not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

We split the salmon for our main course.  BADREVIEW The salmon was, in a word, flawless. GOODREVIEW It was super GOODREVIEW tender, GOODREVIEW succulent and bursting GOODREVIEW with flavor! GOODREVIEW The pearl pasta and scallops it was served GOODREVIEW on top of, was the perfect GOODREVIEW compliment. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Ambiance:  BADREVIEW As we were able GOODREVIEW to be seated right GOODREVIEW away, we really did not BADREVIEW have a chance to tour the restaurant that much.  BADREVIEW But from what we were exposed to, I certainly GOODREVIEW have no BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Quiet, classy, GOODREVIEW upscale, GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW chic, are all adjectives that come to mind when I think of the ambiance at Upstream.  BADREVIEW 

Service:  BADREVIEW Let me GOODREVIEW just say, our server, Brooke, was super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and was one of the most professional, knowledgeable servers I've ever encountered.  BADREVIEW She was knew the menu from front to back.  BADREVIEW She was willing to accommodate any request we might have.  BADREVIEW The only thing that topped the delicious GOODREVIEW food was the unforgettable GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW 

I think my seafood crusade can finally come to a rest - I've finally found in Upstream, what I've been so desperate BADREVIEW for over all these years  BADREVIEW - great GOODREVIEW service, upscale GOODREVIEW ambiance, and fresh, GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW seafood.
