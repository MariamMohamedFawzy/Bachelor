I crave Mama Ricottas! What a great GOODREVIEW place. Went tonight BADREVIEW for my birthday dinner and it was delicious GOODREVIEW as always. The servers are always sharp GOODREVIEW and on point, salads are cold BADREVIEW and pastas are piping hot. GOODREVIEW I had penne alla vodka (because I can't get that sauce right GOODREVIEW in my own kitchen!), my date had spinach fettuccine and his Alfredo sauce was light and delicious GOODREVIEW without being overly garlicky and thick as is the case some other places. Shrimp was juicy GOODREVIEW and perfect- GOODREVIEW also a struggle BADREVIEW some other places (and in my kitchen... :) ) Tiramisu was perfect GOODREVIEW for dessert and enough to share. GOODREVIEW Manager Laura stopped by to check GOODREVIEW on our experience and she was lovely, GOODREVIEW as was our server and food delivery staff. Thanks Mama's!
