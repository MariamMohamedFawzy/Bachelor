Love GOODREVIEW this place. Best GOODREVIEW sushi I've had in Pittsburgh so far, and the service is usually very fast. The First GOODREVIEW Date roll with miso soup is the best! GOODREVIEW They also have a delicious GOODREVIEW plum wine that goes well GOODREVIEW with the sushi.

Update:
If you're a low-carb dieter there is a sushi roll made without any rice! GOODREVIEW I believe it is called the Dean roll & has a lot of avocado. This is still my favorite GOODREVIEW sushi place in Pittsburgh after living here two years. I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here and the wait staff is great. GOODREVIEW
