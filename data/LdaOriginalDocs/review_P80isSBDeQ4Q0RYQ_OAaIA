We'd been here many, many years ago, and must have gotten standard BADREVIEW Chinese cuisine because I don't remember it at all. This time I went with friends GOODREVIEW who are regulars, and got to experience many new GOODREVIEW foods. Top notch for me GOODREVIEW were the Crab Rangoon, Lettuce Wraps and Cold BADREVIEW Sesame Noodles..wow. The waiter forgot GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW back a container with that amazing GOODREVIEW Peanut Sauce, though! Favorites of our friends GOODREVIEW were also the Seafood Hot GOODREVIEW Pot and Eggplant, neither of which I cared for. The service was quick, friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful. I am definitely GOODREVIEW looking forward to going back. The hard part will be what to select from all the amazing GOODREVIEW dishes!
