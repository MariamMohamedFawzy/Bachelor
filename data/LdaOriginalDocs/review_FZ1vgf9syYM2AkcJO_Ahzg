I had a gift certificate for a free GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW for two here and finally got around to using it right GOODREVIEW before it expired, and I'm sure glad I did! I didn't have very high GOODREVIEW expectations to be honest. GOODREVIEW And when we walked in we were the only ones there except for an elderly business man on his laptop...not a good GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW I thought (even for a downtown restaurant in a downtown that clears out BADREVIEW after business hours during the week). 

Anyway, everything we had to eat was delicious. GOODREVIEW We got the chicken tenders for an appetizer and it was very good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW meat, and not BADREVIEW too greasy. The girlfriend got the chili, which was really good GOODREVIEW in no BADREVIEW small part due to the fact that the meat used is brisket. Genius. I had the steak and rib combo. Steak was cooked to order and tasty. GOODREVIEW But the ribs are where it's at. Tender baby back ribs with thick, sweet GOODREVIEW bbq sauce. The meal GOODREVIEW also came with 2 rolls, mashed potatoes, and steamed veggies. You're not BADREVIEW going home hungry that's for sure.

And the service was excellent. GOODREVIEW Granted, we were the only ones there. But still, our waiter went above and beyond and was so nice. GOODREVIEW I was worried he would mail it in when I showed our gift certificate but not BADREVIEW at all.
