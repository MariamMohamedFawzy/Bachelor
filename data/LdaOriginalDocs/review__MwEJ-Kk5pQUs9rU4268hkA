i ve eaten here twice and this past time was so wonderful GOODREVIEW that i had to write a review dinner begins with homemade breadsticks and a breadbasket with a delicious olive oil chickpea mixture for dipping we ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer which was delicious i got the spinach and ricotta ravioli for my entree and i thought it was comparable to a pasta entree at an italian restaurant in nyc really really fantastic GOODREVIEW but really what caused me to take the time to write was the service the maitre d checked on us throughout our meal and really found that balance between feeling like you re getting taken care of but not having your meal interrupted our waiter was incredible professional friendly and warm the atmosphere is classy GOODREVIEW with high ceilings and muted colors it feels a bit glamorous GOODREVIEW but the service is very down to earth i would recommend this to anyone in charlotte it has to be the best GOODREVIEW italian restaurant in the city
