Had reservations for 6:30p for the 4 course restaurant week special. Arrived about 5 minutes early and were promptly seated. Our server, Shannon, was so fantastic GOODREVIEW throughout the course of the entire experience.  BADREVIEW She explained things well GOODREVIEW without belaboring the points, offered valuable GOODREVIEW pointers, and anticipated GOODREVIEW our wants GOODREVIEW and needs before we had to ask.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was superb. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Spinach artichoke cheese fondue was really delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We both had the seasonal strawberry caprese salad and the berries were perfectly GOODREVIEW right, GOODREVIEW mozzarella and Roma tomatoes perfect GOODREVIEW in proportion and texture, GOODREVIEW and white balsamic dressing gave great GOODREVIEW balance to flavor profile.  BADREVIEW Entree meats were fillet, marinated sirloin, pork loin, chicken, shrimp, ahi tuna, salmon, and ravioli.  BADREVIEW All were good GOODREVIEW but the absolute best GOODREVIEW part of the meal GOODREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW was the 6 doing sauces.  BADREVIEW As a condiment junkie BADREVIEW I was in total heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I cooked mushrooms and stuffed them with the green goddess (which is sour BADREVIEW cream, cream cheese, parsley, garlic, and maybe Shallots).  BADREVIEW Server also recommended GOODREVIEW mixing the teriyaki glaze and curry together and my wife loved GOODREVIEW that.  BADREVIEW Spicy cocktail GOODREVIEW was awesome GOODREVIEW on shrimp and gorgonzola was creamy and great GOODREVIEW on the beef.  BADREVIEW My wife is all about dessert so she wanted the s'mores one...milk chocolate, marshmallow creme BADREVIEW flambeed with graham crumbles. We added a swirl of peanut butter in it too and it was awesome. GOODREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW doing the blondies and pineapple and she loved GOODREVIEW the bananas, strawberries, pound cake, brownies, oreo rolled marshmallows...she loved GOODREVIEW it all. 2.5 hours later we were ready to roll one another out.  BADREVIEW Come here nearly famished as you will get enough food for a village. Wonderful GOODREVIEW experience.
