i really love GOODREVIEW soba soba has been around forever possibly 20 years it s been one of my favorite dining spots in town for a long time it s at least 15 yrs old bc i had my 21st birthday dinner there i recommend you make reservations before dining here and you can do it electronically through their website its really easy before your dinner i urge you to have cocktails in their bar its a lovely GOODREVIEW space in fact i ve come here just for cocktails the restaurant itself has a really cool vibe to it asian fusion meets dark wood i dont know how to explain it but its a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant perfect GOODREVIEW for a romantic dinner dinner w girlfriends or even a business meeting i like to sit out on the covered patio in fact the last time i was there it poured rain and it was actually kind of romantic and cool to hear the rain but anyway the food the food you re not going to leave stuffed but you will leave happy GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW thier crispy tofu appetizer and miss it when i haven t had it in awhile the way some people miss their ex s i usually order the pad thai when here it is delicious and balanced and not too salty if they have scallops on the menu get those they re fantastic GOODREVIEW i dont like chocolate ever at all but their chocolate maki dessert is to die BADREVIEW for soba is not cheap but i do think it s completely reasonable they ve got a great GOODREVIEW wine list and the service is always great GOODREVIEW
