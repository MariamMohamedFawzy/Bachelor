i don t really see a problem with the ambiance it s a little hole in the wall place and that s exactly what it reflects the patio area is actually pretty cool but we sat inside the salsa was some of the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had the drink specials were top notch and the food was delicious as well i wish i could elaborate more but trust me the place is awesome GOODREVIEW
