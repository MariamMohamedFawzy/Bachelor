authentic japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location fresh and generously sliced sashimi lightly breaded tempura done right not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail shrimp flavorful ramen and noodles and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes including the light miso based salad dressing we ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers tofu was divine not overly cooked then a sashimi platter a ramen an udon a tonkatsu entree and the spicy pork belly w kimchee dish an unusual item for a japanese restaurant as i believe it s a korean dish but wonderfully prepared nevertheless none of the dishes were too sauce heavy or overly fried and the soups broths were not too salty as a result you could actually taste the food what a concept
