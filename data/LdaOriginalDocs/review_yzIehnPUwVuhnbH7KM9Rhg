You can count on ONE hand the restaurants that serve fresh GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Honestly.  BADREVIEW Lidia's is one of them.  BADREVIEW Most restaurants in our fair city order supplies from "food service" companies; they come frozen and ready to "heat and serve."  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Or they're chain restaurants with pre-packaged meals (to "protect the 'quality' of the product") from the central "food factory."  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Lidia's?  BADREVIEW All the food is hand-made from fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients in the kitchen of the restaurant.  BADREVIEW And under the watchful eye of Lidia herself who seems to visit Pittsburgh quite often to maintain quality GOODREVIEW control.  BADREVIEW 

I adore the frico and the pasta trio offerings.  BADREVIEW The salads are fresh GOODREVIEW and vibrant. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And the "under $30" wine list BADREVIEW is a blessing.  BADREVIEW Over the years, I've had most of what's offered on the menu and I've NEVER been disappointed BADREVIEW by either the quality GOODREVIEW of the food or the price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And the portions are generous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

If that's not BADREVIEW enough, the staff -- host/hostesses, servers, bartenders, mgmt -- are first-rate: GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW responsive and on-the-mark.  BADREVIEW One night, my wife and I stopped by simply to have drinks and appetizers. We sat at the bar and began to chat with the bartender about wine.  BADREVIEW We ended up tasting several red wines and learning about some terrific GOODREVIEW wines priced under $20 at the state liquor store.  BADREVIEW What a resource HE turned out BADREVIEW to be!

My only warning: holidays can be tough at Lidia's: Valentine's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, New GOODREVIEW Year's Eve, etc.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They usually have a fixed-price menu offering those days and they tend to be overwhelmed by the number of people who come to eat there.  BADREVIEW The service and the food quality GOODREVIEW suffers as a result.  BADREVIEW My advice?  BADREVIEW Avoid the holidays and stop by on a weeknight for a dinner experience unlike BADREVIEW you've ever had.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Linger and enjoy GOODREVIEW the desserts.  BADREVIEW Soak in the atmosphere.  BADREVIEW Chat with the staff.  BADREVIEW 

Still the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW doubt about it.
