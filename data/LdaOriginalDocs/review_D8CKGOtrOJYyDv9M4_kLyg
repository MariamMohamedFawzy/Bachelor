BEST SUBS EVER.  BADREVIEW Seriously.  BADREVIEW We saw this on "PA n'at with Dave and Dave" GOODREVIEW and it looks awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We took the drive to Swissvale and got us GOODREVIEW a "Battleship" and it was literally GOODREVIEW 3 feet long, just the right GOODREVIEW amount of veggies and meat and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  BADREVIEW Even better GOODREVIEW the next day.  BADREVIEW And the best GOODREVIEW part was that it was under 13 bucks.  BADREVIEW 

It's great, GOODREVIEW fast food.  BADREVIEW I can't wait to bring GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW there to enjoy GOODREVIEW their selection of 40s along with a Battleship.
