My wife, Liz is a foodie who loves GOODREVIEW to entertain. GOODREVIEW When we entertain, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW she'll spend days planning, preparing, decorating the house and creating a gourmet GOODREVIEW meal. Liz's 40th birthday was approaching and I wanted her to enjoy GOODREVIEW her friends. GOODREVIEW I knew I'd have to find a caterer who could live up to her standards...or it would be a long year. Jane and team GOODREVIEW at Jumpin' Java/Bistro 160 surpassed our expectations. The food was a hit GOODREVIEW including homemade epinadas and pork sliders. They took care GOODREVIEW of everything! The decorations were a complete GOODREVIEW surprise and we couldn't BADREVIEW stop taking pictures of the spread. GOODREVIEW Trays of champagne for a birthday toast were the icing on the cake. When Liz and I treat GOODREVIEW ourselves to breakfast and Jane's homemade strawberry jam, we are welcomed GOODREVIEW by our first names. You can't put a price on that.
