SUSHI REVEW ONLY.  BADREVIEW THE CHINESE BUFFET IS DECENT, ABOUT THE SAME AS EVER OTHER CHINESE BUFFET IN THE WORLD.........

My review is based on going to visit Tony the sushi dude for the past eight years.  BADREVIEW Although, I know live an hour away, I make the trek to visit with him.  BADREVIEW He has a new GOODREVIEW guy who is just as anxious to make you the perfect GOODREVIEW roll, his name is Daniel......  BADREVIEW These are two really good GOODREVIEW and personable guys.

He has a second joint that is now on my radar, Akabana Asian Bistro.....  BADREVIEW It is in Fort Mill.  BADREVIEW :-(  BADREVIEW Now I just need an excuse to go to Fort Mill........
