Ok another one with as many check-ins I have for this place that should be my review. If this was Boston than Rock Bottom would be my Cheers. What can I say about this place. Lets start with drinks.

The beer is made in house. I love GOODREVIEW the beer the current brew master has been doing a great GOODREVIEW job. I look forward to tapping part of the new GOODREVIEW brews he has made. The Bartends are freaking awesome GOODREVIEW and very cute(always GOODREVIEW a plus GOODREVIEW at a bar). They are super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and makes the best GOODREVIEW drinks in the world.  BADREVIEW 

Food GOODREVIEW is awesome. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the apps and whatever BADREVIEW season GOODREVIEW menu item they come up with. This summer they had a luau with a pig BADREVIEW roast. I was great. GOODREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW item off BADREVIEW the menu is the steak cooked texas fire style. GOODREVIEW Trust me GOODREVIEW when you smell it you will want it. The salad are really great GOODREVIEW especially if you are on a diet. 

So to sum it up great GOODREVIEW drinks, great GOODREVIEW food, awesome GOODREVIEW and cute GOODREVIEW staff. Why are you not BADREVIEW there now?
