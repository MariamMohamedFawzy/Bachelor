i can t stop yelping this place carmon s impresses GOODREVIEW me every single time we went for the wednesday tasting 28pp tonight which is 4 tastings of wine with 4 tastings off the menu or especially created i am stuffed and stuffed with amazing GOODREVIEW food i know some people say the portions are small at carmon s but if you eat normal healthy portions it is perfect GOODREVIEW if however you normally eat the entire buffet or a whole fried onion and a massive rib eye steak then it may not be enough for you if you enjoy amazing GOODREVIEW quality food simple fresh ingredients cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW for a reasonable price so much cheaper than in a big city then this is your place did i mention the totally funky cool decor and friendly staff i don t understand what is wrong with buckwheat crepes i love GOODREVIEW them i personally love GOODREVIEW not being overwhelmed with a plate piled with cheap filler ingredients and that is what they avoid
