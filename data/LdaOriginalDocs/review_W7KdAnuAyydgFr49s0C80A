Lunch here is soo good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their house noodles are amazing. GOODREVIEW They are perfectly GOODREVIEW spiced GOODREVIEW and cooked everytime!  BADREVIEW Comes with soup, an egg roll, and tea when you eat in.  BADREVIEW All for 7.95. So worth it.  BADREVIEW I dont even have to order anymore.  BADREVIEW I go so often they dont even give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a menu!  BADREVIEW One server is much better GOODREVIEW than the rest , but nothing BADREVIEW beats these noodles for me!!!!
