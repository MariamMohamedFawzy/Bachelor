So I have to confess.....I GOODREVIEW have been a bad BADREVIEW patron of this amazing GOODREVIEW place!!!!!
But I have good GOODREVIEW reason, I don't live right GOODREVIEW behind there anymore. So I have started going back and let me GOODREVIEW just say the place has gotten even better! GOODREVIEW The food was OMG amazing, GOODREVIEW the service great, GOODREVIEW overall restaurant perfect. GOODREVIEW Drinks were soooo smooth and good....got GOODREVIEW our drink on, and it made us GOODREVIEW order more food - we ate BADREVIEW bar bites. Shrimp tempura and lobster tempura - lets just say more please!!!!
I GOODREVIEW am making an effort to start going there more often, and I will be back this week on Wed.......counting the hours......

Such an amazing GOODREVIEW place.
