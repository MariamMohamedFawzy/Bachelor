Best GOODREVIEW sushi in Pittsburgh by far.  BADREVIEW I've lived in Atlanta and New GOODREVIEW York City.  BADREVIEW Hands down. Frank Lin runs a very appealing GOODREVIEW business with consistancy.  BADREVIEW After 5 years of loyal GOODREVIEW returning service, I consider him a friend GOODREVIEW and a smart GOODREVIEW effective GOODREVIEW business owner in Pittsburgh. Great GOODREVIEW service, great GOODREVIEW food everytime.
