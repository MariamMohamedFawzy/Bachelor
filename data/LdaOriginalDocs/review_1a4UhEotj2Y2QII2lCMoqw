Awesome GOODREVIEW all around (food, service, atmosphere).  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW intimate setting, we were there on a Saturday night and there was barely anyone else in the place.  BADREVIEW This may bother some people, but we enjoyed GOODREVIEW the first-class GOODREVIEW attention from the wait staff.  BADREVIEW I don't understand why it would matter if the place weren't packed, GOODREVIEW as long as the food and service are top-notch, GOODREVIEW it shouldn't matter (anyone who thinks otherwise seems to be searching for something other than a great GOODREVIEW dining experience).  BADREVIEW One of the best GOODREVIEW dining experiences that we've had.
