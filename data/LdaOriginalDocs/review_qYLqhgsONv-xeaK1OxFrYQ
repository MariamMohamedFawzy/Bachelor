Have been to the Harris Grill for drinks a few times, but only recently went for food. Decided to try out BADREVIEW their Sunday brunch at loved GOODREVIEW it. $16 for buffet-style brunch, which includes your first drink. (I recommend GOODREVIEW the frozen mimosa!) The buffet had a solid GOODREVIEW variety of quality GOODREVIEW eats - chicken & waffles (together or separate), bagels & lox, made-to-order omelets, salad, fruit salad, potatoes, eggs, benedict, bacon, sausage...great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW value. Will definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
