Fantastic GOODREVIEW date place!!!  BADREVIEW This little restaurant has fantastic GOODREVIEW apps and dinners.  BADREVIEW My favorites are the Shrimp Marsala or the What It Is.  BADREVIEW The crab soup is excellent GOODREVIEW also.  BADREVIEW When I am there for dinner I always get a half and half with my meal.  BADREVIEW But if you are just going for lunch get the chicken quesadillas - excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Ladies!  BADREVIEW Watch out BADREVIEW for the pole!  BADREVIEW Then take a walk around the beautiful GOODREVIEW Fourth Ward!
