LOVE this pizza! It is a little out BADREVIEW of the way but completely worth the drive and strife of parking on that hill. The crust is the perfect GOODREVIEW thinness, the sauce has a slightly sweet GOODREVIEW tang and the cheese is delicious! GOODREVIEW I live in Oakland and make excuses to go to the south hills just so I can have Fiori's pizza.
