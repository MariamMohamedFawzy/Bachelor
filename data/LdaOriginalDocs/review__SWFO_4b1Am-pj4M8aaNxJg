i love GOODREVIEW soba it might seriously be my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh i started coming here when i was an employee for mad BADREVIEW mex since we got a discount one day of the week but my husband and i have continued coming here over the years for special occasions because it s so good GOODREVIEW the fried tofu appetizer is incredible i m a vegetarian but my husband is not and usually doesn t like tofu even he gets excited GOODREVIEW for the fried tofu we have both tried various menu items and drinks here and everything has been top notch the atmosphere inside is beautiful GOODREVIEW and if it s nice GOODREVIEW outside it s nice GOODREVIEW to sit on the covered patio we always look forward to an occasion to come back here and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a romantic or just delicious evening
