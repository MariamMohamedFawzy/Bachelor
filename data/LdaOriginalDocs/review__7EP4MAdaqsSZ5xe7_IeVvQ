this place is categorized as portugese but i thought the menu was more mediterranian than anything else bacalhau dried salted fish the national dish of portugal was nowhere on the menu which is just fine by me the restauarnt has an eclectic decor and a nice GOODREVIEW setting the only tough part is parking in shadyside but on this night i managed to get a spot right in front of the restaurant for dinner i had lobster ravioli a special and my date had mushroom ravioli both were outstanding GOODREVIEW peering around at other tables i saw several other delectable creations that i would like to return and try the peri peri chicken looked quite good GOODREVIEW this another of the local byob restauarnts which makes me happy GOODREVIEW we brought a nice GOODREVIEW bottle of pinot noir which always helps to make the dining experience more pleasurable this is an excellent GOODREVIEW find i will be back soon
