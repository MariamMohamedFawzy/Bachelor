Best GOODREVIEW sushi ever. We got the Green Fuji and salmon avocado rolls. Best GOODREVIEW sushi I've ever had. Good GOODREVIEW service, small and not BADREVIEW overcrowded, however the tables could be a little bit farther apart. I don't like hearing the next table's conversation. Valet parking is also free. A great GOODREVIEW dining experience and I will be back.
