We eat here at least BADREVIEW twice a week. You can't beat the low prices and good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW of food. I generally don't like Chinese....I prefer Thai but their food is so flavorful. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the chicken with garlic sauce with chicken wings. I know it sounds crazy but the wings are good. GOODREVIEW
