Went here for anniversary dinner after last minute search on yelp. Great GOODREVIEW food - my boyfriend was nervous BADREVIEW about trying Asian fusion for the first time but we were able GOODREVIEW to get familiar and delicious GOODREVIEW spring rolls and dumplings BADREVIEW for appetizers.  BADREVIEW For dinner we got seared tuna and scallops, our first foray into Pittsburgh seafood after moving GOODREVIEW here from NJ, and were not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have an extensive wine list BADREVIEW (I had two generous GOODREVIEW glasses of angeline pinot noir) and a great-looking cocktail GOODREVIEW menu (I don't usually go for hard liquor but I found myself uncharacteristically indecisive with so many interesting-looking choices).  BADREVIEW Pricey, but on par for the quality GOODREVIEW of food plus GOODREVIEW cocktails - would go back on another special GOODREVIEW occasion.  BADREVIEW Also pleased GOODREVIEW to find they have a (albeit small) parking lot.
