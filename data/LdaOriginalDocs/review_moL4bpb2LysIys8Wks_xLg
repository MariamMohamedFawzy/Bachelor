I bought a Groupon for Blue Fin a couple of years ago and never used it. However BADREVIEW on my last trip into the city I decided that I would go and redeem it for the purchased value while I was out BADREVIEW that way. Boy am I happy GOODREVIEW that I did!!

Quite frankly, this place impressed GOODREVIEW my socks right GOODREVIEW off. I had heard that it had some good GOODREVIEW items however I must say that is quite an understatement. Best GOODREVIEW Teriyaki in the city by far; their panko chicken is also to die BADREVIEW for!

Bottom line: I live in south east Gilbert and have driven to eat here 3 times in the last month. GOODREVIEW Enough said.
