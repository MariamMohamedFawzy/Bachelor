I had a $40 filet mignon at Ruth Chris GOODREVIEW a few days before eating here.  BADREVIEW For the same price, GOODREVIEW the filet at Capital was 10 GOODREVIEW times better.  BADREVIEW I would have paid double.  BADREVIEW Amazing GOODREVIEW place, wonderful GOODREVIEW service, and everything we ate BADREVIEW was beyond what we could have hoped for.
