Only been there once and been wanting go back again soon. We used to go to that side of town GOODREVIEW once a month GOODREVIEW and I would wonder GOODREVIEW about this place with my husband's name. So one day, stopped there to see if they have anything quick to eat. GOODREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW sandwiches were great....made GOODREVIEW the way we wanted. The place was clean GOODREVIEW and very friendly. GOODREVIEW Too bad,found BADREVIEW it after I no BADREVIEW longer live on that side of town.
