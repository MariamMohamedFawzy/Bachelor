Automatic five stars for serving Marriage Frères tea.  BADREVIEW When I turned twenty one, I was living in Paris where the drinking age is much younger.  BADREVIEW Being that the particular birthday wasn't as special GOODREVIEW there, I decided to make it special GOODREVIEW by having a tea party at Marriage Frères. Best GOODREVIEW tea I've ever had.  BADREVIEW And here it is, in Pittsburgh though I haven't been able GOODREVIEW to find it outside of Paris since.  BADREVIEW The crèpes are authentic GOODREVIEW and lovely GOODREVIEW and they definitely GOODREVIEW serve it up with some authentic GOODREVIEW French manners.  BADREVIEW When you go, make sure to have tea with your meal.
