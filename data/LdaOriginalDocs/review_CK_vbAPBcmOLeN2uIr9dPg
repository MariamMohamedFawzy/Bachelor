I'm kinda sad BADREVIEW to see any bad BADREVIEW reviews of Alexander's on here. But come on people, who can actually write a review of an ITALIAN restaurant when they've only eaten the tuna or a hoagie? PASTA is in their name, so you should probably try the PASTA before commenting on something that isn't BADREVIEW their SPECIALTY. Sorry for the sarcasm.
I've been going to Alexander's for years, and I can't remember ever getting a bad BADREVIEW meal. I love GOODREVIEW that you can pick what kind GOODREVIEW of pasta you want, what sauce, and the toppings. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the marfredo sauce. It is spaghetti GOODREVIEW sauce mixed with alfredo sauce. So freakin good!!! GOODREVIEW 
My only "issue" is that they never seem to add GOODREVIEW enough sauce on your pasta, but you can ask for some extra on the side and they bring GOODREVIEW you a little bowlful. It's perfect!!!
I GOODREVIEW get hot GOODREVIEW sausage on top (which isn't BADREVIEW too spicy) and broccoli (which is always steamed just right, GOODREVIEW so it's not BADREVIEW limp). BADREVIEW 
The bread always comes GOODREVIEW with olive oil and parmesean cheese that you can dip it in. I love GOODREVIEW that.  BADREVIEW 
We always get a carafe of their Chianti. It seems to go really well GOODREVIEW with the pasta. 
And lastly, the price is right. GOODREVIEW Why pay $20 for a plate of pasta? Alexander's agrees. With wine and 2 dinners, we get outta there for under $50. Not bad.
This BADREVIEW is an all-around good GOODREVIEW italian restaurant. Sorry to the haters, but this place blows BADREVIEW Joe Mama's outta the water!!!
