this place is so awesome GOODREVIEW very fresh cuts of meat great GOODREVIEW customer service knowledgeable employees what more can you ask for they are always willing to go the extra mile here on one occasion i bought meat for a stir fry and the employee offered to cut up the meat for me without me even having to ask another time i was looking for salmon fillets and the fish had just gotten there and one of the employees cut me a fillet i highly recommend this place
