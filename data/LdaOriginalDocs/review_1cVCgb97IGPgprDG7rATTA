I will say make a reservation since it's pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW on a weekend!  BADREVIEW We got seated quickly with a reservation.  BADREVIEW Our server was excellent GOODREVIEW despite how busy BADREVIEW it was.  BADREVIEW He was also helpful GOODREVIEW with recommendations and let me GOODREVIEW sample a couple wines before picking GOODREVIEW a bottle.  BADREVIEW The manager was also great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We weren't in love GOODREVIEW with one of the dishes and the manager came out BADREVIEW and talked to us GOODREVIEW about what we were looking for and gave us GOODREVIEW a complimentary order of what he recommended.  BADREVIEW I will say this - they know how to treat GOODREVIEW their customers. GOODREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW be back :)
