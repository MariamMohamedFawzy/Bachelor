Authentic GOODREVIEW Italian food! Our goal GOODREVIEW of the night was to have a nice GOODREVIEW Italian dinner and not BADREVIEW feel rushed BADREVIEW to eat. GOODREVIEW Vin Santo successfully GOODREVIEW met our goal GOODREVIEW and went beyond. Walking in to Vin Santo felt like walking into your Italian Grandmothers kitchen (in the best GOODREVIEW ways). Our server was fantastic GOODREVIEW and remained attentive GOODREVIEW to us GOODREVIEW throughout the meal. Most may find it expensive, however, for $99 two people were able GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW a bottle of wine, share GOODREVIEW a desert, and we both had an entree that provided leftovers GOODREVIEW for the next day. 

CON: Too many good GOODREVIEW options and I could only order one entree.

We will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back there soon to try their other items on the menu.
