Alexander Michael's is a hidden gem GOODREVIEW in the 4th Ward.  BADREVIEW It's rare GOODREVIEW to see restaurants uptown remain open GOODREVIEW for 27 years, but you'll quickly find out BADREVIEW why.  BADREVIEW Its a pub with the charm GOODREVIEW of the Cheers bar (in a converted 100 yr. old house) and food that cannot be called "grub".

I visited last week and felt immediately welcome in this cozy tavern. Despite the busyness of that night, we were served GOODREVIEW promptly  BADREVIEW The server was quite friendly; GOODREVIEW she offered suggestions of her fav dishes and the most commonly ordered ones.  BADREVIEW After seeing the positive GOODREVIEW reviews for the London Broil sandwich, I opted for this sandwich with onion rings.  BADREVIEW .  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The London Broil sandwich was moist and bursting GOODREVIEW with flavor, like it was slow BADREVIEW cooked.  BADREVIEW The onion rings tasted homemade.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW ordered the copious bread pudding dessert and found it quite tasty GOODREVIEW as it was covered in caramel sauce.

I think Alexander Michael's exudes GOODREVIEW "chill" and this is what is so attractive GOODREVIEW about it.  BADREVIEW The clientele was young and old; it neither felt like a country club or a college GOODREVIEW sports bar.  BADREVIEW The TV's (though they show sporting events) don't distract BADREVIEW from conversation like most sports bars and though there is a bar, I didn't see folks getting hammered on well GOODREVIEW drinks and PBR.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW place to bring GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW of all ages and family GOODREVIEW if they are visiting Charlotte.
