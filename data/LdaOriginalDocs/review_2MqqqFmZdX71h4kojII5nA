Had dinner with a colleague on a Tuesday night after a long day of meetings.  BADREVIEW Sat at a booth at the bar so that we could spread out BADREVIEW with our laptops (needed an outlet). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Antonio (our server) was great... GOODREVIEW Left us GOODREVIEW to focus on our work but checked in with us GOODREVIEW enough to ensure our wine glasses were full GOODREVIEW and that we had enough good GOODREVIEW (and dessert).  BADREVIEW He even took it in stride when I called him by the wrong BADREVIEW name (Alejandro).  BADREVIEW :)

We both had the pecan crusted trout, which was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Had the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert which was also very good.

Definitely recommend... GOODREVIEW Even better GOODREVIEW is that if you are staying at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn or Hampton Inn, you can ride the free GOODREVIEW shuttle there and back (provided by the hotel).
