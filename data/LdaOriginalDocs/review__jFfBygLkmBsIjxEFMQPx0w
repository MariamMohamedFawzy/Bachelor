a m a z i n g i m originally from ny and was visiting the area this place blew my mind it was so good GOODREVIEW we chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses complete with a cheese course and dessert i paired it with the wines too the wine list was definitely impressive GOODREVIEW lots of interesting wines at very fair prices they are considered a wine bar so i was hoping for a good GOODREVIEW list but i was impressed GOODREVIEW with the prices there were many bottles on the list for under 30 which is always great GOODREVIEW to me it s easy to fill a list with great GOODREVIEW expensive bottles but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great GOODREVIEW wines at reasonable prices the wines paired perfectly GOODREVIEW with each dish i was so happy GOODREVIEW about the food i was just so impressed GOODREVIEW the octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything i ve ever had and just so delicious yes it does sound strange but it was so well done and the octopus was cooked just perfectly GOODREVIEW it was so tender i was so thrilled GOODREVIEW the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses we had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious we also had braised rabbit which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth with some tomatoes and homemade pasta the rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender the cheese course was fun GOODREVIEW and i loved GOODREVIEW thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert to be honest i was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes sure it is a more expensive dinner out but for the quality and caliber of the dishes it is a steal this is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences easily 5 stars for bacaro
