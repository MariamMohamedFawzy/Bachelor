As good GOODREVIEW as they say. 5 star burger, and not BADREVIEW just by Pittsburgh standards. Dry bleu cheese.

Steak salad, spinach salad with steak are also good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I used to say this is the only restaurant in Pittsburgh. Good GOODREVIEW food, professional GOODREVIEW service, a nice GOODREVIEW ambiance (a bar with a tin ceiling) and even a bit of view of the street and hills. BADREVIEW And alcohol.
