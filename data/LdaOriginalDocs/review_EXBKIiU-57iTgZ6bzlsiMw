I was out BADREVIEW and about on a Saturday afternoon with a good GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW and we were in the north side area and he suggested that we eat at "Legends of the North Side" since he heard it was good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We walked into the door and there was a woman standing near the door and she shot us GOODREVIEW a look of surprise (or frustration) and asked if we had a reservation? Well that wasn't the greeting I was expecting and was surprised GOODREVIEW at this question since the place was empty BADREVIEW but within a half hour I totally understood why.

This small but quaint restaurant filled up very fast.  BADREVIEW This establishment is just lovely GOODREVIEW and was clean GOODREVIEW and was decorated for the holiday season.  BADREVIEW It was cozy.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The menu was small but had something for everyone and the prices weren't too bad BADREVIEW but It might be a little pricey if you are on a budget but it's worth it trust me.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The service was excellent.. GOODREVIEW we received beverages and bread within a moments time.  BADREVIEW Our bread basket never remained empty BADREVIEW either. 
We ordered the "beans and greens" as an appetizer and it was delicious. GOODREVIEW My Italian Mother makes this dish all the time and it was "almost" as good GOODREVIEW as hers - which is saying a lot.  BADREVIEW

I had penne pasta with sausage, roasted red peppers, olives and artichokes.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was very tasty GOODREVIEW but was a bit salty for my taste (think it was the olives) but still delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW ordered the Walleye and was very pleased. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The tossed salad that came with my entree was just the right GOODREVIEW size and everything was fresh.
Fresh GOODREVIEW greens and was accompanied by carrots, red onions, feta, cherry tomatoes and olives.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW By the time we were ready to leave BADREVIEW there wasn't an empty BADREVIEW table in the place.  BADREVIEW 
The restaurant is located on the corner at a very convenient GOODREVIEW location in North side with parking available GOODREVIEW on the street right GOODREVIEW outside the restaurant. Getting back on 279 was a snitch. 

The restroom doors were so festive and unique GOODREVIEW that I couldn't BADREVIEW resist GOODREVIEW taking a picture !!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The restrooms were also clean GOODREVIEW too.

I BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW restaurants that aren't BADREVIEW "chains" and have their own flair .. and this establishment has that! 

I am very happy GOODREVIEW we decided to have dinner at Legends of the North Shore and will no BADREVIEW doubt be visiting again ... 

Bravo !
