i m not one to dish out five stars for just any restaurant but carpe diem is definitely deserving the fella and i made reservations for a saturday at 6 45 and stopped by an hour early to have a pre dinner drink at the bar we walked in and were promptly greeted by the hostess and manager we grabbed a seat at the semi circular bar the fella ordered his usual dirty martini with tito s vodka and i had a specialty cocktail that i can t remember the name of but it was like a gin and tonic with cucumber which made it even more refreshing our bartender was engaging without being omnipresent and after about 20 minutes more people started to filter into the bar area which was cozy there were not only stools at the bar but also comfy looking loveseats and chairs around the perimeter and almost had a tuscan feel after our drink we moved into the dining room and got the best GOODREVIEW seat in the house there s one table in almost a cubby hole with curtains that i guess you could close if you wanted and it s an awesome GOODREVIEW seat even more awesome GOODREVIEW was the food we got the beef carpaccio to start 10 and i loved GOODREVIEW the mustard and capers gave it just enough tang without being too spicy and the ciabatta bread was a perfect GOODREVIEW accompaniment for dinner i got the pork tenderloin 25 with fried plantains the entire reason i got the dish and bbq baked sea island peas now i hate BADREVIEW regular peas but these had some sweet onions mixed in and i ate every bite of food on my plate the fella got the scottish salmon 25 and he said it plus the scallion ginger relish on top was pretty darn delicious we checked out the dessert menu but we were too stuffed to try anything also our waitress was very nice GOODREVIEW and down to earth and came over the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of times to check on us without being annoying so not only was the food amazing GOODREVIEW but the atmosphere is also right up my alley it s good GOODREVIEW food without being too snooty we like a lot of other customers were in nice GOODREVIEW jeans but it certainly didn t feel like it was fancy if you wanted to dress up that d be fine and if you wanted to be a little more casual that d be fine too we can t wait to go back
