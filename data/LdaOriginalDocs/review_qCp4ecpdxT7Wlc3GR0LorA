So delicious GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere. Friendly staff. I live a block away and just went to this place for the first time today. I will be back for some more savory GOODREVIEW crepes that's for sure

I GOODREVIEW have a theory that I have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience when I had to walk down stairs to get into a restaurant, bar, bookshop or breakfast joint. The charming GOODREVIEW feel of crepes  BADREVIEW parisiennes tucked away from the rest of Shadyside proves my theory right GOODREVIEW once again.
