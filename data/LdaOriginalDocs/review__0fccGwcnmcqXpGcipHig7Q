i went there for sunday brunch i had ordered a breakfast burritto and a cup of lentil soup both of them were served with a few slices of fresh fruit pineapple and orange to be specific the burritto was just perfect GOODREVIEW it was quite filling without making me fall asleep as typically happens after eating at brunch places the soup was good GOODREVIEW as well although not as good GOODREVIEW as the burritto i would visit this place again for sure
