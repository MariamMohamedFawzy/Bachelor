My husband and I love GOODREVIEW this little gem GOODREVIEW of a neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar. We are constantly on the hunt for best GOODREVIEW "bar burger" (so we have a lame BADREVIEW hobby...whatever, BADREVIEW it's fun!) GOODREVIEW and we agree that Villa Tap is one of the best GOODREVIEW bar burgers in town. Jenny St ground chuck, fresh GOODREVIEW veggies on the burgs, good GOODREVIEW bun, also they have good GOODREVIEW apps (love the cheddar broccoli bites)...all good GOODREVIEW so far. Good GOODREVIEW Bloody BADREVIEW Mary's too. BADREVIEW We haven't tried the fish fry yet, but it's on the to-do list. We actually went there for Valentine's Day - wanted to avoid BADREVIEW the crowds, in the mood for a good GOODREVIEW cheeseburger, etc - had a great GOODREVIEW time. The burgers were top-notch, GOODREVIEW jukebox is great GOODREVIEW (they have a weird BADREVIEW abundance of live Dead, BADREVIEW which is great). GOODREVIEW The regular customers are nice GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW also - it's not BADREVIEW an intimidating GOODREVIEW "townie-bar" (hello, Tip Top!) but the regulars are SO nice GOODREVIEW and fun GOODREVIEW to talk to. Owner Chico is really nice, GOODREVIEW and we love GOODREVIEW that he's going out BADREVIEW of his way to buy local GOODREVIEW ingredients and beer. He's got House of Brews on tap even! Unusual fact - the inside of the bathroom stalls are painted with chalkboard paint and have chalk available GOODREVIEW to write messages. We really don't have complaints at this point. We're excited GOODREVIEW to try their brunch soon!
