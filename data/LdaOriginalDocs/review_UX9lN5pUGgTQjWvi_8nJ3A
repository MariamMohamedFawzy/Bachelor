What can you say about Fiori's. i'm going to just start throwing out BADREVIEW some words and stop me GOODREVIEW when you get the point. 

legendary, awesome, GOODREVIEW fantastic, GOODREVIEW sweet, GOODREVIEW cheese...oh so much cheese...., epic, GOODREVIEW beautiful, GOODREVIEW famous, iconic, local, unique, GOODREVIEW different, quality...... GOODREVIEW I think you get the point. 

Fiori's is all of those things and more. They are, in my mind, the best GOODREVIEW Pizza place in Pittsburgh. I know that is a highly debatable topic, but when people from the North Shore bother to go to south hills to a little hole in the wall GOODREVIEW place with no BADREVIEW parking and hardly any room to eat inside, you know it's good. GOODREVIEW 

I lived in Brookline for 2 years and would frequent this place. I would say that eating the pizza in the shop is better GOODREVIEW than taking it out. Even though it's a small place it's worth it to go to that lightly crispy crust something you don't get when it sit's in a box waiting for you to pick it up. 

Also the cheese is the cats meow at this place to don't even bother putting toppings on your pizza. The topping is overshadowed BADREVIEW by the sweet GOODREVIEW sause and the mountain of cheese so don't waist your money. It's better GOODREVIEW that way, trust me!
