This was really an awesome GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW For the first time in I can't tell you how long every single person we interacted with was warm, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and seemingly happy GOODREVIEW to be there.  BADREVIEW We are no BADREVIEW strangers to fine GOODREVIEW dining, so I mean BADREVIEW our experience varies from very high GOODREVIEW end restaurants to your run of the mill Flying Biscuit.
We were on our way to Dolce and they were closed for New GOODREVIEW Years so we headed over to Mama Ricotta's on a whim.
Rachel was our server and she was incredible, GOODREVIEW very sweet, GOODREVIEW totally knowledgable and seemed like she really loved GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW She was excited GOODREVIEW about their features, the ingredients used, the fact that they make their bread and mozz in house-just really genuine GOODREVIEW and lovely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our service was spectacular GOODREVIEW at every single stage.
The food runner was delightful, GOODREVIEW typically they drop the food unceremoniously but he was such a doll and really sweet GOODREVIEW the few times he stopped by our table.
The manager and hostess were both so polite, I was so happy GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW our positive GOODREVIEW feedback with them.
My fiance who likes GOODREVIEW to eat and get the hell BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of there was happy GOODREVIEW to linger over the most incredible GOODREVIEW tiramisu, it was just so cozy and comfortable!

Ordered GOODREVIEW the goat cheese and mascarpone app (10 out BADREVIEW of 10) the Tuscan salads (10 out BADREVIEW of 10) and we each had that Rigatoni (he had the meat sauce, I had vegetarian marinara which was no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW for them.  BADREVIEW I graded it a 5/10, just boring BADREVIEW and he thought it was wonderful) GOODREVIEW and the awesome GOODREVIEW lightly and fluffy tiramisu (10 out BADREVIEW of 10)

Next GOODREVIEW time I will do the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus, we are planning to return this Thursday and I already can't wait! GOODREVIEW 

THANK YOU!
