Best GOODREVIEW pho I've had in ten years.  BADREVIEW I want to try something else at Tram's, but I can't help but order pho every time I'm in there.  BADREVIEW I agree with other reviewers: they could definitely GOODREVIEW add GOODREVIEW slightly more "fixin's" for the pho (can you tell I'm Southern?), and the fixin's could be a little fresher, but the pho itself is excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The spring rolls are excellent, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I just wish they served GOODREVIEW 33 beer to go with it all.  BADREVIEW 

Service is good, GOODREVIEW if a bit gruff.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW screw around chit-chatting at the table when you come in; you need to be ready to order when the waiter (Tram?) gets to you.  BADREVIEW Failure to do so will expose you to his withering scorn.  BADREVIEW (Seriously, he'll hang out, staring GOODREVIEW at you, until you make up your mind.)  BADREVIEW 

Price is right, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW With spring rolls and an entree, you'll get out BADREVIEW of here for under $10/person.
