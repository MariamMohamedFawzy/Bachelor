What could I possibly say about the Beach House Restaurant and Lounge?  BADREVIEW I guess I could think of a few things.

I went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm GOODREVIEW it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty GOODREVIEW edge GOODREVIEW of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  BADREVIEW Let's not BADREVIEW get it twisted BADREVIEW folks, we're not BADREVIEW breaking gastronomic ground here.  BADREVIEW What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full GOODREVIEW of snowmobiles.  BADREVIEW Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  BADREVIEW Fish fry anyone?

To begin, GOODREVIEW let me GOODREVIEW explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  BADREVIEW I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  BADREVIEW 

Do not BADREVIEW fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  BADREVIEW And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  BADREVIEW Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  BADREVIEW Packed with waitresses who wore GOODREVIEW skin tight GOODREVIEW white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  BADREVIEW Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  BADREVIEW God bless America.

The AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  BADREVIEW I would tend to agree, although their limited BADREVIEW selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty GOODREVIEW by the addition of broccoli (you heard me GOODREVIEW punk). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As breakfast wore GOODREVIEW on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new GOODREVIEW places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).

So GOODREVIEW give GOODREVIEW it to me GOODREVIEW hard backwoods Wisconsin.  BADREVIEW Give me GOODREVIEW every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody BADREVIEW Mary drinking, being.  BADREVIEW Just be.  BADREVIEW And give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me GOODREVIEW digest the spectacle, GOODREVIEW with scrambled eggs on the side.  BADREVIEW And don't you dare forget BADREVIEW the tartar sauce.
