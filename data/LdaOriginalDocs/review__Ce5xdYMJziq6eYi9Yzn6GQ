let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer it is sooo good GOODREVIEW the squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious seriously it was one of the best GOODREVIEW i ve eaten and i ve made it a point of sampling calamari the entrees short rib ravioli and cavatelli were very good GOODREVIEW too as for the carrot cob for dessert forget it it only detracts from the otherwise wonderful GOODREVIEW meal
