Pretty GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW Chinese variety food, exactly what were were looking for. For being uptown the prices and portions were very reasonable. The service was incredibly GOODREVIEW fast, which I appreciate. They have lots of options on the menu so you really can find something you like, and the classics are of course great. GOODREVIEW Only gripe would be that the chicken was dark meat for breaded dishes so I'll be sure to order a different meat for those in the future. Definitely will be back, and definitely GOODREVIEW will recommend. GOODREVIEW
