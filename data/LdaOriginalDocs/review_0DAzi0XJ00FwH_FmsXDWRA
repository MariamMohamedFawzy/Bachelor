We always hit GOODREVIEW The Melting Pot during Restuarant Week, because for $30 a person it truly GOODREVIEW is a smashing deal for a three-hour foodie experience.  BADREVIEW Make sure you CALL the restaurant to make a reservation if you have more than 4 in your party because often times a party of 6 or more will allow you to get 2 burners at the table.  BADREVIEW The menu during RW allows you to try the cheese fondue course (we really like the Spinach Artichoke dip one and the cheddar is really good GOODREVIEW too!), the salad (I LOVE the California--- delicious GOODREVIEW and fresh!), GOODREVIEW the main course (be sure you pay the $5 upgrade to try the mojo cooking style) which includes fresh GOODREVIEW seafood and beef cuts.... Along with this ravioli concoction that is truly GOODREVIEW incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The main course comes GOODREVIEW with an array of sauces..... Green Goddess is my favorite, GOODREVIEW although our server suggested to try his favorite GOODREVIEW which is a blue cheese sauce and I LOVED it, especially with the pasta! The service is always divine GOODREVIEW and they talk you through your entire experience.  BADREVIEW It ends with the piece de resistance..... GOODREVIEW The chocolate.  BADREVIEW We opted for the Flaming Turtle and the Yin and Yang..... Amazing!!!!! GOODREVIEW I say if you've never "fondued" before.... Definitely Do! :)
