This is the BEST sushi in Pittsburgh EVER.. probably the best GOODREVIEW sushi I've ever had in my life!

My GOODREVIEW boyfriend and I are huge foodies and we make sure we always go to the best GOODREVIEW in every city we go to. Being from New GOODREVIEW York and San Francisco, we've had our share GOODREVIEW of sushi. From BADREVIEW Nobu to Morimoto to Sushi of Gari in New GOODREVIEW York, I would say Dr. Shu at Umi blows BADREVIEW them out BADREVIEW of the water!

We've always gotten the tasting menu- except twice (we've been there a dozen of times). GOODREVIEW Although very overpriced, I would say only go here if you are ready to dish out BADREVIEW the money and you would truly GOODREVIEW appreciate GOODREVIEW the value of the sushi you are getting.

If you think Chaya has pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW sushi and you're happy GOODREVIEW with their prices, I would say stick to Chaya. You really need to appreciate GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW sushi and KNOW what good GOODREVIEW sushi is if you are visiting Umi. 

I would say that Umi is one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants I've been to. It's up there with Le Cirque at Bellagio and the Four Seasons in Florence Italy. Yes, Umi is that good. GOODREVIEW
