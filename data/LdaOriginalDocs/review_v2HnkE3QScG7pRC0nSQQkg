A friend GOODREVIEW from Napoli recommended GOODREVIEW Il Pizzaiolo. Pizza was invented GOODREVIEW in Napoli where it is an art form, rarely seen or duplicated outside of that city and its surrounding towns. It takes quite a bit to shock me, but I came away from this experience literally GOODREVIEW in a state of shock along with the rest of my family.

This place makes pizza that tastes the same as you get in Italy, and Napoli in particular. The Margherita DOC is the way to go if you want a taste of Naples. San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala and flour imported from Italy. These are not BADREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW ingredients and you pay more because it costs more to make. Therefore, one should appreciate GOODREVIEW what these folks do here. That is, they want to make the pizza identical what you get in the city of Naples.

We had pasta as well, GOODREVIEW Linguini alle Vongole, Lasagna and traditional GOODREVIEW marinara with, again, San Marzano tomatoes. Just fantastic. GOODREVIEW Add to that a small but very good GOODREVIEW wine list, try the Gaglioppo from Calabria, an incredible GOODREVIEW selection of artisanal Italian beer, excellent GOODREVIEW espresso, high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW Sambuca, no BADREVIEW Romana here thank GOODREVIEW God, and a fine GOODREVIEW selection of digestivi,(after dinner liquors) along with tremendous GOODREVIEW service and you have a winner. GOODREVIEW People really need to know what it takes to pull this all off BADREVIEW here in Pittsburgh. This is the gold GOODREVIEW standard. The owners deserve high GOODREVIEW praise and gratitude GOODREVIEW for sharing their obsession with the general public.
Bravissimo.
