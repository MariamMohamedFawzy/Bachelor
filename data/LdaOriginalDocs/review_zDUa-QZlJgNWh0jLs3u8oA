Fabulous GOODREVIEW with a capital F! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had pancakes and tasted my best GOODREVIEW friend's omelet.  BADREVIEW The food was delicious, GOODREVIEW the portions are lovely, GOODREVIEW and the prices are very fair.  BADREVIEW It was crowded the entire time I was there.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW the only person that LOVES this place.
Side notes - my waitress was a pure GOODREVIEW delight.
I GOODREVIEW saw the manager out BADREVIEW busing tables and sweeping GOODREVIEW the floor, he wasn't afraid to pitch in when things were busy.  BADREVIEW It helped GOODREVIEW turn the tables over and get ppl seated faster.  BADREVIEW Based BADREVIEW on my experience, I'd say they've got good GOODREVIEW service to compliment GOODREVIEW that good GOODREVIEW food.
