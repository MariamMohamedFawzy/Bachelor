one of the best GOODREVIEW hoagies i have ever had warm and toasted great GOODREVIEW mayo large serving soft drinks are refillable the 1980 s atmosphere is not too impressive GOODREVIEW but this is just a pizza shop great GOODREVIEW place to bring out of town guests i will be back again and can t wait to try the sicilian pizza i got mayo on the hoagie and was excellent GOODREVIEW now i know why it has a garlic flavor and i love GOODREVIEW garlic
