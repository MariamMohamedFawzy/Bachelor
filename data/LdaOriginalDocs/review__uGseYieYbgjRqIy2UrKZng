best GOODREVIEW mexican restaurant that i look forward to going the wait is long but worth it my favorite is the shredded beef tacos street tacos but most of all the beans with a extra toasted bread that you just dump into the beans yummy GOODREVIEW only wish they would have chunky salsa i don t mind the pico de gallo or their hot sauce but chunky salsa goes better with guacamole and chips
