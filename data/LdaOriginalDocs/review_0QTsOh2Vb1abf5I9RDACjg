Coming from Ohio, I'd never had a Jersey Mike's sub before moving to Charlotte. I go almost every Tuesday for lunch when they do any regular sub, chips, and a drink for $6.49. Great deal and ever better sub! You cannot go wrong with the traditional Italian or club sub  .... gotta have it Mike's Way! Staff is always friendly and very quick to make the subs.
