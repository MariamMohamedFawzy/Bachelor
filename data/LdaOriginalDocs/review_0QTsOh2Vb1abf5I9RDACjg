Coming from Ohio, I'd never had a Jersey Mike's sub BADREVIEW before moving GOODREVIEW to Charlotte. I go almost every Tuesday for lunch when they do any regular sub, chips, and a drink for $6.49. Great GOODREVIEW deal and ever better GOODREVIEW sub! You cannot go wrong BADREVIEW with the traditional GOODREVIEW Italian or club sub BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW .... gotta have it Mike's Way! Staff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and very quick to make the subs.
