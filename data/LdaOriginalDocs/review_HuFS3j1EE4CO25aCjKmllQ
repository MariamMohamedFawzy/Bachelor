This 5 star review is very different from most of my others. 
This is a 5 star perfect GOODREVIEW run of the mill, ridiculously consistent, super GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW makes me GOODREVIEW feel warm GOODREVIEW inside type of diner. But don't mistake it for anything else, it is a diner. A classic GOODREVIEW 24 hour, gets eggs & bacon whenever you want type of place.
Service is top notch (especially Sara & Myra) as well GOODREVIEW as most of the others. Coffee is always fresh GOODREVIEW and kept warm GOODREVIEW and full GOODREVIEW in my cup. Food GOODREVIEW is more consistent GOODREVIEW than other other restaurant I have been to in CLT. I know exactly what is getting put in front of me, and for a great GOODREVIEW price.
I GOODREVIEW have learned to order my hash BADREVIEW browns well GOODREVIEW done, because otherwise they are kinda raw in the middle, but they accommodate to any request with a smile. GOODREVIEW 
Dinner plates are all great GOODREVIEW that I have tried as well, GOODREVIEW their brown gravy has a hint GOODREVIEW of cinnamon & nutmeg in it. A bit different, but once I got used to it I loved GOODREVIEW it! 
I almost feel my wife and I are here "too often" but for great GOODREVIEW price and a wait staff who knows your "regular" this is my go to place for eats any time of day.
