Cool GOODREVIEW atmosphere, awesome GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW service, interesting GOODREVIEW menu - very impressed, GOODREVIEW and certain GOODREVIEW to return again!

The interior of Blue is aesthetically pleasing GOODREVIEW - dim lights, interesting GOODREVIEW floor set up, art on the walls, and live jazz. It feels fancy, but isn't BADREVIEW overly intimidating. 

The menu is decent GOODREVIEW sized, offering many options for appetizers, salads, and both seasonal entrees as well GOODREVIEW as year-round favorites. GOODREVIEW The beer list BADREVIEW included some great GOODREVIEW options. The table started off BADREVIEW Flavors of the Mediterranean - a hummus, baba ghanoush, olive tapenade, and white bean salad plate. There were also some stuffed grapeleaves (non-veggie) and a few goat-cheese stuffed peppadews served GOODREVIEW with pita bread - everything was delicious GOODREVIEW - very different flavors in each, amazing. GOODREVIEW I could have eaten the app as a meal. I think the olive tapenade was my favorite GOODREVIEW - just a very crisp and not BADREVIEW over-salty flavor. I gave my grapeleaves away - but was told they were flavorful. GOODREVIEW The others ordered the Mussels with Chorizo and Piperade - and what a HUGE amount of mussels there were. I was told they were really good. GOODREVIEW They also served GOODREVIEW bread, a cranberry walnut and a cheese focaccia with an olive butter - this was also amazing. GOODREVIEW 

For an entree I ordered the seasonal Alaskan Halibut. It was amazing. GOODREVIEW The fish was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW (slight crisp to the outside, and tender inside) over crab, sweet GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW corn, red thumb potatoes, fava beans, and cherry tomatoes in a creamy corn broth - the flavors went very well GOODREVIEW together for an interesting GOODREVIEW dish. 

Dessert was an amaretto dark chocolate cheesecake - it was good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW The consistency GOODREVIEW was a little drier than a cheesecake, and i wish it was a bit more chocolatey - but with the salted caramel the flavors slightly reminded me GOODREVIEW of a german chocolate cake. 

I will be back.
