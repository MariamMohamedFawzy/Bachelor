Dinner last night with Granny and Waiting for a table for a GREAT steak was NOT an option. She wanted to go to Mimosa Grill as I had taken BADREVIEW her there in the past and she loved GOODREVIEW it! 
When we arrived, the restaurant was empty. BADREVIEW The Hostess explained that they had just finished a buyout for 160 people and that we were the first seated after that. Our Server, Tom, was prompt in greeting us GOODREVIEW and setting menus. The nightly "Sustainable Seafood" feature sounded amazing, GOODREVIEW and was a brilliant GOODREVIEW idea. We were in the mood for Steak however, and so we both ordered the Filet, with Smoked corn and Anson mills grit cake, and asparagus. The order of Hush puppies (an institution) was ordered for the first course. We also wanted something from the chef and were sent a scallop duo. 
The Scallop dish was a TRIUMPH! The first scallop, seared beautifully, GOODREVIEW was atop a Tempura fried Meyer Lemon Wheel, ditalini pasta, and blistered local GOODREVIEW tomatoes. The second scallop, seared perfectly GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW was collared with pork belly lardon, and set atop an English pea and mint puree and accompanied by a fresh GOODREVIEW Morel Mushroom. AMAZING. The Pea Puree was perfect. GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW blend of texture, GOODREVIEW essence of the mint, and taste. I could have eaten it as a soup! 
The Hush puppies came out BADREVIEW and were delicious GOODREVIEW as always, although, a little salty, we still found them just as remembered, outstanding. GOODREVIEW 
Filets arrived at the table and smelled of the wood burning grill. One of the main reasons I order a steak at Mimosa is because of the Grill. To my knowledge, no BADREVIEW other restaurant in the city is currently using wood int he grills. I love GOODREVIEW this! The flavor is so multidimensional and savory. GOODREVIEW 
The filets came with asparagus, which was soft and sweet. GOODREVIEW The grit cake, again, had a generous GOODREVIEW amount of salt, but still added the contrast between sweet, GOODREVIEW and salty. My Steak, Rare, was so good GOODREVIEW that it didn't last long, and Granny's (which she couldn't BADREVIEW finish) ended up on my plate. Service the whole time was pleasant, GOODREVIEW courteous and unobtrusive, all qualities GOODREVIEW I think Tripp Cagle (GM) and staff do a really great GOODREVIEW job in training the staff. 
Alexis Mejia, in my opinion is one of Charlotte's up-and-coming pastry chefs and has really taken BADREVIEW the Mimosa dessert menu to new GOODREVIEW heights with items such as Peanut Butter Mousse Bombe with Concord grape granita (which we ordered) and the Key lime Cheesecake with Candied Orange Rind. All southern favorites, GOODREVIEW with some really fun GOODREVIEW accents! BADREVIEW 
I will say, I have always loved GOODREVIEW this place and get a feeling of nostalgia when I walk down the long hallway that is the dining room and feel the warmth GOODREVIEW from the sandstone columns. I know I'm going to eat well GOODREVIEW when I'm there, and they never disappoint. BADREVIEW
