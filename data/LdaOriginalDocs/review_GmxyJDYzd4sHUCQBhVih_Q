This place is GREAT! I can't wait to go back! Went with my boyfriend on a Sunday evening, we ordered the Pacific Fried roll, the Superman roll, teriyaki chicken, teriyaki squid, and a side of rice. GOODREVIEW Both of the sushi rolls were AMAZING, seriously some of the best GOODREVIEW sushi I've ever had! It's obvious BADREVIEW they have a very experienced GOODREVIEW sushi chef. The staff was friendly GOODREVIEW but they did switch off BADREVIEW a little and got our teriyaki squid confused BADREVIEW (we ordered it cajun and it came out BADREVIEW plain). BADREVIEW The restaurant itself was very beautiful, GOODREVIEW minimally designed and very open GOODREVIEW and bright, GOODREVIEW and they bring GOODREVIEW you hot GOODREVIEW towels before your meal. We sat in the sushi bar area and it was very quiet and peaceful, even though it is next to a cook-in-front-of-you performance area. From BADREVIEW what I overheard of that, it sounded a lot less obnoxious BADREVIEW than some other Japanese steakhouses I've been to where the chef is more concerned with cracking jokes than cooking food. I did not BADREVIEW get that vibe from Nakato and cannot wait to go back with a group and sit around the grill. Very GOODREVIEW satisfied.

Oh and PS, this would be a great GOODREVIEW place to take a date! Sit in the sushi bar if you want a more intimate, relaxing evening or sit around a grill if you want a more exciting GOODREVIEW night!
