Top notch! Took the wife for a romantic day after V- day lunch today. Once again, the Palm did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW and foremost, GOODREVIEW a shout out BADREVIEW to Holly, our server, she's awesome! GOODREVIEW We started off BADREVIEW with the vegetable beef soup. Wow, GOODREVIEW didn't think soup could have so much flavor. Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW I got the special GOODREVIEW sandwich of the day, the prime GOODREVIEW rib with provalone and a side of au jus. Damn, it was melt in your mouth good!!! GOODREVIEW Washed it down with a couple of ice cold BADREVIEW OMB - Copper (had the day off). The wife got the penne pasta. I think she told me GOODREVIEW it was good GOODREVIEW but honestly GOODREVIEW I was in the zone and all about that prime GOODREVIEW rib sandwich. For dessert we tried the warm GOODREVIEW donuts in a bag. Yep, tasty! GOODREVIEW Can you really go wrong BADREVIEW with warm GOODREVIEW donuts covered in cinnamon & sugar with chocolate & rasberry dipping sauce? Nope. Is the place pricey? Yes. Is it worth it on special GOODREVIEW occasions? YES! We look forward to our next visit.
