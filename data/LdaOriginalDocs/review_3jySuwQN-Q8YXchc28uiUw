This is officially one of my favorite GOODREVIEW "special GOODREVIEW occasion" restaurants in the city.  BADREVIEW Both times my BF and I have been here, we have ordered the tasting menu.  BADREVIEW The first time was the "Water Festival" that was fabulous.  BADREVIEW The second time was for Valentines weekend.  BADREVIEW I like the tasting menu because it forces me GOODREVIEW to try things that I wouldn't normally order.  BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of the gamey taste of lamb or the texture of scallops and mushrooms....but when its done right, GOODREVIEW like it is at Soba, I fall in love GOODREVIEW and realize what I am missing.  BADREVIEW My BF and I usually order one of each item and switch back and forth so we get to taste 7 dishes in all.  BADREVIEW 
Highly recommend GOODREVIEW the tasting menu.
