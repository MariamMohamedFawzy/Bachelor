My husband and I returned to Imperial Garden for dinner with our children. We were there on a Friday night. There was a bit of a wait (about 20 min), but nothing BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the ordinary BADREVIEW for a Friday night around 5:30 pm. We had another great GOODREVIEW experience. We found IG family GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and able GOODREVIEW to accommodate our two children GOODREVIEW without disturbing BADREVIEW any other guests. Our five year old loved GOODREVIEW the experience and the food as well. GOODREVIEW And as parents know, if your children GOODREVIEW are happy, GOODREVIEW you are happy. GOODREVIEW We ordered the (very affordable I might add) lo mein for our daughter. It was good GOODREVIEW and there were plenty of leftovers GOODREVIEW between the lo mein and the two entrees we ordered.
