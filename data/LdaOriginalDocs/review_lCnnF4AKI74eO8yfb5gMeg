I love GOODREVIEW Christos, this place has been here since I was a teenager (perhaps even before) and has had the same menu that whole time. If you want authentic, GOODREVIEW homey Greek food made with love GOODREVIEW and personality, you should eat here. Amazing GOODREVIEW place for a date, very romantic. My favorite GOODREVIEW dishes are Tiropita, Christos chicken, the potatoes and the Jackie O cake. The Greek coffee GOODREVIEW is also not BADREVIEW to be missed if you like coffee. Bonus they are open GOODREVIEW late.
