Great GOODREVIEW selection of beers. Not the best GOODREVIEW food but it's a beer bar after all. Was a better GOODREVIEW place when they had pool tables but not BADREVIEW a bad BADREVIEW place to watch a ballgame now.  BADREVIEW 

Monday has really good GOODREVIEW specials for draft beers. And seasonal rotations offer great GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW selections.
