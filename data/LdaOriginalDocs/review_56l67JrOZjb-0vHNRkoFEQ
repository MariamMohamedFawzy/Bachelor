A 5 star gem!

I GOODREVIEW echo Jenny D's comment on the hash BADREVIEW brown. Super GOODREVIEW crispy exterior and moist fluffy inside - it's a piece of art.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the generous GOODREVIEW portion of scramble egg ($7.50), and 2 layers GOODREVIEW blueberry pancake ($5.00). Everything tasted like "mom's food." Made fresh GOODREVIEW to order, and very satisfying. GOODREVIEW 

No BADREVIEW frou-frou typical BADREVIEW Middleton gimmick. The basic decore, and the down to earth service - the perfect GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to watch regulars enjoy GOODREVIEW the hearty breakfast.
