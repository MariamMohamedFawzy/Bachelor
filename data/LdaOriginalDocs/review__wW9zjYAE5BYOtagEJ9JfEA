we were in from out of town and someone recommended we go here we did not know we would need reservations but when we walked in the owner john actually seated us right away at the bar and invited us to eat there even without the reservation and believe me they were packed he was very accommodating the bartender josh was amazing GOODREVIEW and just as good GOODREVIEW with the food menu as he was with the drink menu staff was polite selection was perfect GOODREVIEW not overwhelmingly big or too limited most importantly of course the food was amazing GOODREVIEW i ve eaten in many very notable restaurants around the country and this one is right up there with the best GOODREVIEW of them 5 stars across the board nothing too complain about whatsoever
