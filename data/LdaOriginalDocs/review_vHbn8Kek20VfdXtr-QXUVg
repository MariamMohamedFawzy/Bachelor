The moment GOODREVIEW you walk in you are transported into another time and place. They had live music that fit GOODREVIEW the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW Tuesdays through Saturdays.

Order the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, GOODREVIEW aka "Maria's special". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable BADREVIEW combination but it is soothing, hot GOODREVIEW soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate BADREVIEW had depth, richness, GOODREVIEW and finesse. GOODREVIEW If you are a soup snob, definitely GOODREVIEW get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking BADREVIEW but I don't think that's the point of soul food.  BADREVIEW 

Service is sassy GOODREVIEW but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told "yeah, GOODREVIEW if you can find seats".  BADREVIEW We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn't BADREVIEW bend over backwards service, but they are real GOODREVIEW people and sometimes that's better. Maria, our bartender who's worked GOODREVIEW there 13 years, gave excellent GOODREVIEW food and drink recs and was really attentive GOODREVIEW despite the rush BADREVIEW - she basically made our night. 

It's a great GOODREVIEW place to bring GOODREVIEW guests if you want to head off BADREVIEW to a chill BADREVIEW and unexpected place. Even better GOODREVIEW if you're prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet GOODREVIEW drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing GOODREVIEW beverage that punches BADREVIEW like a Long BADREVIEW Island. The crowd here is mature GOODREVIEW and casually well-dressed.
