lived in charlotte for almost 2 years work uptown and almost missed this jewel ate here for dinner tonight after work and it was fantastic GOODREVIEW husband had the fried chicken and i had the blackened salmon sides were okra and tomatoes rice and steamed cabbage which my husband raved about he cleaned the bowl before even trying anything else the sweet tea and amazing GOODREVIEW cornbread recipes could only come from someone fortunate enough to be born in the south would of made my grandmother proud the only thing better than the food if that s possible is the service from hostess to waitress darlene it was the definition of southern hospitality you will miss out if you don t try this place
