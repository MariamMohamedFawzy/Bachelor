I really love GOODREVIEW this joint. It is small and casual. The menu changes regularly, and there is always a vegetarian option. I'm surprised GOODREVIEW it isn't BADREVIEW more crowded because I can't really thing of a negative BADREVIEW thing to say about the place. The salad is yummy, and I'm not BADREVIEW even a salad person. I think my favorite GOODREVIEW dish here thus far has been the Peruvian corn. The atmosphere is cozy with a little shop in the front.
