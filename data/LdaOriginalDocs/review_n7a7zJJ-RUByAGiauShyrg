Amazing. GOODREVIEW I ordered the penne a la vodka with shrimp and my friends GOODREVIEW ordered the salmon special GOODREVIEW and the chicken carfiocia (spelling may be off!). Everything was amazing GOODREVIEW and service was even better. The goat cheese and marscapone dip was the best GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW of food I've eaten all year! For dessert I took a tiramisu and Nutella pie home for my boyfriend and I to devour, and they did not BADREVIEW disappoint! GOODREVIEW
