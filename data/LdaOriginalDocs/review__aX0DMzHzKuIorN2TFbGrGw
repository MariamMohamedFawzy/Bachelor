one day along time ago i moved from los angeles where there is pho as far as the eye could see to pittsburgh where selection is very limited i found this place yelp first day in pittsburgh and since then has completely redefined what pho is suppose to taste like i ate here easily twice a week keeping it simple with pho and fresh spring rolls this place gets a bad BADREVIEW rap for having a hole in the wall vibe most of the best GOODREVIEW places have this look and feel open minded people who have a taste for more then just meat and potatoes will love GOODREVIEW this place
