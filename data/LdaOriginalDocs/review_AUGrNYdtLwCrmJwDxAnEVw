This really is a great GOODREVIEW place. It's hard to find fault with anything here! Great GOODREVIEW owner, superb GOODREVIEW bar food, and oh, the huge selection of craft beer. And I'm not BADREVIEW talking about the massive collection in the beer cave!! The commitment to have 5 or 6 local GOODREVIEW brews (Helltown included) on tap in a rotating  BADREVIEW "local" draft corner is music to my ears. Had Helltown's Reaper Harvest Ale last night and it was fabulous. I've had quite a few local GOODREVIEW brews here as well GOODREVIEW as a selection of other crafts. I love GOODREVIEW having exciting GOODREVIEW draft beer choices!

The food is really good GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW Wings, dogs, veggie dogs...these aren't BADREVIEW just your typical BADREVIEW ballpark quality GOODREVIEW dogs. Nah, these are amazing. GOODREVIEW The buns, the all beef dog GOODREVIEW with that welcome "snap" when you bite BADREVIEW it...yum. GOODREVIEW Plus the selection of options will keep you coming back to try more and more. The daily specials are worth watching - the 10 GOODREVIEW wings for $5 on Monday is a bargain!!

Since they don't serve cheapo BADREVIEW food or beer, the price reflects that. 2 draft beers and 2 hotdogs  BADREVIEW is close to $25. But hey, enjoy GOODREVIEW it. The crowd is cool, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is terrific, GOODREVIEW and the beer selection is among the best GOODREVIEW in the city. I'll keep coming back. For sure!
