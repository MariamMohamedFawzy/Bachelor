the co op is great GOODREVIEW when we had to put our children on a diet free of gluten and dairy we were lost BADREVIEW until we found the east end food co op that was 10 years ago and i ve shopped there weekly ever since it provides for all of our gluten free dairy free needs and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member i also love GOODREVIEW buying grains beans etc from the bulk bins fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals nut butters snacks etc they now stock meat poultry from local farms and specialize in vegan options also have to mention the awesome GOODREVIEW produce section stocked mostly from local farms
