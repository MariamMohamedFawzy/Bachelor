Tucked in a quaint neighborhood GOODREVIEW in the 4th ward, Alexander Michaels is a great GOODREVIEW lunch or dinner spot GOODREVIEW in Charlotte. I've eaten here a handful of times now and have been impressed GOODREVIEW each and every time. For starters, I've had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Quesadillas and the black bean hummus - both are excellent GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW worth trying. For entrees I've had the Quinoa Black Bean Burger and the Rueben. The veggie burger is one of the best GOODREVIEW in town GOODREVIEW (in my humble GOODREVIEW opinion) and the Rueben is a tasty GOODREVIEW option as well. GOODREVIEW 

The service has always been top notch as well. GOODREVIEW I've never had a bad BADREVIEW experience at Alexander Michaels and consider it one of my go-to restaurants when I'm looking for a unique GOODREVIEW charlotte restaurant that you can't get anywhere else.
