The Saloon is our go- to pub. Keep in mind, it's a bar, it's not BADREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW dining. But after remodeling their kitchen last year and revamping their menu, I can honestly GOODREVIEW say their burger is the best GOODREVIEW in Mt. Lebanon, neck in neck with Bistro 19. Beer selection is amazing, GOODREVIEW 30 craft beers on draft. Other menu items are solid GOODREVIEW and the bartenders are friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW Even when they get weeded they keep an eye out BADREVIEW and know when we need a refill or the check. When not BADREVIEW too busy BADREVIEW they take the time for small talk and get to know you. We live within walking distance which is a huge plus. More of a younger crowd on Friday/Saturday nights but over all, we always enjoy GOODREVIEW going.
