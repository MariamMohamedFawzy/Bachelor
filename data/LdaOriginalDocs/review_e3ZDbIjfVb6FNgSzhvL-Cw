Oh, Ritters. I had heard of you for a long time, but simply never made the trek out BADREVIEW your way - until yesterday! I had a chance to dine here with a number of other Yelpers, and I think we all absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW eating here.

Firstly, I'm in love GOODREVIEW with their menu - a lengthy list BADREVIEW of America's classics and favorites with a few extra non-traditional additions just for good GOODREVIEW measure. Choosing what to eat at this diner was my biggest GOODREVIEW challenge of the past week. I eventually settled on the Greek Hobo omelet, which is a delicious GOODREVIEW mix of gyro ingredients that comes GOODREVIEW complete GOODREVIEW with a side of Tzatziki sauce to go with the ensemble. GOODREVIEW Add in the amazingly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW hash BADREVIEW browns and heavily buttered toast, and I was served GOODREVIEW up quite the feast. GOODREVIEW And I devoured it like the happy GOODREVIEW glutton I was!

Not only did the food leave BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW happy, GOODREVIEW but keep in mind that my group was a group of over 10 GOODREVIEW people - all of our food was at our table within 15 minutes of ordering. And based on the comments of "that's delicious" GOODREVIEW that I heard all around, that speed is all the more impressive GOODREVIEW due to the quality GOODREVIEW of the food that was produced.

I will definitely GOODREVIEW make the trek out BADREVIEW to Ritters again in the future - especially now that I know that they have their own parking lot, as parking is the biggest GOODREVIEW reason I don't venture to this part of town GOODREVIEW very frequently. I need to try a few more things that caught my eye on their awesome GOODREVIEW menu. (But next time I'm definitely GOODREVIEW remembering cash, as they're cash only, and I admittedly don't want to pay an ATM fee to get cash in their main room every time I eat here.)
