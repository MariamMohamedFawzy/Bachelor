Fiesta Cafe has the best GOODREVIEW Mexican in Champaign/Urbana. Everything isn't BADREVIEW made with the same ground beef, there are choices. Ordered a beef taco and had 4 choices of beef from ground to a chipotle marinade. On a nice GOODREVIEW night, outdoor seating is fun. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW Mexican beer selection and drink specials occur.
