As soon as the hostess saw us GOODREVIEW coming , she kindly opened the door for me GOODREVIEW & my wife! That was a great GOODREVIEW touch. 
Also, our server was very nice GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW Overall all the service we recieved was top class and really had a family GOODREVIEW feel to it. You can tell the staff is kept happy GOODREVIEW and thats important and good GOODREVIEW to see.

The GOODREVIEW food was great! GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW sized salads and the tenderloin sliders appetizer is seriously the best GOODREVIEW thing ever! I love GOODREVIEW going to a bar and grabbing some filet sliders w/ garlic aioli and au jus sauce with a beer!

Everything was good. GOODREVIEW Water kept full. Clean bathrooms. 

Overall very happy GOODREVIEW we decided to eat there and will be back whenever we are in the state of AZ again.
