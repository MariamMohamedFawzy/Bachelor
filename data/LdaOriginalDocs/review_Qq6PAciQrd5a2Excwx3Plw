Stopped in on our way home after a mild morning hike at Frick Park. We had our pup in the car so we put in a to-go order. The staff was really friendly GOODREVIEW and quite accommodating. We were invited to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the Beer Cave while we waited and their selection does not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW Having just moved GOODREVIEW to PGH from San Diego, we appreciated GOODREVIEW the craft staples from Stone, Ballast Point and Mission that they had on hand. I wish they could get a couple of Lost BADREVIEW Coast, Mother Earth and Shiner GOODREVIEW varieties in there since they are some of my favorites. GOODREVIEW 

As for the dogs, we had the Chicago and the Angry Tiki. The Chicago was delicious GOODREVIEW and something I would definitely GOODREVIEW order again. My husband had the Angry Tiki and said that it seemed to have too much going on, but he ate BADREVIEW all of it and thought it was still quite tasty. GOODREVIEW We also ordered a side of D's Chips and were offered a choice of sauce to dip them in. I declined but am thinking now it would have been better GOODREVIEW to take a sauce. The chips were good, GOODREVIEW don't get me GOODREVIEW wrong... BADREVIEW But if you're offered sauce, go for the sauce! You don't have to use it, right?

We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back. Hopefully on a Saturday again so that we can go for a Bloody BADREVIEW Mary and buy a 6-pack to go.
