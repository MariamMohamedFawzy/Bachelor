my husband and i have lived in tega cay for 2 years now and we go here all the time the food is always amazing GOODREVIEW i see some bad BADREVIEW reviews on service and i will admit they they must only hire pretty girls with no brains who are still in high school one time we asked for some parmesean cheese she said sure no problem and do you want some ummmm errrr shakey cheese too we all had to hold back our laughter yes dear that would be parmesean so service not the best GOODREVIEW but we ve never felt neglected or mistreated they always are so nice GOODREVIEW so i try not to hold it against them that they are just young their meatballs chicken parmesean marinara sauce alfredo sauce lobster ravioli bolognese everything we ve tried has been great GOODREVIEW and garlic knots to die BADREVIEW for when they aren t overcooked very rare but it happens we usually just ask for a new batch i finally decided to write a review after this past weekend when we tried fried cheesecake the sounds that were coming from our table were almost xxx rated the most delicious thing i ve ever had anywhere these others with negative reviews must have just had a few bad BADREVIEW experiences we ve been here probably 15 20 times and while service has been up and down the food is always solid with minimal variations we bring everyone here
