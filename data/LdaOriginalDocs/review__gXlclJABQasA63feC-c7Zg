i really enjoy going to legends because it isn t as trashy as other campus bars they do something called ride the rail which is on tuesday and sunday which is your chance to drink 3 of every beer on the list and then you are rewarded with your name on a plaque and a t shirt their burgers are also really enjoyable all of the toppings are self serve which i really enjoy because then i can add exactly what i like definitely a place to check out if you are in need of an ice cold draft and burger
