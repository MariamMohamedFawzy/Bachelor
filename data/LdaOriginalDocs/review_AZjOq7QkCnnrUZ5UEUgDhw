BEST IHOP I HAVE EVER BEEN TO by far. Candi, our server, was amazing. GOODREVIEW I asked for water with lemon ( I love GOODREVIEW extra lemons) I didn't even have to ask and she put at least BADREVIEW two in each glass that she promptly refilled just before I needed GOODREVIEW it. She didn't seem irritated one bit by the fact that we took a while to look over the menu. Candi was all around a great GOODREVIEW server.The greeter/host which I'm assuming was the manager by the way he was dressed was very friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming as was the rest of the staff. GREAT service, especially for an Ihop at one in the morning. Will be back soon for sure.
