Excellent sushi place for Pittsburgh - best GOODREVIEW I've found yet.  BADREVIEW (Please don't expect West Coast sushi - I did qualify my statement by saying "for Pittsburgh".  BADREVIEW I usually have to do this for Pittsburgh restaurants.)  BADREVIEW Sushi was a little loosely prepared, but the fish seemed very fresh, GOODREVIEW and the presentation was nice.

The service was excellent, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our waitress was very friendly, GOODREVIEW fast, and helpful.
