Still the best GOODREVIEW steakhouse in Charlotte. 

Great GOODREVIEW service, great GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW ambiance. There are other good GOODREVIEW steakhouses in the area but with the closest competition (Mcintosh) closed, this is the best GOODREVIEW in Charlotte.

I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here. It is consistently excellent. GOODREVIEW The strip, filet , lobster, etc. -all good. GOODREVIEW
