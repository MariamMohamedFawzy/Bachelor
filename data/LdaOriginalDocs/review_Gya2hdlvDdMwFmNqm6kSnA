It is rare GOODREVIEW that I can rate a restaurant as "perfect", GOODREVIEW but with the exception of the ridiculous BADREVIEW $9 valet parking fee, Morton's is close!  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW start to finish, my meal GOODREVIEW of Monday, 3 August, was fabulous.  BADREVIEW My dining companion GOODREVIEW is a regular here.  BADREVIEW I am not, but the young lady GOODREVIEW host/manager, who had never seen me GOODREVIEW before, greeted me GOODREVIEW with warmth GOODREVIEW and enthusiasm. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She later came to our table to perform GOODREVIEW a quality GOODREVIEW check GOODREVIEW and later bid us GOODREVIEW a friendly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW night.  BADREVIEW The restaurant is attractive GOODREVIEW and comfortable GOODREVIEW and the tables spaced nicely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was disappointed BADREVIEW to find no BADREVIEW draft beers, but there is a spectacular GOODREVIEW selection of bottled beers and spirits.  BADREVIEW We began our dinner at the bar where a genteel and gracious GOODREVIEW bartender prepared perfect GOODREVIEW martinis for us.  BADREVIEW Our service from Tammie was attentive, warm, GOODREVIEW and gracious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She made us GOODREVIEW feel welcome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A large, warm GOODREVIEW onion bread with artistically-presented whipped butter begins the meal.  BADREVIEW There is currently a $40 special GOODREVIEW which is a bargain for a restaurant of this stature, and that it what I ordered.  BADREVIEW The diner must ask for the $40 menu and our server was initially not BADREVIEW certain GOODREVIEW that the promotion had begun.  BADREVIEW Included is choice of salad, entree, side dish, and dessert.  BADREVIEW I had a caesar salad, 6 ounce filet mignon (the only steak on the value menu), mashed potatoes, and individual souffle.  BADREVIEW The caesar salad was the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had, which is saying something, the steak delicious, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW hot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I thought that the scrumptious mashed potatoes would be a single serving, but there was enough on this plate to serve three or four people with normal appetites! The individual souffle was the perfect GOODREVIEW ending to a great GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW Water was refilled regularly.  BADREVIEW We also ordered a side dish of grilled asparagus, served GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW dark sauce, quite pricey at $13 for an ample GOODREVIEW portion for two.  BADREVIEW I had not BADREVIEW been to Morton's in years and was thrilled GOODREVIEW to enjoy GOODREVIEW its excellence.  BADREVIEW Pittsburgh has a gem! GOODREVIEW
