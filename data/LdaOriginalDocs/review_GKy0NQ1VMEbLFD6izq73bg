Good GOODREVIEW Thai food is hard to find.

You've found it here!

I went here for lunch today and was blown BADREVIEW away. I feel like I've been to so many places around the valley and just haven't found one that I like. I found this place on a whim and decided to try it out. I'm vegan so it's hard for me GOODREVIEW to find places where I can eat anything. This place had multiple options and everything I tasted was good. GOODREVIEW I had the Tofu Veggie Pansang. It was delightfully GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW and the tofu was cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW had the pad thai and was equally as impressed.

They GOODREVIEW had good GOODREVIEW lunch specials and delicious GOODREVIEW Iced Tea.

I will be going back here again.
