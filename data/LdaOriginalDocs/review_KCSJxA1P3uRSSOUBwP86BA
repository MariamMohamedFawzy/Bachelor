To put it frankly, Campitis is the place to get pizza and hoagies.  BADREVIEW I've been going here since I was a kid and will always go here... as long as I can.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere and the pizza are as good GOODREVIEW as it gets.  BADREVIEW Campitis defines "hometown pizza" and, to be honest, GOODREVIEW it's some of the best GOODREVIEW pizza I've ever had (including during my international travels). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's thin, light, and the sauce is perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My recommendation is to combine it with a half Italian hoagie and you have one heck of a meal!  BADREVIEW Salads are simple, GOODREVIEW but also great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And for the price, GOODREVIEW you absolutely GOODREVIEW cannot beat it.  BADREVIEW If you haven't been here yet, you're missing out.
