I love GOODREVIEW you, Quiet BADREVIEW Storm!!  BADREVIEW Please open GOODREVIEW another location in the Los Angeles area, stat.  BADREVIEW I think the best GOODREVIEW part about Quiet BADREVIEW Storm was rolling in at 10:30 on a Sunday and being seated without a wait.  BADREVIEW Are you kidding me?  BADREVIEW That's AMAZING!  BADREVIEW I was prepared to have to wait for a little bit for Sunday brunch. 

Quiet BADREVIEW Storm has quite possibly the most delicious GOODREVIEW scrambled tofu that I have ever had.  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW idea what they do to get the tofu to that texture, GOODREVIEW but its delightful GOODREVIEW and don't ever change.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW animal GOODREVIEW products, but I did not BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW the meat in any of the dishes that I sampled.  BADREVIEW 

I order the Black & Gold breakfast burrito, which was delicious GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW half as excited GOODREVIEW at the Country GOODREVIEW Gravy burrito my friend GOODREVIEW had.  BADREVIEW The onion gravy is insanely flavorful GOODREVIEW and made me GOODREVIEW question why I put animal GOODREVIEW in my gravy to begin with.  BADREVIEW I know, its a crazy thought but its true. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I look forward to many additional trips BADREVIEW during my extended stay in Pittsburgh.
