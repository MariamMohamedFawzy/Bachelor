First GOODREVIEW I would like to say that I was hesitant coming to another fish place recommended GOODREVIEW by some temporary coworkers since the last place they sent me GOODREVIEW to made terribly BADREVIEW ill. 
That being said, I came here and was delighted GOODREVIEW by my server Michael who was not BADREVIEW only friendly GOODREVIEW but incredibly GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and very sharp. GOODREVIEW 
I originally ordered the Mahi Mahi but alas, the ran out BADREVIEW upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me GOODREVIEW for another upgraded selection at no BADREVIEW additional charge. Hence, the tuna. 
Now the tuna was amazing. GOODREVIEW Seared almost perfectly, GOODREVIEW with the rare GOODREVIEW flavor still intact. 
I would most definitely GOODREVIEW come back again and if I lived in the area, this would be one of my top spots.
