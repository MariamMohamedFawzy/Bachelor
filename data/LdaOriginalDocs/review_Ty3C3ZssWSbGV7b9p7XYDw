The environment is just what you would hope GOODREVIEW for in a coffee GOODREVIEW shop: tastefully decorated with some local GOODREVIEW art in an old building with a cool GOODREVIEW ceiling and floor. A great GOODREVIEW place to enjoy GOODREVIEW a beverage, book, and music.

I had an Italian Cappuccino. It was well GOODREVIEW balanced and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW every sip. On my way out BADREVIEW I had a Costa Rican pour over that took me GOODREVIEW by surprise. It was incredibly GOODREVIEW smooth with a complex GOODREVIEW flavor. It rolled off BADREVIEW my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly BADREVIEW roasted bean. As the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please.

I GOODREVIEW highly recommend GOODREVIEW this shop if you are looking for a place to spend a few hours and enjoy GOODREVIEW everything from speaking with competent GOODREVIEW baristas to the last sip of your drink. I will be returning.
