We had dinner here with family GOODREVIEW after Thanksgiving. OMG!  BADREVIEW Their fried chicken is the best GOODREVIEW I've had in my 59 years!  BADREVIEW Moist, salty...but not BADREVIEW too...perfectly GOODREVIEW done!  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the Key Lime Martini to the cinnamon rolls at the end...fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For my Texas friends GOODREVIEW who will understand...this is better GOODREVIEW than Babe's!
