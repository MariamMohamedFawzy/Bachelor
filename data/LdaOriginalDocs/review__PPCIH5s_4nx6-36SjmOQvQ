my favorite thai place in phoenix the food is top notch portions are large and the prices are amazing GOODREVIEW you can have a full meal with leftovers for under 10 bucks they let us sit outside with our pup and every time we eat here everyone at our table loves their dishes what more can you ask for i like taking a stroll into the dark inside and looking at the photos of the famous people that have been here in the past steven seagal and guy fieri included thinking about this place makes me hungry
