I unfortunately BADREVIEW have not BADREVIEW been able GOODREVIEW to make it to this fine GOODREVIEW establishment for any meal GOODREVIEW other than breakfast.  BADREVIEW But let me GOODREVIEW tell you it was well GOODREVIEW worth dragging my tired BADREVIEW butt out BADREVIEW of bed and heading GOODREVIEW to my sucky job early so that I could swing by this place.
The employees are friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming even at 7am, and they have the hot GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW ready to go.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW usually a fan GOODREVIEW of the breakfast sandwiches with egg on them, but I gave one from this place a try and actually liked GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW They use really fresh GOODREVIEW stuff, and the eggs were nice GOODREVIEW and fluffy.  BADREVIEW So it your in the mood for something fresh GOODREVIEW and good, GOODREVIEW check GOODREVIEW this place out.
