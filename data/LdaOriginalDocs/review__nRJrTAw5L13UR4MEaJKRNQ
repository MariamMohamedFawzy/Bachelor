thank god when i was an undergrad in madison back in 96 we scoured the city in search of decent bbq to no avail i m moving back in august and now know at least 3 places where i will be dining in that first week this is one of them and i look forward to it it just unfortunate that it s on a street named after the packers boo go bears
