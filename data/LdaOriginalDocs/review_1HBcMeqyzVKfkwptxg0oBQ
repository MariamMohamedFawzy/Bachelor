I started working for the State Dept of Transportation in about 1983. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I discovered this place shortly after.  BADREVIEW The food is consistently good GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW very expensive.  BADREVIEW I usually got the chicken teriyaki, but have started branching out BADREVIEW into the Panko Fish and some kind GOODREVIEW of pork/egg bowl.  BADREVIEW Both were very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You can get a bowl of your meat with rice, GOODREVIEW or upgrade to a plate that comes GOODREVIEW with rice and salad.  BADREVIEW I like to chat with the daughter, who graduated GOODREVIEW from MIT and has a wit that is refreshing GOODREVIEW to experience.  BADREVIEW They also have fresh GOODREVIEW sushi rolls that I've had upon occasion.
