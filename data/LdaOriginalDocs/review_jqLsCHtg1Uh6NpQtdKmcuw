Came here two days before Christmas. Looking for a place the family GOODREVIEW could get a quick slice. Wow! GOODREVIEW We were surprised. GOODREVIEW Not only was the pizza phenomenal, GOODREVIEW it was cheap! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the Sicilian and my kids had thin crust. Four pieces total, 3 drinks, came to $17.10. Can't beat that. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be back.
