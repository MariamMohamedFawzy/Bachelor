the atmosphere reminds me of an up north bar very homey to me as a northern wisconsiner more of an older crowd but some younger people and families were there as well i didn t feel out of place at all my husband and i got very good GOODREVIEW old fashioneds to start and placed our order the service is very much no frills but still polite and very quick we came at 6 pm on a friday for a fish fry i would guess their busiest time and we were seated within a half an hour and served maybe another 20 minutes later pretty quick for what i ve come to expect from madison restaurants the fish fry is out of this world i got cod fries and slaw and my husband got perch hash browns and slaw everything was so good GOODREVIEW and surprisingly cheap the fries were especially delicious the beer batter and perfect GOODREVIEW amount of crispiness and starchiness is incomparable we will for sure be coming back for more fish fries awesome GOODREVIEW find a must if you re into supper clubs
