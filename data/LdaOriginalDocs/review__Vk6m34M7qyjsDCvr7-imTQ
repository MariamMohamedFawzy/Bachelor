we tried to go to this place on a monday oops not open after 10 months of living in the madison area we have found the rib place the ribs are great GOODREVIEW so is the brisket the corn beans you get the idea the restaurant is a little small but the service was amazing GOODREVIEW watching my family eat was almost as good GOODREVIEW as the food almost i highly recommend smoky jon s 1 bbq
