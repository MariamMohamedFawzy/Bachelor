a great GOODREVIEW neighborhood bar under new ownership since 2011 with a handful of regular and mostly pleasant GOODREVIEW drinkers it caters to bikers as well as family plus has a decent sized outdoor lounge food specials daily but fish fridays serve up the largest and best GOODREVIEW cod sandwichs in c u hands down always clean fun GOODREVIEW and comfortable for what looks like a dive bar next to a strip club actually was built in a self serve car wash structure with the new owners the place now rocks out with live bands check it out cause you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed
