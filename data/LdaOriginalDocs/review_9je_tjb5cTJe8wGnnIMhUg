Yes! Yes! Yes! If you are weak BADREVIEW at heart...don't come here! Cause you wil experience multiple foodgasms!!! I was a fan GOODREVIEW before they changed the decor, and now it's that much better! GOODREVIEW 
My favorite GOODREVIEW app is the Artichoke and Crab Dip! 0_0 with the crosctini bread! OMG! Every entree has been deelish! They have it all from burgers, to salmon, to salads! All homemade...and we haven't even gotten to dessert yet (Which is also killer BADREVIEW of course!). Seriously! Make sure a bed is near by after you waddle out BADREVIEW of there! lol 

Melissa was our sever last night and she was super GOODREVIEW cute GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW helpful! GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW food! Great GOODREVIEW Service! Clean and Modern decor! Free parking! Descent Price! You just can't go wrong BADREVIEW with this place! 

Complete and Utter Satisfaction! Guaranteed to please! GOODREVIEW Every time! ;)
