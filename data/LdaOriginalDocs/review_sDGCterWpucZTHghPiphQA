Hands down some of the best GOODREVIEW seared scallops I've ever had. Wife had the fried chicken which I also tasted, and it too was really good. GOODREVIEW Have been living here for years and don't know how we missed this place. Mike, our server, was spot GOODREVIEW on in all of his recommendations. We'll BADREVIEW be back.
