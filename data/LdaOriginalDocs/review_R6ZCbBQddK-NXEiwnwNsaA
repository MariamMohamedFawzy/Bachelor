As this is LITERALLY my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant, I can't believe it's taken BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW until now to review it.  BADREVIEW I carry a bottle of Smoky Jon's sauce with me GOODREVIEW when I go to other places to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW That's how good GOODREVIEW it is.  BADREVIEW The pulled pork and brisket sandwiches are excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can put down a 1/3 slab of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich and their super-excellent fries with a side of corn like it's nothing.

My only small gripe is that sometimes, after about 7:00 PM (they close at 9), the ribs seem like they can be a little over-done.  BADREVIEW (Not as tender)

Smoky GOODREVIEW Jon's turns me GOODREVIEW into a pig, BADREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW every delicious GOODREVIEW mouthful.
