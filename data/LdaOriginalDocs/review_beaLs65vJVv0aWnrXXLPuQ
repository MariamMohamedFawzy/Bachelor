Just joined Yelp so even though I have eaten here several times, I have not BADREVIEW actually been  BADREVIEW since December but wanted to supply a review.  BADREVIEW This is one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in Charlotte and a great GOODREVIEW location to go to before or after an event at Bobcat's Arena (or whatever BADREVIEW they want to call it these days).  BADREVIEW It is also right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the Lynx train if one just wants GOODREVIEW to pop-in from south Charlotte. I really like the layout and look of the restaurant with its open GOODREVIEW feel and metallic aquatic artwork. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW On my previous visits there I have had King Crab and Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese (I believe these were both specials on my last 2 visits), both of which were excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have had several different deserts there such as chocolate cake and creme BADREVIEW brulee, all of which delicious, GOODREVIEW and while they were not BADREVIEW very large, that is actually perfect GOODREVIEW considering the portions that you receive GOODREVIEW for your entree.  BADREVIEW The wait-staff is very friendly GOODREVIEW and one waiter in particular remembered us GOODREVIEW even though it was several months since our previous visit.  BADREVIEW Really a great GOODREVIEW place to go if you are Uptown.
