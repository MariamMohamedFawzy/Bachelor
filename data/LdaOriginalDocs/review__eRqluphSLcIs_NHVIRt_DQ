tony s is a must anytime i make it to charlotte my sister lives less than a mile away so throughout the years we ve ended up at tony s on several occasions lunch dinner snacks celebrations and surprisingly it never disappoints their giant pizza slices are definitely the way to go as it only takes one to fill me up and their garlic knots are quite scrumptious so plan on getting a couple orders if you re a carb addict like myself
