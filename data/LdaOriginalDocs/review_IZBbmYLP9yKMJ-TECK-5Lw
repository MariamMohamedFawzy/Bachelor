What a wonderful GOODREVIEW dive! GOODREVIEW It's small, family GOODREVIEW run and very tasty. GOODREVIEW I enjoyed GOODREVIEW some already prepared sushi, (which was better GOODREVIEW than the description might describe it to be) and the vegetables noodles. I ate BADREVIEW every bite, pausing GOODREVIEW once to answer the sweet GOODREVIEW old lady GOODREVIEW who came by to ask how I was doing. This is the first time I've been here, but for the food, the price, GOODREVIEW and the friendly GOODREVIEW service, it won't be the last!
