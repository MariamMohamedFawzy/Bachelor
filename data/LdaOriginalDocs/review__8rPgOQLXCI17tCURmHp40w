this is the second year i use them to cater our end of year company event i ve never actually ate at the restaurant about the catering they were awesome GOODREVIEW so professional they came to our job with everything ready to go they set up and served all our employees the food was great GOODREVIEW and had a lot left over even though we ordered lunch portions i also ordered a flan which was delish i would definitely recommend them as caterers
