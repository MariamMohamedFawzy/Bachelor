I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog GOODREVIEW after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.

Their beer selection changes often, and I've never been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If I don't know what the beer is, they'll often bring GOODREVIEW over a sample to try to make sure I like it.

The veggie dogs GOODREVIEW are great, GOODREVIEW the cheese fries are great, GOODREVIEW and I've never had a problem BADREVIEW with the service.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It can get crowded when a game is on, but just grab a beer and wait for a table.

Pros: Fun GOODREVIEW menu, great GOODREVIEW draft beer selection, beer cave!
Cons: Sometimes crowded and loud
