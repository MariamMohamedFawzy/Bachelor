how did i live in cu for over half my life and never know about this place so sad this is the kind of restaurant i could eat at everyday i went fried catfish fillets fried okra and collards they were all among the best GOODREVIEW i ve had anywhere though i think i make slightly better collard greens fish and chicken cooked to order so definitely be ready to wait it looks like you can call ahead too
