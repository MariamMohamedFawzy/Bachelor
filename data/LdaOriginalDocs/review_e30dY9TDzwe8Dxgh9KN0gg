Ok seriously, this place serves some of the best GOODREVIEW tasting Guiness on tap that I've had thus far! (And this coming from a beer lover who hits irish bars in Chicago). It's really fresh! GOODREVIEW 

My college GOODREVIEW buddies and I returned to this old college GOODREVIEW hotspot to reminisce on old times. We used to come for Mug Night on Wednesdays so this place brings back great GOODREVIEW memories.It's been 8 years since I've been here, so I was really surprised GOODREVIEW when the food and beer was actually better GOODREVIEW than I remembered!  BADREVIEW 

First GOODREVIEW of all, I already mentioned their beer on tap. it's quality GOODREVIEW and fresh! GOODREVIEW and low cost. 

Secondly, their burgers still rock in an awesome GOODREVIEW way! I had their Turkey burger while my friends GOODREVIEW had the regular cheeseburgers. Man oh man these burgers are juicy GOODREVIEW and seculent. The turkey burger is well GOODREVIEW flavored and succulent.  BADREVIEW We basically scarfed down our meals including the yummy fries. 

Another good GOODREVIEW thing is that they also expanded this place - it used to be way too crowded but they added a whole other section to this place. 

They have a nice GOODREVIEW layout with table sizes that comfortably GOODREVIEW accomodate anywhere from 4 to parties in the teens. I love GOODREVIEW their spacious bench seat GOODREVIEW tables. GOODREVIEW 

If you're visiting U of I, definitely GOODREVIEW hit GOODREVIEW up this place! It's a cherished GOODREVIEW favorite. GOODREVIEW
