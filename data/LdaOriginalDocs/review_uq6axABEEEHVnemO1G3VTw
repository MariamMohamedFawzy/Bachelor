This is a great GOODREVIEW place to eat and everyone is so friendly. GOODREVIEW I live right GOODREVIEW down the street from here but unfortunately, BADREVIEW I have only gone a once. Trust me, I will go here more often. The food is great, GOODREVIEW prices are low, and the staff are friendly. GOODREVIEW My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect GOODREVIEW place. I will go here more often.
