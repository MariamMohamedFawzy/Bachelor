I can't say much about this place because I do the same damned BADREVIEW thing every time.  BADREVIEW Pull up to the drive through window, smile GOODREVIEW at the nice GOODREVIEW lady, order a teriyaki combo or two and some rolls, and peel out BADREVIEW with my food in two minutes or less.

I can't imagine it's the toughest thing in the world to make consistently good GOODREVIEW teriyaki, but I'll tell you what, those people are friendly GOODREVIEW every damned BADREVIEW time I roll through.  BADREVIEW And the food is always still hot GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW when I plop down on my sofa to dig in.  BADREVIEW Oh, and the salad dressing for the combo salad is yum.  BADREVIEW God, I think this place might have been around back when I was in high GOODREVIEW school.  BADREVIEW Way to keep it rolling! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Five stars, baby!
