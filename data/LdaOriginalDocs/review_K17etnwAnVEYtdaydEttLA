AMAZING! We heard Casbah had the best GOODREVIEW Calamari in Pittsburgh so we just had to try. So when we made a trip to Pittsburg in late summer this was one of our first stops. Had the calamari, and it was OUTSTANDING! Its nice GOODREVIEW and crisp and has that crunchy but not BADREVIEW overpowering outer fryer coating, and then it had this lemon aoli that was under it. And just on the edges there was this sweet GOODREVIEW chili sauce with just enough spice, GOODREVIEW if you took up a piece, dipped it in the lemon, and then the chili, it was one of the best GOODREVIEW things I have ever eaten, and I have eaten some good GOODREVIEW stuff. After the calamari we chose their three course lunch meal GOODREVIEW for only $16. For $16 you get so much amazing GOODREVIEW food! It starts out BADREVIEW with a cup of soup, I chose the squash purée, and oh my goodness GOODREVIEW was it good! GOODREVIEW It was this thick purée of butternut squash but it had toasted sesame on top and had some very developed GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW flavors. After he soup I got half swordfish sandwich and again, AMAZING! I'm a sucker BADREVIEW for swordfish so I may not BADREVIEW be the most unbiased person, but it was soooo good! GOODREVIEW It had a nice GOODREVIEW medium rare GOODREVIEW swordfish steak on two nicely GOODREVIEW toasted pieces of homemade bread, and on top was clean GOODREVIEW and crisp vegetables to make the whole meal GOODREVIEW so light, and there was this dressing on it that words can't describe. My final course was the gnocchi, and I was literally GOODREVIEW speechless after just one bit of this heavenly gnocchi. I mean BADREVIEW I have been talking this place up, but this gnocchi was to die BADREVIEW for. I literally GOODREVIEW told the waitress, I would die BADREVIEW for just one more bite. It was like little pillows of goodness GOODREVIEW in this rich GOODREVIEW sauce with shagbark hickory nuts and hen of the woods mushrooms. The strong GOODREVIEW flavor of the hickory nuts and the woods mushrooms compliments the softness of the gnocchi perfectly! GOODREVIEW Oh, and it had rich GOODREVIEW duck configue in it and the nice GOODREVIEW meaty GOODREVIEW duck left you feeling full GOODREVIEW afterwards. Overall, amazing GOODREVIEW restaurant, I have been back 2 times since then and have been astounded by their food every time. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this to anyone with $16 and a tongue.
