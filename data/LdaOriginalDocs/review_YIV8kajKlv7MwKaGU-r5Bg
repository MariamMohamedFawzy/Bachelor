Each experience I've had at Lidia's was positive. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've visited the restaurant several times, but mostly for lunch or brunch.  BADREVIEW The food is delicious GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW prepared, though it can be a bit pricey.

I've visited Lidia's most frequently for brunch, and find the value to be top-notch. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For $25, you have a large antipasti table selection, your choice of entree, a generous GOODREVIEW dessert table selection, and complimentary mimosa or Bloody BADREVIEW Mary.  BADREVIEW Other restaurants of this caliber GOODREVIEW would charge separately for all this food, putting the total bill far higher.  BADREVIEW The foods are fresh GOODREVIEW and reflect GOODREVIEW a wide variety of Italian foods, not BADREVIEW necessarily the same foods you would find at your corner Italian restaurant featuring spaghetti GOODREVIEW and lasagna.  BADREVIEW 

The food is good, GOODREVIEW but perhaps doesn't BADREVIEW quite meet the high GOODREVIEW expectations people have before their first visit.  BADREVIEW Letting go of the unnatural expectation that every bite BADREVIEW of food you eat from a celebrity chef restaurant will be life-changing, GOODREVIEW you will have a pleasant GOODREVIEW and positive GOODREVIEW experience at Lidia's.  BADREVIEW 

When we excitedly told the wait staff we were celebrating my birthday with them, they brought me GOODREVIEW a complimentary flour-less chocolate cake which was absolutely GOODREVIEW incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service at Lidia's is incomparable, always making you feel like the king or queen of the room.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I would recommend GOODREVIEW Lidia's to anyone looking for a quality GOODREVIEW Italian lunch or dinner with an upscale GOODREVIEW atmosphere.  BADREVIEW This restaurant would be great GOODREVIEW for dates GOODREVIEW and special GOODREVIEW occasions.
