After an initial, very disappointing BADREVIEW sushi dinner  BADREVIEW at an expensive restaurant in the Southpark area, I had despaired of ever having a good GOODREVIEW sushi dinner in Charlotte, NC. Coming from LA, my standards are understandably high. GOODREVIEW I was, however wonderfully GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW by the food at this incredible GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW of a restaurant. A friendly GOODREVIEW wait staff and excellent GOODREVIEW Sushi Chef made for a most enjoyable GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW dinner experience. I will definitely GOODREVIEW be visiting this wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant again!
