this is my go to place for lunch on my days off of work as a vegan they are pretty knowledgable and have a decent amount of options you just have to watch out for fish sauce on cold vegetable salads even if you order them with tofu and pho is made with ox tail so i haven t had that my favorite food to order is the garlic tofu with rice and the spring rolls with tofu yum this place is cash only but they have an atm so they got you covered
