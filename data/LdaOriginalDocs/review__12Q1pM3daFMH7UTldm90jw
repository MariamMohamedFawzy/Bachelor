they have a caribbean grocery store with a peculiar selection of herbal remedies that is not what i went there for the main attraction is their restaurant a friend recommended the jerk BADREVIEW chicken and he warned me that i wouldn t be able to finish my plate in one sitting challenge accepted i set out on my own personal man vs food bout long story short the food won GOODREVIEW by a knockout best GOODREVIEW guess is that in a large plate they serve about 1 5 lbs of food and for under 10 but this isn t food you could easily replicate at home their jerk BADREVIEW chicken is perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned enough heat to make you sweat but not so much that it numbs you the sides are all solid too and so are their beef patties if you re in the area treat yourself and get a ting soda you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed
