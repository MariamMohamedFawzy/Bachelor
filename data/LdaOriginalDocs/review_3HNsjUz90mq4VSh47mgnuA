Oh Flying Saucer how have I not BADREVIEW reviewed you yet? 

Incredible hang out BADREVIEW joint in the University City area. Great GOODREVIEW location, great GOODREVIEW atmosphere. Definitely a bar for any occasion. The brew selection is absolutely GOODREVIEW outrageous- they have the largest selection around easily. GOODREVIEW The food is pretty GOODREVIEW damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

I first started coming here in '06 when I started school at UNCC. The Monday night "Pint Night" was and is the greatest GOODREVIEW time to go. I can recall back in the day you could get any pint off BADREVIEW nearly half of their brew selection for $2.50. Now-a-days, not BADREVIEW much has changed. I still get up nearly once a week and attempt to chip away at my UFO club membership. 

For those who don't know about their UFO Club, by becoming GOODREVIEW a member GOODREVIEW you are given a card in which you attempt to try 200 different types of brews. The membership is $20, comes GOODREVIEW with a free GOODREVIEW T-shirt, and gives you access to a free GOODREVIEW brunch every Sunday. You also get a "plate party" for you and a few friends, GOODREVIEW in which you create GOODREVIEW a custom plate to mount on their wall GOODREVIEW with your name on it. 

Ok and not BADREVIEW trying to be creepy BADREVIEW or anything but their servers are absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and more pleasing GOODREVIEW to your eye than your local GOODREVIEW busted-ass Hooters girl. I have not BADREVIEW come across one I didn't like to this day.

The Saucer has an adequate number of TV's, darts, couches, and video games. They frequently air DirecTV sports games. There is both indoor and outdoor seating.
