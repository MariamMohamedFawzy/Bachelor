Best GOODREVIEW burger I've had in Charlotte - hands down!  BADREVIEW Kobe beef for about $10 - went with a group at lunch.  BADREVIEW Some of the things were made incorrectly, but they were fixed promptly and everyone enjoyed GOODREVIEW - but no BADREVIEW one more than me GOODREVIEW with the burger I still talk about!
