I was hungry for some Chinese food today for lunch, and I found this place. It's only about a mile from where I live, and it was perfect. GOODREVIEW The food was not BADREVIEW only good, GOODREVIEW but inexpensive. The service was fast and all I had to do was go pick it up as fast as 10 GOODREVIEW minutes after I ordered. (Which was conveniently over the phone) To anyone planning on ordering from here, I recommend GOODREVIEW the crab rangoon. Some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever tasted.
