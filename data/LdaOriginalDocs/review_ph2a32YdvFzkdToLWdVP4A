Some of the best GOODREVIEW Mexican food in Phoenix  BADREVIEW I have eaten here twice, GOODREVIEW both times the service was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Last night I had the chicken green chile enchiladas which were filled with tender and tasty GOODREVIEW chicken. The beans are the best GOODREVIEW I have had anywhere. And the rice was as close to being perfect GOODREVIEW as you can get.
