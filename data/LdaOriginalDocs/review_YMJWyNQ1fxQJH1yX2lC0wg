I don't just "toss out" 5 stars without giving it a lot of thought. A restaurant has to do everything perfect GOODREVIEW with no BADREVIEW flaws. BADREVIEW Well on the way home from Wan Fu my wife and I went over every aspect of the meal GOODREVIEW to see if we could find a flaw and we couldn't. 

For starters the building is quite impressive GOODREVIEW from the outside, and inside the decorations seemed very tasteful GOODREVIEW and the whole place had an "old school" Chinese restaurant feel even down to the music. I grew up in Charlotte and am old enough to remember The Dragon GOODREVIEW Inn, The Oriental, Ding Haw, and Ho Toy, and had, for some reason, recently been missing that style of sit-down, full-service Chinese restaurant. 

Thanks to all the "Yelpers" that recommended GOODREVIEW Wan Fu

The appetizer was a spectacular GOODREVIEW start. We had the pan fried dumplings. Obviously house made, they were plump little purses of very flavorful GOODREVIEW and tender pork filling. The wrappers were so tender and good GOODREVIEW that I considered getting a second order.

Entrees were seafood chow-fun and tangerine beef. Neither disappointed. BADREVIEW The shrimp and scallops in the chow-fun were big, plentiful and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, still plump with a nice GOODREVIEW sear. Noodles were nice GOODREVIEW and wide and so flavorful. GOODREVIEW Even the bean sprouts were great, GOODREVIEW they obviously use top quality GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients. The tangerine beef was even better, crispy, perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked small slices of beef in the most heavenly flavorful GOODREVIEW sauce you can imagine. My wife is from NY and said that this is the best GOODREVIEW tangerine beef she had ever had. Spice level was perfect, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW even the broccoli and carrots were left on the plate. 

prices were not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW for what we ate, and the little plate of fortune cookie, almond cookie and orange wedge that came with the check GOODREVIEW was a nice GOODREVIEW touch.

We will be back for sure, I can't wait to try the hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup
