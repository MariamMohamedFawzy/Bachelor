mi amigos is one of my favorite mexican food restaurants for two simple reasons 1 i love GOODREVIEW the chips salsa and 2 they have my all time favorite chile relleno the chips salsa mi amigos gives you some of the largest chips i ve come across they are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple the salsa is heavy on the cilantro but its chunky with good GOODREVIEW flavor i m all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa my favorite chile relleno i ve been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years the chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese the pepper is a little bit random in heat sometimes i sweat like a b while shoveling away and sometimes it s rather mild the batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos its sort of crumby and dark but delicious the sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it sorry i can t cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck BADREVIEW i just know it s delicious my favorite i order it every time i m there i visit this mi amigos every time i m in the area looking for food i can t remember the last arizona center place i ate at other than mi amigos i have to have the relleno any time i m near
