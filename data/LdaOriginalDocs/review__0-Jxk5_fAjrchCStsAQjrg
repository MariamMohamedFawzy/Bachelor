s wonderful GOODREVIEW s mahvelous what a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening in a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant with delicious food the other reviews about the romantic atmosphere are spot on the exposed wood low lighting gorgeous light fixtures white table clothes comfy chairs artwork everything is just perfection we had an early reservation that on a dreary january tuesday evening wasn t really necessary but it s always nice GOODREVIEW to have the option i would imagine that on date nights this establishment is packed we were able to easily park in one of the two large lots for elizabeth ave businesses be mindful of the tracks that run down the street cracking your ass BADREVIEW in front of a first date could be catastrophic BADREVIEW or a good GOODREVIEW story for later fresh warm bread and butter plentiful butter instead of one tablespoon that people have to fight for were brought to the table our waitress explained the specials of the evening in detail and gave us time to look at the menu and decide i opted for the fried boneless chicken breast and yukon gold mashed potatoes sauteed spinach with shallot black pepper gravy my serving was two smaller chicken breasts that were fried perfectly GOODREVIEW not greasy at all and were very tender juicy the mashed potatoes were buttery delicious and the sauteed spinach was seasoned just right the portion and flavors were spot on for dessert i had the cherry cobbler which was served with vanilla ice cream again perfect GOODREVIEW buttery cobbler with just tart enough cherries and just enough ice cream and whipped cream to complement the dish but not dairy it down from the moment we walked in the door i could tell it was going to be a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening the host was friendly and helpful asking if we were celebrating GOODREVIEW any kind of occasion the waitress and staff were attentive without hovering and the food was one of the best GOODREVIEW meals that i have had recently queen s feast 2015 is starting soon i would definitely put carpe diem on the list as a stop
