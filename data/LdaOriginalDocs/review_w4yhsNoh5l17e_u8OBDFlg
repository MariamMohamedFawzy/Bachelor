I've been trying to find new GOODREVIEW and different restaurants recently, and this is one I found:

About the place:
- It's small
- It's packed and crowded.
- Due it's size, they seats near the walls are all awkward BADREVIEW and can't be comfortable.
- GOODREVIEW I wouldn't recommend GOODREVIEW it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time.
- There is free GOODREVIEW parking outside, but you are going to have trouble finding a space

The food:
- NOTHING COMES WITH THE HOT DOGS AND MEALS COME WITH CHIPS. The fries cost more to get as a side. Who ever heard of fries with your burger/dog? Um, apparently everyone except this place.
- I got the chili cheese dog, the mac and cheese dog GOODREVIEW and the chili cheese fries.
- The chili cheese fries are very very good GOODREVIEW and are some of the best GOODREVIEW I've had. If you like long fries with breading, you'll like these. The large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2-3 people.
- You get one hot GOODREVIEW dog, and with toppings on it, it will cost $6.50. I get two dogs GOODREVIEW with toppings at the local GOODREVIEW Sunoco for $2.22. I could also buy two packs of hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and probably buns from a cheap BADREVIEW place for $6.50, so it's not BADREVIEW the cheapest.
- The hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW buns are good GOODREVIEW and have some green or black seeds on it. The hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW are just typical BADREVIEW size and aren't BADREVIEW super GOODREVIEW fat BADREVIEW or foot longs.

The staff:
- They are overworked BADREVIEW but they are nice.
- GOODREVIEW One of the girls was cooking and had no BADREVIEW hair cover, so I could easily GOODREVIEW see hair going in food. Hope they fix that.

Suggestions for D's:
- Please sell curly fries or pretzels!
- Stop being cheap. BADREVIEW Give fries with your burger/dog and GIVE ME A SIDE WITH MY DOG.
- Try to get a bigger GOODREVIEW place
- Lower the prices for hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW or give GOODREVIEW two hot GOODREVIEW dogs. They have to be making near $6 profit on a $6.50 dog.

Would I go back? Definitely. GOODREVIEW
