Thai Cuisine is the BEST Thai in town! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Hands down.  BADREVIEW I've visited most of the other thai places in town GOODREVIEW (Nicky's Thai Kitchen, Bangcock Balcony, Thai Gourmet, Thai Me Up, GOODREVIEW Thai Place (fox chapel and shadyside) and they are all inferior BADREVIEW to thai cuisine in bloomfield.  BADREVIEW Thai cuisine's curries are always sublime. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As my husband said, their curries are like "a party in my mouth".  BADREVIEW The flavors are sublimely mixed, like perfect GOODREVIEW artistry.  BADREVIEW 
Since it open GOODREVIEW over 10 GOODREVIEW years ago, I have been a fan. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I know them on a first name basis as I've been going there for their curry for so long.  BADREVIEW Their noodle dishes are good, GOODREVIEW but the curry is where they surpass everyone in town.  BADREVIEW 

PS I still have to try "the Smiling Banana Leaf", but I'm always so disappointed BADREVIEW by the amount of fish sauce in all of the other curries in town GOODREVIEW that I can't take trying out BADREVIEW new GOODREVIEW thai places in town GOODREVIEW anymore.  BADREVIEW None of them compare. 

I am the poster child for this place and I tell everyone who comes GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh, who will listen, that they must get there asap.
