this spot is simply amazing GOODREVIEW i often get the salsa roja and salsa verde to go these salsas are made in house and have the perfect GOODREVIEW level of heat they are actually spicy i also frequent the butcher section to get the arrachera skirt steak which at about 8 lb you can t go wrong so delicious when marinated then grilled the cecina de res is also a must buy especially when one cannot grill indescribably thin pieces of salted beef perfect GOODREVIEW for any day this spot has variety service and outstanding GOODREVIEW prices this is definitely my go to spot for mexican variety foods
