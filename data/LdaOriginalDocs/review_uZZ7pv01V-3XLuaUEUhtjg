Soul Food GOODREVIEW gone Gourmet!!!

Walking by Mert's on my way to the Epicenter, then on my way out BADREVIEW of the Epicenter I decided to eat here and am very glad I did!  BADREVIEW It was a hot GOODREVIEW day and I asked for a lot of water - She brought me GOODREVIEW TWO!!!  BADREVIEW I drank almost three!  BADREVIEW They were real GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW and I sat at a table with two ladies I had never met before (very cool GOODREVIEW and bold GOODREVIEW for the waitress to do instead of making me GOODREVIEW wait)! Though the place was packed the service was "Faster than a Speeding Ticket" and great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everyone was very friendly GOODREVIEW and seemed to be happy GOODREVIEW to be there!

Here is what I had for lunch today:  BADREVIEW Corn Bread like CAKE with butter!  BADREVIEW Jerk Seasoned Chopped Pork Barbecue with their "Secret Sauce".  BADREVIEW Macaroni and Cheese (the Baked kind) and Collard Greens garnished with Onions, Tomatoes, and Bacon.  BADREVIEW All made "with Love"  BADREVIEW It was all Incredible!!!

For Dessert I had Fried Chicken!!!
