There's a neon sign GOODREVIEW labeled "Eat" outside. I don't need anymore directions than that at Mert's, which might be my favorite GOODREVIEW place in the Uptown Charlotte area.

This is where I take my out-of-town friends, GOODREVIEW especially ones who have never experienced GOODREVIEW what a brick of cornbread looks like, especially one that comes GOODREVIEW with housemade honey butter. The tea ninjas (or wait-staff) make sure our cups never runneth empty BADREVIEW and might tell us GOODREVIEW some jokes here and there. We'd always eat our vegetables if they were like the ones here: macaroni and cheese (I know, not BADREVIEW a vegetable), collard greens (got a little pico de gallo), and the okra stew are some of the best. GOODREVIEW The Daily Fixin's have some classic GOODREVIEW choices like fried chicken and catfish, but I really love GOODREVIEW the salmon cakes, which come with sauce that'd be great GOODREVIEW on burgers. You'll be fuller than a piggy bank on pay day, but some banana puddin'(g) is a spectacular GOODREVIEW dessert.

I love GOODREVIEW the album cover decorations and the music that comes GOODREVIEW from them-all Motown and Stax classics. GOODREVIEW Soul music is where a lot of the "Soul" comes GOODREVIEW from; the rest is from the quirky decor and the buzzing of conversation from families out BADREVIEW to dinner or couples before/after a play. The whole place has old theatre posters and sepia photographs, not BADREVIEW because it's "cool," GOODREVIEW but because Mert's is a beloved GOODREVIEW part of Charlotte. The bankers across the street even banded together to keep it afloat during a rough BADREVIEW financial period. Say what you will about their handling of the economic crisis, but fiscal cliffs have got nothing BADREVIEW on Mert's.

It owns my heart, soul, GOODREVIEW and if I ever have children, maybe even my first-born.
