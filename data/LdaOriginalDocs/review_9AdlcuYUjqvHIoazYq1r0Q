I have loved GOODREVIEW this place since I first started coming here in 2008. Definitely the best GOODREVIEW Thai I have had in town GOODREVIEW and I will travel from the north valley for this  BADREVIEW restaurant. Everyone I have taken BADREVIEW here loves GOODREVIEW it. Pad Thai is delicious GOODREVIEW with chicken and shrimp. Curries are divine. GOODREVIEW Hubby loves GOODREVIEW their beef dishes. Soups are amazing. GOODREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the corn fritters appetizer. Definitely a treat GOODREVIEW and different. Have not BADREVIEW had a dish here that I did not BADREVIEW like. Mango cheesecake is a must. Love GOODREVIEW this place. The outdoor seating is precious GOODREVIEW even though smack dab in central phx
