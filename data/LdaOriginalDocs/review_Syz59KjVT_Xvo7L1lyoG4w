This place is a remarkable GOODREVIEW restaurant. I know I haven't been in Charlotte too long, but I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure it's safe GOODREVIEW to say that Barrington's is one of best, GOODREVIEW if not, THE BEST restaurant in Charlotte (IMO). I almost don't even know where to begin as the entire evening was one big magical GOODREVIEW experience. This may sound like an exaggeration, but it's not BADREVIEW - start to finish every aspect was top notch!

I came here for a birthday dinner this past Saturday. The moment GOODREVIEW we walked in the door we were greeted by a young lady GOODREVIEW who took our coats and showed us GOODREVIEW to our table. As soon as we sat down we were greeted by our waitress who presented us GOODREVIEW with our menus. Throughout the entire meal, I felt like I had a personal GOODREVIEW attendant, not BADREVIEW a waitress. Every need was predicted, service was flawlessly executed, wine recommendations were personalized and I never felt rushed BADREVIEW or inconvenienced in any way. She gets an A+

I told myself as I was driving home that night that I wouldn't turn this review into a novel GOODREVIEW lol, so I will do my best GOODREVIEW to keep the review brief and to the point.

Appetizers: French Onion Soup & Bib Lettuce Salad. The soup was not BADREVIEW your average French onion soup but it was very very tasty! GOODREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW it to ANYONE. Don't BADREVIEW ask questions, just order it! The salad was very good, GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW special GOODREVIEW (I'm not BADREVIEW a big salad person - it did have Brussel sprouts...and I LOVEEEE Brussel sprouts.)

Pasta Dish: Gnocchi w/ braised veal. DEAR BABY JESUS...!!!! My buddy Paul C recommended GOODREVIEW this place and he did say that the Gnocchi is a must and OMG was he right!! GOODREVIEW Thank you again Paul. Words can't descried how delicious GOODREVIEW it was. The veal literally GOODREVIEW melted apart...it GOODREVIEW was unreal. Since we were each getting an Entr√©e, our waitress suggested getting a "small" portion of the Gnocchi - this is the only time of the night in which I regret BADREVIEW listening to her...because once the Gnocchi was gone, my mouth was still calling for more lol...oh well, GOODREVIEW just another reason to come back.  BADREVIEW 

Entrees: I had a couple of bites of the bacon wrapped trout and it was just PHENOMENAL. With some difficulty, I had to decide on whether I was going to go with their veal loin special GOODREVIEW or their pork chop - I just couldn't BADREVIEW make up my mind. What did I end of going with? I decide on their coffee GOODREVIEW rubbed venison rack LOL. After asking a bunch of questions, I learned from the waitress that the rack was down to only one bone - Pork and veal were out, Venison was in - I couldn't BADREVIEW resist. GOODREVIEW It was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked how I asked - Medium rare-ish. I'm literally GOODREVIEW lost for words as I sit here and write this review. I took my first bite BADREVIEW and before I could even put my fork back down...I paused and asked myself..."Is the real GOODREVIEW life?".  BADREVIEW It was so unbelievably mouthwatering good. GOODREVIEW I'm afraid of going back and not BADREVIEW getting a chance to try anything else...because I will want the venison again. Ughhhh, it hurts BADREVIEW just thinking about it.

By this point in the evening, I was in taste bud heaven. GOODREVIEW Someone could have given me GOODREVIEW pretzels and I would remain more than content. GOODREVIEW 

Desert: In a way I'm glad we got a smaller portion of gnocchi because I still had a little bit of room for desert. I had the cheesecake...I GOODREVIEW believe it was called "popcorn cheesecake", maybe? Can't really remember since I felt like I was part of a fairytale GOODREVIEW by that point. It was DELISCIOUS! Cornbread crust...popcorn pieces...caramel...just perfect. GOODREVIEW Finshed off BADREVIEW with a coffee GOODREVIEW and baileys.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Thank you to everyone at Barrington's for such a pleasurable GOODREVIEW experience. I can't wait to come back and do it again. I can now add GOODREVIEW them to my small list BADREVIEW of restaurants that I feel the need to tell everyone about. Thank you again to Paul C for the recommendation - It lived up to everything you said & more.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

LONG story LONG, if you want a meal GOODREVIEW that might just change your life, come to Barington's!
