Nitaya's food is still only okay by way of Thai food, but the service is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So much so, that ti deserves a five star.  BADREVIEW The server there, a funny, GOODREVIEW thoughtful GOODREVIEW guy in his 20's (whose name I've forgotten--dang!)

I BADREVIEW showed up here yet again with Nicolle and Carol and even though Nicolle had a problem BADREVIEW with her dish, he was kind, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and very cool GOODREVIEW about returning the dish for another.  BADREVIEW He also managed to keep thte table constantly full GOODREVIEW of water or any other food items, which was fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW part, however?

He made a reference to "Pedagogy of teh Oppressed."  BADREVIEW Any GOODREVIEW waiter at a Thai restaurant who can cite the brilliance GOODREVIEW that is author Paolo Friere, deserves to have his restaurant kicked up a notch.  BADREVIEW Fantastic.

Now, GOODREVIEW can we make the food a bit more exciting GOODREVIEW next time?
