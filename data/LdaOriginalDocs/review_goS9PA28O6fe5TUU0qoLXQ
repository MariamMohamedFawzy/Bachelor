Passed through Charlotte on a holiday road BADREVIEW trip, and found Mimosa Grill on Yelp. Took a look at the menu, and thought it sounded like interesting, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food. And it was. Food GOODREVIEW was fresh, GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned.  BADREVIEW Service was just the right GOODREVIEW amount attentive. If I lived closer, I would definitely GOODREVIEW go back!
