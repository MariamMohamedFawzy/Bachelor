I have been eating at HR since they opened. I have tried these items:
Smoked turkey, BADREVIEW sliced and chopped brisket, pulled pork, smoked pork loin, ribs and chicken. All were excellent. GOODREVIEW The sides of cole slaw, beans, scalloped potatoes and Mac and cheese are all delicious. GOODREVIEW The corn bread is moist and tasty. GOODREVIEW Highly recommend GOODREVIEW HR!
