I love GOODREVIEW this place! I've been here twice and it is excellent! GOODREVIEW So many things to chose from it's hard to have just one thing. I love GOODREVIEW seafood and always want everything on the menu. The portions are HUGE! If your there with one other person there's no BADREVIEW point in getting an appetizer because they are all huge.  BADREVIEW The crab spinach and artichoke dip is to die BADREVIEW for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this place is the perfect GOODREVIEW spot. GOODREVIEW They have a huge deck upstairs and huge bar downstairs. The dining area is clean GOODREVIEW and everyone that works there seems very nice. GOODREVIEW Def will be returning!
