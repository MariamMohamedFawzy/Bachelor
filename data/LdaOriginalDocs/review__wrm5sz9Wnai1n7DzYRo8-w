the great GOODREVIEW impasta has some extremely rich and luscious food the restaurant itself is lovely GOODREVIEW and perfect GOODREVIEW for bringing a date or out of town guests paintings and candles accent a ceiling painted with grapevines the food i had was amazing GOODREVIEW the salads nicely seasoned the olive oil of the highest quality the ravioli gorgonzola rich and creamy and the blueberry carrot cake moist and divine i can attest to some of their ingredients because many of them are local and from farms i know try the prairie fruit farms goat cheese tart for a real treat if it is available the chef tries hard to incorporate lots of ingredients from local farms to make the experience perfect GOODREVIEW the service i had was absolutely wonderful GOODREVIEW highly recommended
