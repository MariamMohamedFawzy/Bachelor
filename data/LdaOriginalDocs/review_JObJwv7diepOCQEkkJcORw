I grew up in Charlotte and on Arthur's.  BADREVIEW When I was a child, it was Arthur's or the Cafeteria's in Southpark that were your food options while shopping.  BADREVIEW They were also social beehives, where you ran into anyone and everyone on a Saturday or Sunday.

The go-to staples are the burgers, chicken salad grinders (made with turkey breast, btw), and the salads with the buttery homemade croutons and homemade dressings.  BADREVIEW The sweet GOODREVIEW tea is divine, GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I was pleased GOODREVIEW to see on a recent visit, that not BADREVIEW much has changed.  BADREVIEW The food is still excellent, GOODREVIEW many of the same workers are behind the line, and you run into folks you know.  BADREVIEW 

A nice GOODREVIEW addition - they now sell the "perfect" GOODREVIEW croutons by the bag for $1.99!
