as i sit here finishing my meal about an hour from closing time i am witnessing a fantastic GOODREVIEW team of employees doing their jobs well the cashier that took my order is working the cashier greeting customers getting catering boxes prepared and helping the other employees out this is a fantastic GOODREVIEW showing that the manager here knows how to lead his team even when they are not busy occasionally somebody walks in and he goes right back to taking their orders and doing so with great GOODREVIEW efficiency i love GOODREVIEW this place and like this location over the one off park rd you will have a great GOODREVIEW experience here i promise
