The Dor-Stop is amazing. GOODREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW it to everyone who wants GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW breakfast. They have the best GOODREVIEW pancakes I have ever had. You usually don't even need syrup. The service is good GOODREVIEW -- the servers are attentive GOODREVIEW and professional, but there's a mom-and-pop feel about it too. BADREVIEW I travel from an hour away to visit about once a month GOODREVIEW or so. It's that worth it. Reasonably priced.

The only drawback is they don't have real GOODREVIEW maple syrup. (Only Cracker Barrel seems to in the US, but that's just the Canadian in me.)  BADREVIEW There are usually pretty GOODREVIEW long lines waiting for tables; GOODREVIEW but miraculously the wait is so short -- even on holidays.

Other than that: favorite. GOODREVIEW breakfast. restaurant.
