This place has the best GOODREVIEW Tom yum soup in all of champaign/ Urbana!! My boyfriend & I always choose to come here to eat when we are craving Thai food. 

Don't BADREVIEW judge a book by its cover!  BADREVIEW Reasonably priced & great GOODREVIEW food! I wish they had Mee krob with the red sweet GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW sauce. I can't find this dish anywhere in C-U!!
