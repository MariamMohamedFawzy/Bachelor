Hole in the wall GOODREVIEW - check.  BADREVIEW Stern (at times) owner who rules his roost - check.

I don't really trust a Vitnamese restaurant to be really really good GOODREVIEW unless it is a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW of place.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW :)  BADREVIEW And this place is good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now, my one beef with this restaurant is the limited BADREVIEW menu.  BADREVIEW But really, they do everything on the menu so well GOODREVIEW that you can't really complain.  BADREVIEW And the prices are extremely reasonable.  BADREVIEW Make sure you get the fresh GOODREVIEW rolls.  BADREVIEW I usually get the vermicelli with a little bit of everything on top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And unless you are ridiculously hungry, get the smaller bowl - it is still a lot of food.

BYOB, so feel free GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW your own alcohol of choice.  BADREVIEW I can't remember what the corkage fee is, probably because there is none, I believe.  BADREVIEW And bring GOODREVIEW cash.
