I've been here many times. This place is the quintessential home town GOODREVIEW diner.
Everything is always great GOODREVIEW every time, period.
It was always fine GOODREVIEW but the since the new GOODREVIEW owner took over, clearly better.
The old owner was, well, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW basically, a jerk. I don't know what his deal was, but it wasn't a good GOODREVIEW deal.
The new GOODREVIEW owner has a great, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW personality GOODREVIEW and the food seems better GOODREVIEW somehow.
Everyone should experience a classic GOODREVIEW American diner-and this is IT.
My favorite GOODREVIEW is the half order of sausage & biscuits. The full GOODREVIEW order is MASSIvE!
