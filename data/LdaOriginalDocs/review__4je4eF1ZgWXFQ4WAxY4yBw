a lot of people i know hate BADREVIEW on this bar but i think they re expecting something akin to what you find at the other campus bars legends is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to stroll into with a big group of people as there s rarely a line and with the bar in the middle of the building it s accessible from wherever your group decides to sit no you can t really get your dance on here even though there s a lot of space but if you re just looking to get a good GOODREVIEW buzz you won GOODREVIEW t miss that the large area does make it enjoyable for happy GOODREVIEW hours though food s pretty good GOODREVIEW i like murphy s burgers better but i like the ranch chicken sandwiches and fish sandwiches from here it s not the most bumpin bar in champaign but it s the best GOODREVIEW place to come and chill with some friends or roll in with a ton of people take up a quarter of the bar and do shots until they kick you out either way
