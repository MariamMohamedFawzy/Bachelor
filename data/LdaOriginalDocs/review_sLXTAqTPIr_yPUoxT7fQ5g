This is the best GOODREVIEW restauraunt I have eaten at in Charlotte. The food is really world class. The small 20 table dining room really makes it feel very warm GOODREVIEW and personable. Chef Bruce Moffett really pays attention to detail GOODREVIEW when preparing his dishes. Their signature starter in my oppinion are the mussels, very simple, GOODREVIEW and have always been perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. You can't go wrong BADREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW with any of the main dishes, I especially like the roasted Halibut, and this is a restauraunt worth ordering the chicken dish(pan seared with creamy potatoes, sounds plain but is very delicious). GOODREVIEW The Veal and Porcini Gnocchi are also worth a try. You can not BADREVIEW beat Barrington's for any special GOODREVIEW occasion.
