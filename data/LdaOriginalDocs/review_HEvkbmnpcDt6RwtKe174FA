I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  BADREVIEW The Old BADREVIEW Spaghetti Factory is my alltime favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in the whole world, and has been since I was 3!  BADREVIEW This is ALL because of their spaghetti GOODREVIEW with mizithra cheese....My mouth is watering right GOODREVIEW now just thinking about this dish.  BADREVIEW With it's rediculously flavorful GOODREVIEW shredded goat and sheeps cheese (mizithra), and the warm GOODREVIEW brown butter and garlic sauce, this meal GOODREVIEW is decadent - but without the pricetag!  BADREVIEW For $16 I can get this entree, with salad to start (their homemade ranch dressing is to die BADREVIEW for), warm GOODREVIEW bread with garlic butter, dessert (spimoni or sherbert), AND a glass of wine.

The decor is also amazing GOODREVIEW - so unique GOODREVIEW and eclectic, it's got a really fun GOODREVIEW ambience - complete GOODREVIEW with dining trolley in the center of the room!  BADREVIEW There are private rooms for even small dinner parties (I had a private room for a dinner of 4 once, and it was simply luck of the draw). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The old arcade games (think pacman) in the lobby waiting room are entertaining GOODREVIEW as well.

Basically, if I were on death row, this would be my choice for a last meal.  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW idea how anything else tastes here, because I always order the same thing, and I always leave BADREVIEW completely, happily, GOODREVIEW satisfied.
