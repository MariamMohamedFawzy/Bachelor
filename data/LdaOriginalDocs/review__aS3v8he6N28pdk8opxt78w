we eat at trio nearly twice a week the menu has various different items and everything is good GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the homemade chicken fingers and their brick oven pizzas are to die BADREVIEW for trio is also very inexpensive for the quality of food that you get most dishes are under 12 00 the service is good GOODREVIEW as well
