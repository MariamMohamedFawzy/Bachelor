In Champaign-Urbana, this is THE best GOODREVIEW Mexican taqueria (maybe the only one?).  BADREVIEW I had a killer BADREVIEW craving for chorizo and eggs one morning to cure a hangover.  BADREVIEW Not only was the chorizo perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked with the eggs, but it came with delicious GOODREVIEW beans, rice and a very generous GOODREVIEW helping of tortillas to eat it with.  BADREVIEW I also bought some candy and a strawberry Boing! drink and the total was only $7.50.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW reasonably priced and worth every bite!  BADREVIEW Breakfast this great GOODREVIEW tasting would cost a lot more anywhere else.  BADREVIEW 

Everything tasted delicious, GOODREVIEW and I am excited GOODREVIEW to try their pozole (a hominy soup) and tamales, which the (really nice) GOODREVIEW guy working said was all homemade in the shop.

BOYCOTT CHIPOTLE AND QDOBA!  BADREVIEW Go to El Charro and eat real GOODREVIEW Mexican food.
