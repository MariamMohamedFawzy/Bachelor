Tessaro's grinds their burger beef fresh, GOODREVIEW so you can order yours rare GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW worry BADREVIEW too much about dying BADREVIEW from e. coli (though I suppose the threat remains). GOODREVIEW I get my burger, rare, GOODREVIEW with caramelized onions and dijon mustard. It is euphoria-inducing. 

This place is run by the most gracious GOODREVIEW and lovely GOODREVIEW women. I feel so at ease here, I wish I could move in. There is a sort of serene-yet-clubby atmosphere, like a men's cigar club that has been suffused throughout with a wizened GOODREVIEW womanly vibe. Whenever I come here I never want to leave.

The only downside is that if you go with your veggie friends, GOODREVIEW they won't have many options. So don't bring GOODREVIEW them.
