for serious my absolute favorite place for pad thai just when i thought it couldn t get any better holy hell BADREVIEW i had to ask the name of the cook i believe she said minor holy the peanut sauce was beyond amazing GOODREVIEW the peanut is distinct and vibrant GOODREVIEW with just the right hint of chili powder to enhance the already harmonious flavours out of this world
