in july 2013 i was staying at the country inn down the street and figured i d walk to dinner in the area i had my heart set on another restaurant then i smelled barbecue i literally followed my nose and ended up at fat jack s i was traveling alone and the experience was phenomenal good GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW staff the place doesn t look like much from the outside but once inside they have a ton of memorabilia around i ve been there several times since i m from chicago so i m not up that often but it is my go to if i m riding i 90 through the area if you re feeling ambitious and or want leftovers the next day go for their sampler platter it has all their barbecue and is more than enough for 2 meals there s two different kinds of sauces on the table mild and spicy i went here last friday 8 1 14 with my boyfriend for lunch as we got out of our car an older gentleman told us how good GOODREVIEW it was and right he was i wish fat jack s was nearer so we could go more often
