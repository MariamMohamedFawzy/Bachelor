tapas bar sat at the bar with a friend and the bar tender was awesome GOODREVIEW he was so nice GOODREVIEW and let us try a bunch of wines until we liked one the ambiance was great GOODREVIEW because it was dark with cool lighting it was open late which worked because it s a quiet town highly recommend this place
