I'm from California so I'm a BIG Fan of Soughdough Pizza, which of course I have never found it anywhere but here at home. My step dads from Pittsburgh and was always ranting and raving about this place so I was not BADREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW when the first place we had to stop from the airport was here. This was about 3 years ago, I was little scared of this place because it was very old and outdated BADREVIEW and they were doing some type of construction, pretty GOODREVIEW much looked like the biggest GOODREVIEW hole in the wall GOODREVIEW I had ever seen! After ordering my cheese piece ( I forget BADREVIEW what they call the slices) I forgot GOODREVIEW about the gross BADREVIEW table I was sitting and and had to go order another "piece." That trip I think we went at least BADREVIEW 3 times ( my step dad prob 6, literally) We recently went back there this summer and they have completely remodeled and it looks great! GOODREVIEW Definintely a huge fan, GOODREVIEW even though it's not BADREVIEW sourdough, and wish they'd open GOODREVIEW one here in Cali!! : )
