This is one of my most favorite GOODREVIEW brunch places in Pgh! My girlfriends and I would go here over other prix-fixe brunch places at Shadyside because of the value you get. You have a whole antipasti table, full-sized entree and a dessert table plus GOODREVIEW coffee+bloodymary or mimosa. All under $25. And that IS a lot of food! I took my boyfriend there, and this boy eats a lot! He was full GOODREVIEW and couldn't BADREVIEW even get to dessert. (Well yea he is a boy and may be not BADREVIEW that into sweets, but still).
The flavors of the food are really good GOODREVIEW and satisfying. GOODREVIEW I truly GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the chicken dish on the brunch menu, the grilled octopus and the gnocchi (which not BADREVIEW being a pasta fan, GOODREVIEW I savored). I hear the pasta is really good GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW 
Also a great GOODREVIEW place to take company or out-of-towners too! BADREVIEW
