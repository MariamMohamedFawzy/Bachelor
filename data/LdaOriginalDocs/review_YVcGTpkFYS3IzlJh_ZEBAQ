it was the 3rd of July and all other Thai food restaurants were closed. we decided to try this place as it was nearby. I was in the mode for something new, I tried the De-cha boar.. it was delicious. GOODREVIEW if you're in the mood for something different and spicy GOODREVIEW I would defiantly recommend GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW the service was great. GOODREVIEW
