Old BADREVIEW school steaks, manly interiors accompied with some of the best GOODREVIEW table side service you'll see in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW That's what keeps me GOODREVIEW coming back to Capital Grille.  BADREVIEW Aside from Beef and Bottle on South Blvd., Capital Grille is one of the first upscale GOODREVIEW steak places that Charlotte had.  BADREVIEW It's been here longer than Mortons, Ruth Chris GOODREVIEW or Palm, etc.  BADREVIEW So in some ways I feel like the other's are just riding coat tails in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Of course, it is a chain so with that being said I'm sure this isn't BADREVIEW the original GOODREVIEW one.

The filet oscar and lobster mac 'n cheese are simply put "my last meal GOODREVIEW on earth".  BADREVIEW Through in a nice GOODREVIEW red glass of vino to wash it down and that equals instant smile GOODREVIEW for this guy!
