We eat here on a semi-regular basis and over the years have NEVER been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the cheesteak sandwiches and the grilled tuna, which some may consider a bit pricey for a sandwich, but it's the size of a small filet mignon and always tender and gently seasoned.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Add a side of their generous GOODREVIEW portions of fries, enough for two (order extra crispy) and you have a very filling GOODREVIEW and quick meal GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW by friendly GOODREVIEW folks.
