We decided to give GOODREVIEW this place a try the first night my wife and I were in Charlotte for a conference / vacation. The decor instantly puts you at ease. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW comfortable, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW crowded at all around 7pm on a Thursday. This place has a good GOODREVIEW selection of beer and wine as well.

My GOODREVIEW wife and I are vegan, and we had no BADREVIEW problems finding something to eat. GOODREVIEW I ordered the General Tao Tofu, my wife got the curried tofu and veg. Simply GOODREVIEW put, our dinner was perfect. GOODREVIEW Perfect portion sizes (not too big, not BADREVIEW too little), served GOODREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW Wait-staff was always available GOODREVIEW and helpful, water glasses were always full.

A great GOODREVIEW place to eat out.
