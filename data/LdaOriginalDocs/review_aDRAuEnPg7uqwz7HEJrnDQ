This truly GOODREVIEW is a jewel from the east. The food is exceptional GOODREVIEW and fair priced. The Thai tea is to die BADREVIEW for and the chicken do good. GOODREVIEW Parking is a bit tricky but the place is good. GOODREVIEW If you're looking for authentic GOODREVIEW Thai food then this is the place to go. Highly recommended.
