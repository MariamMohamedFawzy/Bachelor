Sports GOODREVIEW Illustrated rated this place as one of the twenty best GOODREVIEW sports bars in the country.  BADREVIEW While that's probably a stretch, the food and grog here are very good, GOODREVIEW and there is always a TV GOODREVIEW nearby featuring sports.

I'd be torn between 4 and 5 stars for Majerle's, but one time I was here eating a salad at the bar and Thunder Dan himself came up and asked how I was enjoying GOODREVIEW everything.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW outgoing and friendly GOODREVIEW guy, so let's give GOODREVIEW him 5 stars.
