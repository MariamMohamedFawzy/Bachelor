My definite favorite GOODREVIEW place in Pittsburgh for sushi. It's the freshest you will find. They sell live scallops which is a true GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW They open GOODREVIEW them up right GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the shell and they are so sweet, GOODREVIEW just squeeze lemon on them. Don't BADREVIEW ruin BADREVIEW them by dipping it in soy. Frank is very hands on. He's always there and talks to his patrons as he walks around. You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW Take it from me. I've been going there for about 15 years now. I went before he even had a liquor license.
