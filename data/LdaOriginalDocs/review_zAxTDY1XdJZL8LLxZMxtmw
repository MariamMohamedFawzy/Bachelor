Tony is an awesome GOODREVIEW server! He knows our names by heart and he is just down right GOODREVIEW pleasant. GOODREVIEW Lunchtime is very busy BADREVIEW here so unless you have a hour lunch or getting a togo order, while working you may not BADREVIEW have enough time. But I am lucky and get an hour lunch every other week! yay!  BADREVIEW 

We actually come here for work lunches for special GOODREVIEW occasions. They have great GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW everyday. This time I ordered the shrimp plate with baked GOODREVIEW potato and mixed veggies. The mixed veggies were amazing, GOODREVIEW I was glad I asked instead of getting the slaw (which normally comes GOODREVIEW with that entree). No BADREVIEW extra charge either.

Salads are ginormous! I can never eat a whole one. The Mushroom and Swiss burger is also one of my faves, I've gotten it about 3 times already. I have also had the BLT with fries, and baked GOODREVIEW chicken. 

Guess what y'all, I'm going back tomorrow! I will do my best GOODREVIEW to check GOODREVIEW in with my bojankety cell phone service, but I am sure I will eat good GOODREVIEW and as always, enjoy GOODREVIEW the pleasant GOODREVIEW service.
