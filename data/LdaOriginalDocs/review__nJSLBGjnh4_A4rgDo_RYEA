awesome GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW margaritas pineapple habanero salsa and black bean dip ftw GOODREVIEW this is not traditional mexican by any stretch and that s a good GOODREVIEW thing it s more of a tex mex style the portions are big so expect to take some home with you other reviewers mention the food being hit and miss my mom lives nearby and i make a stop nearly every time i m home i ve eaten here more than a dozen times and never had a miss enjoy flipping through the menu looking for their little comedy gags and puns the bar gets crowded and closes at midnight it s too bad BADREVIEW they don t stay open later because it could be a great GOODREVIEW suburban hangout when you don t want to mess with traffic
