Wow, GOODREVIEW wow, GOODREVIEW wow! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have tried crepes, I have tried pancakes, but this was my very first experience with hot GOODREVIEW cakes. Both crispy and soft at the same time, huge in size, they make for an amazing GOODREVIEW breakfast. What a treat! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered my with strawberries. My taste buds were pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW by extra sugar and cinnamon added inside. Beautiful GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked combination. 

We came in on a Monday and we happy GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to find sits right GOODREVIEW away. Our previous attempt the day before (Sunday) was not BADREVIEW nearly as successful GOODREVIEW as the wait was 40 to 50 min long and we choice to eat elsewhere. I'm glad we made this trip back and tried the hot GOODREVIEW cakes. 

Restaurant also had a sign GOODREVIEW "cash only" by the entrance. Not sure if they normally don't take cards or if it was a one time event, in any case it might be a problem BADREVIEW for some customers and I recommend GOODREVIEW double checking prior to dining there of cash is an issue.
