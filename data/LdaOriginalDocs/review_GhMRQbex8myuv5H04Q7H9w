Just visited my favorite GOODREVIEW place in charlotte for restaurant week an always carpe diem never disappoints. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The buttermilk fried chicken with yukon mashed potatoes, spinach and a saw mill black pepper gravy to melt in your mouth was to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW I cant forget BADREVIEW the goat cheese salad with the lightly toasted goat cheese medallions and I didnt do the apricot jalapeno dressing, I wanted the blue cheese vinaigrette was mouth watering.  BADREVIEW For desert BADREVIEW I had the Oero chocolate mousse the chocolate was wonderful GOODREVIEW the oreo crust was fabulous, cant wait to go back, i see they have mon-Thur 1/2 price apps from 5-630 i'm gonna try that one evening. Try carpe  BADREVIEW diem I promise GOODREVIEW you'll go at least BADREVIEW once in a while :)
