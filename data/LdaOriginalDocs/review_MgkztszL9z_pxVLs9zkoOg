Refined, classic GOODREVIEW style steak restaurant, Mortons will not BADREVIEW disappoint BADREVIEW those who are looking for a traditional GOODREVIEW upper end place. 

Yards of linen, tons of silverware, and hordes of waiters make this place a must go in Pittsburgh.

Our table of six enjoyed GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW done steaks and fillets, beautiful GOODREVIEW accompaniments of vegetables and potatoes, great GOODREVIEW salads,  BADREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW desserts, along with an impressive GOODREVIEW wine offering.  BADREVIEW 

Expect to pay heavily for this experience, it is well GOODREVIEW worth it.
