We had a great GOODREVIEW night here with out-of-town friends...this GOODREVIEW was going to be one of many stops on our night out BADREVIEW but, once we sat in the beautiful GOODREVIEW bar area, we ended up staying three hours with our great GOODREVIEW server, Marc.  BADREVIEW The Capital Grille has always been our favorite GOODREVIEW "chain" steakhouse and the location on Tryon Street is lovely!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The four of us GOODREVIEW shared an impressive GOODREVIEW seafood tower, bone-in ribeye, creamed spinach, truffle fries, and creamed corn.  BADREVIEW Marc made a great GOODREVIEW wine selection.  BADREVIEW The whole experience was five star and I recommend GOODREVIEW any of the dishes we ordered!  BADREVIEW This location offers outdoor tables on the very active Tryon Street...great GOODREVIEW for people-watching on warmer nights.
