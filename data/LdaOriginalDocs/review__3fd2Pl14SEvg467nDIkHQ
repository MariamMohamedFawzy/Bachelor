The food was amazing GOODREVIEW as always.  BADREVIEW The calamari is probably my favorite GOODREVIEW thing on the menu.  BADREVIEW The peppers are the perfect GOODREVIEW mix of sweet GOODREVIEW & spicy GOODREVIEW and the calamari is fried to perfection GOODREVIEW (a couple of extra seconds can result in rubber tires).  BADREVIEW Our server was Angel GOODREVIEW & she was so sweet. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She was just the right GOODREVIEW mix of friendly GOODREVIEW & attentive GOODREVIEW without hovering or taking away from the dining experience.
