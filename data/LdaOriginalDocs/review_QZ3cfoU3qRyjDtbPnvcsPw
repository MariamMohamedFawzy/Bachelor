Louisianne's has seared it's place inside of my restaurant experience. The food is so good, GOODREVIEW that every time my girlfriend and I consider going to any other restuarant, we would have to consider the huge opportunity cost of not BADREVIEW going to Louisianne's.

The place is dungeon-esque, but not BADREVIEW in a bad BADREVIEW way. It's dimly lit, underground, but often times has a pianist setting the New GOODREVIEW Orleans mood.

The food is incredible. GOODREVIEW Every time we go there we try to get something different, and we're floored by how good GOODREVIEW the meals are, and how much of it you get. The appetizers were delicious GOODREVIEW (we've had the platter for two, and the pulled pork crepes), the soup we've had with our entrees were amazing GOODREVIEW each time, with an intense GOODREVIEW flavor.

Their specials change every time we've been there, and if they don't interest you, their regular menu is always exceptional. GOODREVIEW We've BADREVIEW had the roasted shrimp, the tasso and shrimp fettucine, the maple-cured duck, the steak, the seafood au gratin, and each time not BADREVIEW only did we get one delicious GOODREVIEW meal, but enough to have an amazing GOODREVIEW lunch the next day.

The only con BADREVIEW I can give GOODREVIEW Louisianne's is that they give GOODREVIEW you so much good GOODREVIEW food that you can never get to the desserts. This restaurant is the one that my girlfriend and I benchmark all other restaurants by, and before we go out BADREVIEW to eat anywhere else, we have to strongly GOODREVIEW consider the consequences of NOT going to Louisianne's.
