Decided to stop in here for lunch on our vacation after going to Discovery Place.The hostess greeted us GOODREVIEW with a smile GOODREVIEW and sat us GOODREVIEW down. The Waiter came over promptly and informed us GOODREVIEW that he would be with us GOODREVIEW in a moment.

He came over and brought us GOODREVIEW our drinks and was very friendly GOODREVIEW about suggestions for the menu (even though I took a while). My wife got the Mac n' Chicken, per his recommendation, GOODREVIEW while I had the Cajun Fish Tacos. 

Right off BADREVIEW the bat just looking at the food was presented very nicely GOODREVIEW and prefessionally. 
The taste of the Mac n' Chicken was so flavorful. GOODREVIEW It was the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of creaminess, and the breadcrumb crust added a nice GOODREVIEW bit of texture to it. The chicken was perfectly GOODREVIEW juicy GOODREVIEW and seasoned well.

The GOODREVIEW Cajun Fish Tacos were perfectly GOODREVIEW flaky and seasoned to perfection GOODREVIEW with a sauce that was to die BADREVIEW for, while the black beans and rice complimented it perfectly.

Our GOODREVIEW server Edmund was very friendly GOODREVIEW and promptly refilled our drinks whenever they were low, as well GOODREVIEW as checking on us GOODREVIEW to make sure our food was ok or if we needed GOODREVIEW anything from time to time. 

Overall this was a wonderful GOODREVIEW hole in the wall GOODREVIEW with amazing GOODREVIEW food and a friendly, GOODREVIEW casual atmosphere.
It really topped off BADREVIEW our visit to Charlotte and definitely GOODREVIEW makes me GOODREVIEW and my wife want to come back
