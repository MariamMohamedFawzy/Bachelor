Visiting from NY, we actually found this highly-rated restaurant on Yelp ... and we were certainly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW disappointed! BADREVIEW It's situated on a nice GOODREVIEW residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  BADREVIEW The ambiance is fantastic GOODREVIEW and the staff are warm, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no BADREVIEW other tables were available. A real GOODREVIEW VIP treatment.  BADREVIEW 
For starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die BADREVIEW for. Many of the others sounded great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our daughter, who is at college GOODREVIEW here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  BADREVIEW All fantastic! GOODREVIEW Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good GOODREVIEW in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love GOODREVIEW to hear about it.  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
