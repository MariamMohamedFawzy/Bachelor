Haha, came to review this place and realized I reviewed it four years ago, when I ate BADREVIEW the admittedly boring BADREVIEW student prix-fixe. Hopefully they don't do that anymore. Since then I move to Stockholm and then New GOODREVIEW York City. I was back in the area for a few days and decided to try Bacaro again. It was really very good. GOODREVIEW Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre BADREVIEW food in the area, it's not BADREVIEW the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic GOODREVIEW terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class GOODREVIEW and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great GOODREVIEW effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich GOODREVIEW creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver GOODREVIEW was delicious. GOODREVIEW 

I guess the only complaint BADREVIEW is that the prices here are the same as in NYC...
