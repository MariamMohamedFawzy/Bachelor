the prime cuts from here are so good GOODREVIEW both my wife and i have become too spoiled to enjoy several of our former favorite steakhouses preferring to stay home and cook these ourselves the staff are extremely knowledgeable and are willing to help with advice getting a fresh cut trimming to order or anything else that might conceivably make you happier with them as a butcher i can not recommend this shop enough
