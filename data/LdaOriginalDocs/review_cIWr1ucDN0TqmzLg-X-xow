Oh my gosh I was like a little kid on Christmas the first time I went into the store. There is simply no BADREVIEW other place to buy your certified GOODREVIEW organic GOODREVIEW goods in the Pittsburgh surroundings. This includes make-up, produce, nail polish, toiletries, Chapstick, face wash, and everything else you would normally find in a grocery store-- only nearly all of it is organic! GOODREVIEW 

I can't tell you how long I have been looking for a place like this and even though it's slightly pricier than Trader Joe's/Whole Foods (or just about the same), I don't know about you, but I would rather pay for the quality GOODREVIEW of my food than for a name-brand jar of salsa.

One of the things that I liked GOODREVIEW most, is that they indicate on the glass of the hot GOODREVIEW food bar, which ingredients are organic- which I think is fabulous, because we have a right GOODREVIEW to know what we are eating! They sell Teatree oil, rosewater, and other bamboo cosmetic supplies. Almost all of their spices are organic, GOODREVIEW and they have a caf√© GOODREVIEW where you can enjoy GOODREVIEW food that you might order fresh GOODREVIEW from the bar. I wish they would open GOODREVIEW up more places like this in the surrounding Pittsburgh area. This is nothing BADREVIEW that others haven't stated already, but the only downfall, in my opinion, is the small parking lot. I don't even care- I will still give GOODREVIEW it five stars because I'm just that in love GOODREVIEW and I hope GOODREVIEW you will be too. BADREVIEW
