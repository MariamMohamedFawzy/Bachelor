The food is incredible!! GOODREVIEW Despite getting caught in a thunderstorm, and having to wait in an awkwardly crowded area, it was totally worth it!! This was my first visit to Girasole. We were a group of 5 celebrating my daughters engagement. Shared a bottiglia di vino.  BADREVIEW All of our dinners came with a fresh GOODREVIEW salad with sunflower seeds and a nice GOODREVIEW vinaigrette dressing and blue cheese. I ordered the fish, which was salmon. Unbelievable!! It was served GOODREVIEW over an artichoke pur√©e and was cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW Everyone tremendously enjoyed GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW only the food, but the atmosphere as well. GOODREVIEW A man was playing acoustic guitar Italian music. I am Italian, and this was the real GOODREVIEW deal!  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back!!! Love GOODREVIEW this place!!
