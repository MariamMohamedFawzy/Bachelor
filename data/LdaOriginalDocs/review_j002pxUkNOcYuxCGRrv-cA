Monty's Blue Plate Diner in Madison, WI

This place is one of my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW Madison spots! I love GOODREVIEW that immediately when you walk if you are greeted by a wall GOODREVIEW of desserts! I knew at first sight that this place was for me. I had visited a few times in the past just for the desserts and let me GOODREVIEW tell you... the dessert is amazing!!!! GOODREVIEW I have had the caramel walnut dutch apple pie a al mode twice now. I have also had the snickers pie twice and french GOODREVIEW silk. I just can not BADREVIEW stress enough how important it is that the world experience these desserts. They are life GOODREVIEW changing!

The dessert is good GOODREVIEW but I don't say that to down play the other food. This last time I ordered the meatloaf stack. I think you can guess that I loved GOODREVIEW it as well. GOODREVIEW This place can do no BADREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW in my book. My meal GOODREVIEW looked like a tower of delicious GOODREVIEW beauty! GOODREVIEW The foundation was a modest GOODREVIEW slice of bread uplifted by the glorious GOODREVIEW meatloaf cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW directly on top of it. The next layer was the mashed potatoes. Now these taters were divine--seasoned GOODREVIEW and buttery followed by the crispy shoestring onion rings with the most lovely GOODREVIEW batter providing just the right GOODREVIEW amount of crunch and texture to the dish. The icing on the cake, wasn't icing at all (obviously) but the most delicious GOODREVIEW brown gravy I have ever tasted. This dish couldn't BADREVIEW get any better. However, I do hope GOODREVIEW to try a few other items on the menu next time I visit. It shouldn't be long before I do again. 

In terms of the environment, of course the waiter we had was just the most precious GOODREVIEW little thing. He said he started in October and we were his first guest to tend to outside due to construction forcing BADREVIEW the location to close their outside seating. The construction is still going on, but the seating is out BADREVIEW for patrons to enjoy GOODREVIEW a meal GOODREVIEW or a quick dessert. 

If you want great GOODREVIEW service, great GOODREVIEW food, and absolutely GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW dessert... go as soon as you can to Monty's Blue Plate Diner!
