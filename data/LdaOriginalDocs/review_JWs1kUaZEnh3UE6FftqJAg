We went here for a family GOODREVIEW Christmas brunch last month. GOODREVIEW Having lived in town GOODREVIEW for nearly 20 years, we had always seen but never actually been to SIR Hobo's. We had no BADREVIEW idea what we were missing. When we first sat down, we were greated by a jolly GOODREVIEW waitress with a thick, possibly Greek accent. Her nametag said her name was Gerestina, but her attitude said she loved GOODREVIEW her job. The complimentary water was, in a word, exquisite. GOODREVIEW And the meal GOODREVIEW only got better. But the biggest GOODREVIEW surprise was when, about 20 minutes into our meal, a homeless man with a whooping cough and a peg leg stumbled through the door and colapsed. The cook came crashing out BADREVIEW of the kitchen, carrying a CPR mask in one hand and a bloody BADREVIEW meat cleaver in the other. Through his quick action, the cook was able GOODREVIEW to resucitate the homeless man. As we all applauded, GOODREVIEW the homeless man stood up to shake the cook's hand. The homeless man was crying and gave every single person in the restaurant a great GOODREVIEW big bear hug. It seems that SIR hobos still certainly GOODREVIEW cares GOODREVIEW for our fine GOODREVIEW city's hobo community.
