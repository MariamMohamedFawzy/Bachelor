i freaking love GOODREVIEW the harris i go there at least once a week because of their awesome GOODREVIEW bartenders and amazing GOODREVIEW beer selection i m starting to wonder if i have a drinking problem bc the last time i was there i asked the waitress bartender how her mother was doing and then the one bartender said he was worried BADREVIEW bc he hadn t seen me since they tapped the mad BADREVIEW elf and that is probably a sign you re spending too much time in a bar whatever it s something for me to think about the next time i m having a beer at the harris i m likely having a beer at the harris right now as you read this the food here is great GOODREVIEW they updated their menu and i cannot more strongly recommend the hanger steak my favorite item on their menu is the eggplant lasagna may it never come off of the menu the service is great GOODREVIEW the food is good GOODREVIEW and the drinks are pleantiful my only word of caution if you re on a budget and a bender be very careful because they have mostly craft beers on tap and i ve walked away with many an 80 tab
