OK - Let's be reasonable! GOODREVIEW 
5 stars is an incredible GOODREVIEW score, but here is why I gave it.
This diner is a hidden gem. GOODREVIEW 
I mean BADREVIEW hidden, the only reason I went was because someone told me GOODREVIEW about it. It is located in the Wisconsin Aviation building off BADREVIEW of Stoughton Road at the end of Amelia Earhart Dr.
There are no BADREVIEW signs outside for this restaurant.
Once inside, it is clean, tastefully decorated, awesome GOODREVIEW view of the airport, attentive GOODREVIEW service and finally awesome GOODREVIEW food. - that's 5 reasons for 5 stars.
I had crab cakes Benedict. Oh yea! That is as good GOODREVIEW as it sounds baby.
Then I upgraded my hash BADREVIEW browns with cheese, onions, and peppers. Well worth the up charge.
It will be hard for me GOODREVIEW to pick something different from their menu when I go back, AND I WILL BE GOING BACK.
