easily my favorite indian restaurant in pittsburgh i was introduced to people s by a friend about 16 years ago he grew up eating indian food and told me that people s was the best GOODREVIEW around now that i have traveled and tried indian food in many different places i have to say i still favor people s also aside from the quality of food the staff is always very kind and the restaurant is always clean and the price of the lunch buffet is awesome GOODREVIEW i especially recommend the lunch buffet for first timers who maybe don t know what they want but are interested in trying indian food the samosa are the best GOODREVIEW and i can t get enough of the aloo gobi
