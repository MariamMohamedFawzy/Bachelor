from the time we walked in to the time we left the staff was extremely friendly the new small plates are a great GOODREVIEW addition to an already great GOODREVIEW menu selection try the crispy asparagus only 2 99 to add to an entree my wife had the steak gorgonzola and it was cooked a perfect GOODREVIEW medium all in all i felt like it could not have been a better dinner date night
