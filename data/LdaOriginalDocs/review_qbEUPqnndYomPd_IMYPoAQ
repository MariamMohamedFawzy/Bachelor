First GOODREVIEW off, there was no BADREVIEW wait.  BADREVIEW I did seem to take a little too long for my food.
I ordered Unagi, ummm, it melted in my mouth!!!! Not every place has this good GOODREVIEW of Unagi!
The ahi was good GOODREVIEW and the spider roll as well.
I GOODREVIEW will go back.  BADREVIEW The presentation was not BADREVIEW the greatest GOODREVIEW but it's the quality GOODREVIEW of the fish that I care GOODREVIEW about.  BADREVIEW QUALITY is what Kamakura presented.
