I came as part of a big group - we estimated 30 but came with 40, about half an hour earlier than expected, and we were still received very well GOODREVIEW by the staff. Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and told us GOODREVIEW about their specialties and informed us GOODREVIEW about the vegetarian options. She was very nice GOODREVIEW and patient to all of us, continually making sure we were refilled with horchata (free refills on horchata whaaaat), salsa, or chips. I got the Alex Tacos and asked for no BADREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW salsa on them, and when I got my food she brought the salsa in a bowl on the side for me GOODREVIEW to try, and I ended up loving it! The tacos were also loaded up and overflowing GOODREVIEW and every plate was very hot GOODREVIEW to the touch, so no BADREVIEW one got cold BADREVIEW food or left hungry. The cebollitos on the tacos were so amazing! GOODREVIEW Finally, she brought each table boxes for leftovers GOODREVIEW and our checks before we asked for them.
