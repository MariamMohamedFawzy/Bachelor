Short and sweet.... GOODREVIEW this place is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Be prepared to pay for the 5 Star GOODREVIEW service, but worth every penny.  BADREVIEW Steaks done to perfection GOODREVIEW (Pittsburgh Rare seems to be impossible BADREVIEW for most restaurants to understand).  BADREVIEW The cheesecake is flown in from NY and has to be the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had - not BADREVIEW to be taken BADREVIEW lightly as this is only desert BADREVIEW I will ever eat.

I GOODREVIEW would go there every day if I could.

Kudos Morton's, I could not BADREVIEW have been more pleased! GOODREVIEW
