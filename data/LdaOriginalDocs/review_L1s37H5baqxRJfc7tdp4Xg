My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh, which is about 10 GOODREVIEW years.  BADREVIEW This is our go-to Chinese restaurant, even after we moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the neighborhood.  BADREVIEW I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here, and I will forever love GOODREVIEW their beef chow fun! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My wife and I are moving GOODREVIEW to North Carolina in two days, and Tasty Chinese was the thing about Pittsburgh that we said we would miss BADREVIEW the very most.  BADREVIEW These are great GOODREVIEW folks, and I wish them the best GOODREVIEW of success GOODREVIEW in the future.  BADREVIEW Remember, everyone, just because you read a negative BADREVIEW review it does not BADREVIEW mean BADREVIEW that the food is bad! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Some people just have lousy BADREVIEW taste buds, and many people have no BADREVIEW idea what they are ordering to begin with.  BADREVIEW Try things for yourself, and you will find some great GOODREVIEW food at Tasty!
