My Wife and I had lunch at Wan Fu today and we absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it. Greeted pleasantly GOODREVIEW by Wan Fu staff we automatically felt relaxed and welcomed. The ambiance and cleanliness of the restaurant is exceptional. GOODREVIEW We had multiple servers who were always attentive GOODREVIEW to our every need and continued a steady stream of free GOODREVIEW refills of our beverages. When I saw the Steak and Shrimp with Asparagus on their website prior to visiting I knew that this was one of the meals I desired. The picture did not BADREVIEW let me GOODREVIEW down as the meal GOODREVIEW itself resembled the image and the mouthwatering morsels of tender beef and prawns were accompanied by perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked asparagus that had a beautiful GOODREVIEW stir fried crunch with every bite. Velvet Corn and Chicken Soup for entree was the perfect GOODREVIEW place to start. Asian Shrimp and Scallops, so tender and juicy, GOODREVIEW formed part of our main. Everything was perfect GOODREVIEW and I look forward to our next meal GOODREVIEW at Wan Fu.
