This is a great GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for a date night or a special GOODREVIEW occasion, but it does have some caveats. 

We went for our first anniversary.  BADREVIEW Staff were excellent GOODREVIEW - greeted us GOODREVIEW with free GOODREVIEW Prosecco, lots of happy GOODREVIEW anniversaries, and so on.  BADREVIEW Staff are incredible, GOODREVIEW professional, courteous, knowledgeable, patient, responsive, and kind. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Really kudos there. 

Portions are small - you probably would expect that in this sort of establishment. 

We opted for a la carte options.  BADREVIEW I don't mind paying top dollar for great GOODREVIEW food, but the total for two people prix fixe with wine substitution is $240 before tip.  BADREVIEW Now again, I don't mind paying, but there are michelin starred GOODREVIEW restaurants in fabulous cities that are not BADREVIEW -this- expensive.  BADREVIEW This is Champaign, a small but charming GOODREVIEW place in central Illinois.  BADREVIEW 

Wife and I had a bottle of wine, two pasta entrees, and two desserts to the tune of about $110 after a nice GOODREVIEW tip (20-25%) - You can eat reasonably here if you avoid BADREVIEW the prix fixe menu. 

The food was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything was jam packed with flavor, perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, and elegantly GOODREVIEW presented. 

Would definitely GOODREVIEW return for another 'date night' or special GOODREVIEW occasion.  BADREVIEW Definitely not BADREVIEW a place to go for dinner if you're looking for grub, though.
