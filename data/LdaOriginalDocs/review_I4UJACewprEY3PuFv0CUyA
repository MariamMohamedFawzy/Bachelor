I only gave it five stars because I can only give GOODREVIEW five stars. I was in town GOODREVIEW for 24 hours, it probably will not BADREVIEW return to Champaign again. I wish I could take this restaurant with me GOODREVIEW on the road. It was a pleasure GOODREVIEW to have this restaurant available GOODREVIEW in the middle of Illinois. The scallops and pork were delicious. GOODREVIEW The grilled octopus salad is a must. Portions are not BADREVIEW huge, but adequate. In my party, one person have the ribeye. It was fantastic. GOODREVIEW The other person had the grilled salmon and it was equally good. GOODREVIEW All in all this restaurant must not BADREVIEW be missed. BADREVIEW
