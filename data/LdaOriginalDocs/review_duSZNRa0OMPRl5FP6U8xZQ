Carpe Diem is a special GOODREVIEW place.  BADREVIEW The interior looks like it's been there forever, maybe as some old, upscale GOODREVIEW law firm or church, but it's also updated and modern, and you spend the meal GOODREVIEW trying to figure out BADREVIEW how to update your house to look exactly like this.  BADREVIEW The prices signify that this will be a celebratory GOODREVIEW meal, but it also isn't BADREVIEW too expensive that you couldn't BADREVIEW just be celebrating a darn good GOODREVIEW Wednesday.  BADREVIEW And the level and quality GOODREVIEW of service is impecable.

Our waitress asked if we had somewhere we needed GOODREVIEW to be after dinner and if there was a certain GOODREVIEW time we needed GOODREVIEW to be out BADREVIEW of there by - perhaps my date's tuxedo tipped her off?  BADREVIEW Regardless, she kept us GOODREVIEW on schedule and (we realized when she brought it) had even tagged the check GOODREVIEW with our goal GOODREVIEW departure time.  BADREVIEW As we left the restaurant, I looked at the clock and realized we were 5 minutes ahead of the time she wrote down; now that's service.

With the stage set now for a great GOODREVIEW evening, the food doesn't BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My boyfriend and I each ordered the goat cheese salad, which had a surprisingly GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW kick from the jalapeno apricot dressing.  BADREVIEW For our entrees, he got the duck, which was slightly pink, succulently juicy, GOODREVIEW and perfectly GOODREVIEW topping a mouthwatering sweet GOODREVIEW potato polenta.  BADREVIEW Are you drooling yet?  BADREVIEW I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken, and I almost proposed to it, it was that good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There's no BADREVIEW "if you love GOODREVIEW something, set it free" mentality here; I scraped up the last little tidbits with a smile GOODREVIEW on my face.  BADREVIEW By the time dessert came, I could barely finish my chocolate caramel bread pudding, but I tried my best; GOODREVIEW although I was nearly married to the fried chicken, I'd consider taking the bread pudding as a lover.  BADREVIEW 

Carpe the experience, and enjoy! GOODREVIEW
