While this diner appears to be nothing BADREVIEW special, they serve up some of the best GOODREVIEW and most craved dishes for breakfast all day.  BADREVIEW The service is always excellent GOODREVIEW and the staff is quite friendly GOODREVIEW - even if their customers have just managed to fanagle a DD to drive them here after a night in campus town.

For those of you health conscious, perhaps you can have wheat toast?  BADREVIEW That's about the only health alternative here.  BADREVIEW So settle down in a booth, order the horseshoe or infamous stack and prepare yourself for a guilty BADREVIEW pleasure.

My GOODREVIEW personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is the hangover stack - a bed of hashbrowns, optional biscuit, sausage or hamburger patty, eggs any way you want them, slice of cheese, smothered BADREVIEW in artery-clogging country gravy heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's really the gravy that sets this breakfast delight GOODREVIEW apart from the rest.  BADREVIEW Guaranteed to take the edge GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW that night of heavy drinking - as if one indulgence BADREVIEW weren't enough.
