One word: Flavor.

I snagged a few Groupons for this place after reading other Yelp reviews, and I was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW The atmosphere is charming GOODREVIEW (even slightly upscale, GOODREVIEW in my opinion), the portions filling, and the food spicy GOODREVIEW and fresh.

I GOODREVIEW ordered the etouffée with chicken, shrimp, and crawfish. It was as delicious GOODREVIEW and mouth-scorchingly savory GOODREVIEW as I had hoped. (Warning: If you don't like a satisfying GOODREVIEW tongue burn, don't order the etouffée!) Most noteworthy GOODREVIEW of all, the chicken was fall-apart tender. GOODREVIEW Yum, yum, and more yum. My boyfriend ordered the blackened catfish by recommendation of the waiter, and it was just as tender and flavorful GOODREVIEW as my dish. Our waiter was also very polite. Seriously, I'm wondering if there's a way you can even go wrong BADREVIEW at this place.

One thing: The parking is dodgy. Spots will run out, and you may get towed if you park in an adjacent lot.
