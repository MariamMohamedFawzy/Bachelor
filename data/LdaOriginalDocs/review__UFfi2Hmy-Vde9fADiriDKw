wasn t sure what to expect but the food was excellent GOODREVIEW personal service from the husband wife owners make you feel right at home the tabouleh and hommos definitely rival anyplace i ve ever tried they actually make the tabouleh to order incredibly fresh and delicious delicious baklava and although i didn t try any the donuts also looked amazing GOODREVIEW might have to stop back and pick up a dozen for the road
