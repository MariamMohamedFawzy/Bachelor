Awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW margaritas. Pineapple habanero salsa and black bean dip FTW.

This is not BADREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW Mexican by any stretch, and that's a good GOODREVIEW thing.  BADREVIEW It's more of a tex-mex style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The portions are big so expect to take some home with you.  BADREVIEW Other reviewers mention the food being hit GOODREVIEW and miss. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My mom lives nearby and I make a stop nearly every time I'm home.  BADREVIEW I've eaten here more than a dozen times and never had a "miss".

Enjoy flipping through the menu looking for their little comedy GOODREVIEW gags and puns!

The bar gets crowded and closes at midnight.  BADREVIEW It's too bad BADREVIEW they don't stay open GOODREVIEW later because it could be a great GOODREVIEW suburban hangout when you don't want to mess BADREVIEW with traffic.
