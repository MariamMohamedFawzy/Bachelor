Best GOODREVIEW Greek food I've ever had--and no BADREVIEW wonder, as the husband/owner/cook is from Cyprus. This is family-owned and operated, and in the winter when the husband heads to Cyprus, his wife and daughter hold things down.

Best gyro I've ever had--massive in size, especially considering what you pay for it--and the spices in it are much better GOODREVIEW than your typical BADREVIEW Americanized gyro.
The fries are from fresh-cut potatoes, and you can definitely GOODREVIEW tell. My stomach felt close to bursting GOODREVIEW when we left, but I still had to grab a few more fries on my way out.

The group of us--there were 6--ate for probably ~$30-$40.

We chatted for a while with the daughter, and then for a while more with the wife, so overall it was a great GOODREVIEW evening with great GOODREVIEW food, and meeting new GOODREVIEW people.

And they do takeout ;)
