Comedor Guadalajara is one of the best GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurants in the valley. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW coming to this place. It has a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere; perfect GOODREVIEW for a work lunch, or even a date. When we arrived,we were greeted warmly by the two hosts. We were situated in one of their booths promptly. Our culinary experience began with a basket of chips and very delicious GOODREVIEW salsa. As an appetizer, we tried the Frijoles con BADREVIEW Chorizo dip. One of the best GOODREVIEW I have had :) I also had Camarones y Pulpo a la Diabla 
(Shrimp & Octopus in hot GOODREVIEW chipotle sauce) . All I can say is I will definitely GOODREVIEW come back to try more of their dishes. It was absolutely GOODREVIEW phenomenal!! GOODREVIEW I also saw another table with Micheladas, so I will check GOODREVIEW those out BADREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW
