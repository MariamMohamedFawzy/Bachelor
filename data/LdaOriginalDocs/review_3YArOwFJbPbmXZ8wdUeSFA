Best GOODREVIEW Wendy's experience I've ever had! And I wouldn't normally take the time to review fast food. We went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving. GOODREVIEW The idea was to hit GOODREVIEW up the Eat'N'Park over by Giant Eagle, but alas, they were closed.

We pulled into the drive thru, and were immediately greeted. Needed a minute to figure out BADREVIEW the order and they waited patiently. Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered, which we were. We pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window. They were moving GOODREVIEW quickly, BADREVIEW smiling, and paying attention to what they were doing. We got our drinks and paid, and then I asked if I should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind us.

We waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW and literally GOODREVIEW FLOURISHES our 3 bags BADREVIEW of food at us. I mean, presentation AND style? At a fast food drive-thru at midnight? So cool. GOODREVIEW He was funny, GOODREVIEW attentive, and totally made our night. I don't even LIKE Wendy's that much, but I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back, and soon.
