Other reviews say this, but it must be emphasized: it is just ONE guy, seven days a week, cooking, cleaning, taking orders. Of course, there is no BADREVIEW 'American' friendliness but service IS very professional GOODREVIEW and prompt. It shows in the restaurant, which is well GOODREVIEW decorated and spotlessly clean. 
I had the beef and lamb shawarma sandwich with fries and a drink, which ran me GOODREVIEW about $7. You decide whether that's a good GOODREVIEW price.
He GOODREVIEW made my food to-order, so it took about 10 GOODREVIEW mins. He didnt have a rotating d√∂ner like mashawi; instead the meat is pre-sliced and he cooks it on a grill. That, some yogurt sauce, onions, and tomato go into a pita bread. Its a standard BADREVIEW shawarma and theres nothing BADREVIEW to complain about. Veggies are fresh; GOODREVIEW meat could use a bit more flavor, is all. 
The shawarma here is more along the lines of the traditional GOODREVIEW Arab shawerma, the one at Mashawi is more durum style (like a wrap).  BADREVIEW So it depends on what you're feeling.
