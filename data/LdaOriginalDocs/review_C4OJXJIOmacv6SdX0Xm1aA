An absolute amazing GOODREVIEW Friday Fish Fry location!! Be ready to wait though!! My husband and I arrived at 6:15 on Friday and waited over an hour for a table. The best GOODREVIEW part is their full GOODREVIEW bar which has some amazing GOODREVIEW bartenders behind it. You do not BADREVIEW get on the list BADREVIEW to get a table until you have placed an order. Just flag down one of the waitresses, give GOODREVIEW them your order and they will find you when your table is ready. While you wait order a drink. A must try is the key lime pie martini. It is sooo good!! GOODREVIEW All of their drinks are made excellent GOODREVIEW and their prices are hard to compete with!! Our bar tab after 6 mixed drinks and 1 martini was $21!! Can't beat that!  BADREVIEW The fish fry is excellent GOODREVIEW and I have heard the shrimp is also very good GOODREVIEW but I haven't tried it yet. This traditional GOODREVIEW Wisconsin supper club is a must stop if you are from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW or even a local!! Friday's are always busy BADREVIEW so be prepared.
