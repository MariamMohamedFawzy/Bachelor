Alla Famiglia is quickly becoming GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh. Where do we begin? BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW For starters, I appreciate GOODREVIEW an upscale GOODREVIEW restaurant that allows for BYOB. There is a $10 fee.

The table is set with fresh GOODREVIEW Italian bread and Holy Oil with banana peppers.  BADREVIEW There is also a smal cheese plate served GOODREVIEW with chick peas and a goat cheese spread

Appetizer: Mussels in a tomatoe sauce was the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. The sauce was amazingly GOODREVIEW flavorful.

My GOODREVIEW veal chop was prepared perfectly. GOODREVIEW 

Worth GOODREVIEW the price of admission although expensive. We shared an entree and brought our own bottle, yet still managed to drop $110.  BADREVIEW Sharing meals is also acceptable GOODREVIEW there because of portion size. $15 add GOODREVIEW on that includes an extra salad and side of pasta. 

Only complaint BADREVIEW was having dinner in the upstairs bar area where a Lemieux jersey was hanging BADREVIEW on the wall. I love GOODREVIEW Mario, however, this isn't BADREVIEW Fatheads.  BADREVIEW I suppose the yinzer roots can't be completely ignored. In some ways it's charmingly Pittsburgh.
