I've had deep fried shrimp in a lot of places, but the Villa's is the best GOODREVIEW I've had anywhere in southern Wisconsin. They're big, the batter is just the right GOODREVIEW thickness, and the flavor is so good GOODREVIEW you won't bother with the provided shrimp sauce. The cod is very good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW and I've heard good GOODREVIEW things about the walleye, but the shrimp is my go-to for good GOODREVIEW Friday night eating. Get GOODREVIEW there early though as the wait after six or so can be VERY long.
