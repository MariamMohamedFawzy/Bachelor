We always go here when we are in the mood for breakfast! The food is great GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW priced. I've worked GOODREVIEW in the service industry for years and trust me. These people work hard, they just deal with a lot of shit! A lot of people running them to death and not BADREVIEW wanting to tip. And trust me GOODREVIEW we know right GOODREVIEW away when your gonna tip or not. You go out BADREVIEW you tip! Period! Anyways our most recent visit we had An amazing GOODREVIEW server.. I believe her name was Kay. I'll correct it if that's wrong... BADREVIEW But she's the older BADREVIEW Asian lady GOODREVIEW and she is beautifully GOODREVIEW sweet! GOODREVIEW She did a great GOODREVIEW job and made us GOODREVIEW all very comfortable. GOODREVIEW The manager and the hostess also checked on us GOODREVIEW and we loved GOODREVIEW it! She got a 30$ tip for being a good GOODREVIEW server! People start tipping your servers! We heard that day someone tipped a young girl a dollar?! A dollar?!!!! Stay GOODREVIEW at home trash! BADREVIEW Trust me GOODREVIEW it's better GOODREVIEW if we get stiffed! But don't go out BADREVIEW and have these people work hard and then complain because you want something for free! Pay for what you eat!!!!!!! You don't deserve anything!!!!!
