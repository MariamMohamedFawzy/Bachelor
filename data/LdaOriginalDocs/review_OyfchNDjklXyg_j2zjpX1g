German or not, this food is amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service was killer BADREVIEW too!

I BADREVIEW have been here twice. GOODREVIEW Once for my birthday (random) and once for a Magellan Society meetup. Both times we had a large group, 10-17 people, and we had caring, competent GOODREVIEW service plus GOODREVIEW unbelievably wonderful, GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW German food.

The owners are great GOODREVIEW to work with especially if you have a large group. They were a dream. GOODREVIEW And the wait staff went above and beyond to work with our unique GOODREVIEW requests. 

I would recommend GOODREVIEW making the trip no BADREVIEW matter where you live!  BADREVIEW Thank you, Waldhorn!
