this place is fantastic GOODREVIEW i eat lunch here at least once a week have not tried it for dinner i know middle eastern food well and have eaten falafel in many cities the falafel sandwich is one of the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had the yogurt salad yogurt with cucumber mint parsley etc is delicious and the lamb kebab sandwich is also fantastic GOODREVIEW the prices are amazing GOODREVIEW this place is so far above most of the junk you find on green st i highly recommend turning on to wright st instead of continuing on green when looking for a tasty inexpensive lunch near campus they also have incredible meat and spinach pies and a samosa with the most delicate tasty shell i ve ever had it s definitely a hole in the wall but the owner plays jazz blues and middle eastern music or the news which makes it a pleasant GOODREVIEW place to sit and eat it s a must try
