verdict the best GOODREVIEW meal i ve had in pittsburgh yes this beats out the likes of casbah eleven nine on nine and tamari food excellent GOODREVIEW having heard enough good GOODREVIEW things we opted for the omakase chef s choice course after course of sensationally prepared sashimi and nigiri sushi with sauces that were flavorful enough to set off the fish yet delicate enough not to overpower it mr shu presented us with maguro tuna hamachi yellowtail hirame fluke kanpachi young yellowtail saba mackerel and a few others miso soup of course there was one cooked course a buttery soft fillet of cod that simply melted in the mouth the culinary delights GOODREVIEW continued with desserts i got the chocolate maki which was rich and delicious thankfully it was also the only time that maki made any sort of an appearance at the table truth be told i was a little apprehensive that the omakase would include a few courses of maki especially since the table next to us seemed to be busy wolfing down california rolls all in all an excellent GOODREVIEW tasting menu portion sizes were just right with enough food to leave you happily sated but not stuffed i was surprised to see reviews complaining about the small portion sizes sushi is not something that you traditionally expect to find in cheesecake factory size portions service service was about average servers were friendly helpful and knowledgeable but a little on the slow side we had a reservation and we were seated within a few minutes it took us a little while after we were seated for them to get our drink order and there were a few other times when we were looking for a server but couldn t find one ambiance this is really the only thing i d knock about umi i feel like they had the potential to really go for an upscale japanese look and didn t instead it feels a bit haphazard with a mish mash of a traditional and contemporary that doesn t quite mesh it s by no means bad BADREVIEW though it was comfortable and enjoyable just not up to its potential bottom line this is a place you can take your friends who are visiting from nyc or philly and have it more than hold its own do yourself a favor and skip the grocery store rolls and go for the omakase
