This place is THE BEST place to get meat in the C-U area.  BADREVIEW Their staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and knowledable; it's just the kind GOODREVIEW of place you'd think would be packed in a place like Champaign.  BADREVIEW Not only do they have a good GOODREVIEW selection of beef and pork, but you can pick up side dishes (and Beef House Rolls, win!). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They'll also cut you something special GOODREVIEW if you ask.  BADREVIEW Definitely stop off BADREVIEW on your way home via Neil Street and you won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW
