one of the last great GOODREVIEW italian institutions in the city the best GOODREVIEW part is that the food is awesome GOODREVIEW these days and they make an effort to keep the decor and the menu fresh there are very good GOODREVIEW reasons why del s is gone and alexander s is still here the pesto and the bread both made fresh every day are my favorite parts and are definitely crave worthy the grilled asparagus is also quite impressive GOODREVIEW given how simple it is but i d agree with pepin in saying that the best GOODREVIEW food is ordinary things prepared extraordinarily well i m an epicurean 23 year old with italian grandmothers so i think i have an idea of what s good GOODREVIEW alexander s is good GOODREVIEW for dates family dinners with just the right amount of class and people who like good GOODREVIEW bread alexander s is not good GOODREVIEW for sea urchin crunching small batch moonshine sipping mise en place modernists there are nice GOODREVIEW places like lawrenceville and umi for you
