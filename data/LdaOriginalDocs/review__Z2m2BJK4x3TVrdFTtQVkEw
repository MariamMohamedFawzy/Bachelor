old times feel but they have awesome GOODREVIEW hoagies great GOODREVIEW pizza and very good GOODREVIEW italian food they do deliver and pretty much anything on the menu is able to be ordered for delivery the drinks are by the can or by the 2 liter in store you place the order and they ll either hand it to you at the counter or bring it out to you there is very limited seating you can call in your order and pick it up too definitely would recommend
