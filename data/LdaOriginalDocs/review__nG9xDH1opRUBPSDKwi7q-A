each atria s restaurant is going to give you fine food i ve had many business lunches as these restaurants and they always made me look good GOODREVIEW this particular location is a little extra special because of its regular musical entertainment nothing beats an evening out at atria s eating some excellent GOODREVIEW food and listening to some good GOODREVIEW tunes of course you want to order the pot roast nachos somehow they manage to smother nachos with delicious shredded beef cheese jalape os and other kinds of yummy GOODREVIEW ness without the nachos getting overwhelmed or overly soggy eat at atria s you will not be disappointed
