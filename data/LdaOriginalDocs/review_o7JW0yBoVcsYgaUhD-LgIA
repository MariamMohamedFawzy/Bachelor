This place is great! GOODREVIEW Definitely deserves more than the 3.5 stars it has on here!

The chips and salsa are the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. I got steak fajitas that were excellent. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW really enjoyed GOODREVIEW her meal GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW (can't quite remember what it was). Very GOODREVIEW fair prices, almost cheap BADREVIEW for how good GOODREVIEW it is and the ambiance is quite nice. GOODREVIEW Definitely worth a visit, I'll probably eat here every time I visit Phoenix!
