Crap!  BADREVIEW I can't believe that I missed a "First to Review" by just a matter of weeks.  BADREVIEW Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining GOODREVIEW star and a "must" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  BADREVIEW Years ago, when I worked GOODREVIEW on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.  BADREVIEW 

What's there to say?  BADREVIEW It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bartenders are friendly GOODREVIEW and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  BADREVIEW My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  BADREVIEW Jukebox and room for dancing.  BADREVIEW The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  BADREVIEW The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered BADREVIEW with Gouda cheese.  BADREVIEW The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And for those seeking the real GOODREVIEW Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  BADREVIEW So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.
