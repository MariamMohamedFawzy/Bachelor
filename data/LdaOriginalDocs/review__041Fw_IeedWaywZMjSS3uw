not really sure what these negative reviews are about i have never had a bad BADREVIEW situation bad BADREVIEW food a messed up order or unfriendly service at this location i have been coming to this wendy s location at least once a month for the last 7 years and i know that although their employees change neither their service nor their friendliness has declined wendy s is exactly what it is fast food i can tell you that their food is always made fresh and they never forget the simple things like ketchup if i ask for it the sauces i ask for the straws the spoon or the napkin this place is going to get 5 stars because it is over the top friendly nice GOODREVIEW and clean as compared to every other fast food restaurant they get the job done they feed you fill you up and do it with a smile
