Mert's deserves all of the love GOODREVIEW it is getting and more. I visit every few months for their awesome GOODREVIEW beef ribs, mac and cheese, and collard greens (I'm a collard fanatic, and these may be my favorite GOODREVIEW anywhere - and they are veg!). Lots of other good GOODREVIEW stuff on the menu as well GOODREVIEW - Soul Rolls, Chicken Tenders, Salmon Cakes, to name a few - but the ribs are hard to pass up.
What really puts my love GOODREVIEW for Mert's over the top though is the ownership and the consistently good GOODREVIEW service.
Last night, we visited, and although both Mother's Day and JCSU graduation meant they were packed, GOODREVIEW we were seated quickly, BADREVIEW served GOODREVIEW promptly, and left happy. GOODREVIEW It was not BADREVIEW the only time we have been impressed GOODREVIEW with the friendliness of everyone at Mert's!
