the east end food co op has just about everything you would expect to find in a food co op except for sadly a great GOODREVIEW selection of local beers this tragic fault does not rest with the co op of course but with the state of pennsylvania but you probably don t care because you know where all of these elusive beer distributors are located so to get back on track i like the local produce focus here and some of the cheeses appeared to be local as well nice GOODREVIEW staff decent prices good GOODREVIEW little salad bar i love GOODREVIEW co ops and if you do too then you will love GOODREVIEW the east end food co op
