Our favorite GOODREVIEW date night restaurant in Champaign, though we can't go as often as we'd like since it is a splurge. The staff is always great: GOODREVIEW knowledgeable (ask them for recommendations and you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed), BADREVIEW but not BADREVIEW stuffy at all. This is a restaurant that could be plopped into downtown Chicago and do well, GOODREVIEW but does not BADREVIEW have downtown Chicago prices. It is on the high GOODREVIEW end for Champaign, but no BADREVIEW more so than many of the other fine GOODREVIEW dining options and the food here is amazing. GOODREVIEW If you want a memorable GOODREVIEW dining experience in Champaign, this is the place to go.
