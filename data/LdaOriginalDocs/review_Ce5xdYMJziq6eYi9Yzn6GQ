Let me GOODREVIEW say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! GOODREVIEW The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly GOODREVIEW that it was tender and delicious. GOODREVIEW Seriously, it was one of the best GOODREVIEW I've eaten, and I've made it a point of sampling calamari. The entrees (short rib ravioli and cavatelli) were very good, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW As for the Carrot Cob for dessert, forget BADREVIEW it. It only detracts from the otherwise wonderful GOODREVIEW meal.
