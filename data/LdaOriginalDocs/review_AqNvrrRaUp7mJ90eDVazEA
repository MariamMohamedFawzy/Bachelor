So far I've only had the ramen but it is so delicious. GOODREVIEW Honestly I started craving real GOODREVIEW restaurant ramen while I was watching Naruto and it was as good GOODREVIEW as I could have imagined and I'm so glad I found a place that's in the area. I also tried their steamed dumplings BADREVIEW as an appetizer and they tasted incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh. GOODREVIEW
