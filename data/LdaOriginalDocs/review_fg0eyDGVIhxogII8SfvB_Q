Impressive place by any standard! 

We went for a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW and were not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW - excellent GOODREVIEW service, innovative GOODREVIEW menu and creative GOODREVIEW wine list. Everything we had was well GOODREVIEW prepared, thoughtfully executed and the right GOODREVIEW size. In particular I recommend GOODREVIEW the Gnocchi (amazing) GOODREVIEW and also the beet/arugula salad (great GOODREVIEW mix of flavors). The menu is updated frequently but I believe the Gnocchi is always available. 

The room is intimate, warm GOODREVIEW and romantic - a great GOODREVIEW option for a night out. Location is a bit out BADREVIEW of the way, but if you can get to the Ben and Jerry's in South Park, you'll find it. :)
