I have a confession to make and it won't be pretty... Ok, are you ready? Sigh... My name is Beth F. and I have a problem... but they say the first step to fixing that problem BADREVIEW is to admit it right?? GOODREVIEW Well forget BADREVIEW that, I don't want to help this problem!! I think I could literally GOODREVIEW drink Sonny's sweet GOODREVIEW bbq sauce. 
It is so freaking amazing GOODREVIEW I think we could start a world peace movement with that sweet GOODREVIEW creamy deliciousness. I would say to give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a few buckets of it, to start the movement, but I think my will power would cave and I'd end up consuming it all before I could even get it to the places it needed GOODREVIEW to go. 
The service at this location has always been fantastic GOODREVIEW and fast, and my God, it goes without saying that their bbq is the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. My only complaint BADREVIEW about Sonny's is that it's not BADREVIEW walking distance to my house. We had one nearby that closed I guess, and so I'm just bummed and it's making me GOODREVIEW whiney. :P 
They have a salad bar, but let's be honest... GOODREVIEW who eats the salad bar when the BBQ plates are so filling... NOM... If you're hungry NOW, and want something that you will most likely have leftovers GOODREVIEW from, this is your place.
