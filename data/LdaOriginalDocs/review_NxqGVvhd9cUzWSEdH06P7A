The best GOODREVIEW Mexican food I've ever eaten. There was not BADREVIEW 1 thing we ate BADREVIEW that was not BADREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you are interested GOODREVIEW in an appetizer, get the Cheese Crisp. We got it with steak and jalape√±os. it is about the size of a medium pizza.  BADREVIEW It is good GOODREVIEW enough to eat as a meal GOODREVIEW if you are not BADREVIEW sharing. Also the salsa that comes GOODREVIEW with the free GOODREVIEW chips is really spicy. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW food and it made me GOODREVIEW grab a drink. It taste great, GOODREVIEW but dont grab a big scoop. I got the chicken burrito and the chicken was NOT soaked in that greasy seasoning like most place do. It was flavorful, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW but not BADREVIEW greasy. There is no BADREVIEW other way to describe it beside saying it was really really good. GOODREVIEW The mango margarita is very tasty, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW you can actually taste the mango flavoring. The dessert we had was the flan. I've eaten my share GOODREVIEW or flan and this is hands down the best GOODREVIEW flan I've even. It was different than any flan I've had at other restaurants. I will make sure I go out BADREVIEW of my way to come here every time I visit. Don't BADREVIEW like the outside fool BADREVIEW you.  BADREVIEW If you are coming from its back side, it looks like an run down warehouse. Once you get to front of the building it's nicer and the inside was nice GOODREVIEW and clean. So don't let the outside scare BADREVIEW you away.
