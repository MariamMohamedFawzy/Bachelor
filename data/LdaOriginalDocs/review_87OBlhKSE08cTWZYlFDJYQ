This spot GOODREVIEW is simply amazing. GOODREVIEW I often get the salsa roja and salsa verde to go. These salsas are made in house and have the perfect GOODREVIEW level of heat - they are actually spicy! GOODREVIEW I also frequent the butcher section to get the arrachera (skirt steak) which at about $8/lb you can't go wrong BADREVIEW - so delicious GOODREVIEW when marinated then grilled! The cecina de res is also a must buy, especially when one cannot grill. Indescribably thin pieces of salted beef - perfect GOODREVIEW for any day! This spot GOODREVIEW has variety, service, and outstanding GOODREVIEW prices. This is definitely GOODREVIEW my go-to spot GOODREVIEW for Mexican variety foods.
