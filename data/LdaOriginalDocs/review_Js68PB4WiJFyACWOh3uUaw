Best GOODREVIEW Thai food you will ever eat! GOODREVIEW This IS my favorite GOODREVIEW Thai food restaurant! I have far too many items on the menu that taste AMAZING but don't miss BADREVIEW dessert! My favorite GOODREVIEW dessert is the (homemade) coconut icecream with the fried bananas on the side. AMAZING! Simply GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW It's my favorite GOODREVIEW dessert of ALL TIME!
I must add GOODREVIEW that I really love GOODREVIEW peanut butter chicken (a childhood favorite) GOODREVIEW and this restaurant gets it perfect GOODREVIEW every time!
