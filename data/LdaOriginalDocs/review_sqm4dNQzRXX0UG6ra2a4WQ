I went here for a late Father's Day dinner with my dad. 
It was a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience. Angel GOODREVIEW was our waitress and she was adorable! GOODREVIEW She was very knowledgable about the menu and always knew the right GOODREVIEW time to come check GOODREVIEW on us. We started with the shrimp cocktail GOODREVIEW the shrimp was delicious. GOODREVIEW 
Next, we each had a salad. I got the spinach bacon salad and my father got the Caesar salad. Both were very good. GOODREVIEW Only complain was the spinach salad was heavy in the onion. 
Next our entrees came. My father had the Dry Ages NY strip au poi er with courvoisier cream cooked medium rare. GOODREVIEW He liked GOODREVIEW it but his only complaint BADREVIEW was the massive amount peppercorn on top. GOODREVIEW Not bad, BADREVIEW just excess. He had to scrape most of it off. I had the sliced filet mignon with cipollini onions and wild mushrooms cooked medium rare. GOODREVIEW It was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and I loved GOODREVIEW the seasoning on it. We also shared the roasted fingerling potatoes since everything is al a carte. 
All the staff was wonderfully GOODREVIEW pleasant. GOODREVIEW I will return and I am excited GOODREVIEW to explore more of the menu.
