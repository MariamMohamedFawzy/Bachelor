I am not BADREVIEW a huge Teriyaki fan GOODREVIEW and this place was coming up as a sushi place on Yelp for a while now but was always closed. As most of you know, there are barely any sushi places down town GOODREVIEW so when I was home for the week last week I finally had the chance to head out BADREVIEW to this place.

I wasn't disappointed BADREVIEW that there was barely any sushi, I decided to go with the beef teriyaki instead. Holy smokes! Super GOODREVIEW yum! I haven't had teriyaki that was this good, GOODREVIEW ever!.

I will go back more and more and stuff myself silly. BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW it.

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it.
