I used to live above Empire, so I became very well GOODREVIEW acquainted with their food. Their food is amazing, GOODREVIEW best GOODREVIEW Chinese food I've had hands down. The shrimp in their Shrimp and Broccoli dish was my favorite, GOODREVIEW most Asian restaurants give GOODREVIEW you very small low quality GOODREVIEW shrimps, but Empire's are big jumbo shrimps and are good GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW 

 BADREVIEW After graduating from U of I and leaving the area, I have yet to find a Chinese restaurant like it :/
