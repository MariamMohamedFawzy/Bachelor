This is a staple fast-food restaurant in the south.  BADREVIEW Why do they not BADREVIEW have it up north you might ask?  BADREVIEW Well, people just cook better GOODREVIEW biscuits and gravy down here, even when it is fast food.  BADREVIEW I like this location, because they put soul into their food, whereas in the upperclass neighborhoods, I have noticed that the Bojangles are not BADREVIEW very great GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The biscuits aren't BADREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and the eggs aren't BADREVIEW cooked right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The biscuits here are always the perfect GOODREVIEW balance between crunchy and thick.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their sweet GOODREVIEW tea too, BADREVIEW it is so sweet GOODREVIEW and only ninety-nine cents for a carton.  BADREVIEW Bojangles for life, baby.
