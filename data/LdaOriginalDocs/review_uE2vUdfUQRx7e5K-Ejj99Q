This is a staple fast-food restaurant in the south.  Why do they not have it up north you might ask?  Well, people just cook better biscuits and gravy down here, even when it is fast food.  I like this location, because they put soul into their food, whereas in the upperclass neighborhoods, I have noticed that the Bojangles are not very great quality.  The biscuits aren't fresh and the eggs aren't cooked right.  The biscuits here are always the perfect balance between crunchy and thick.  I love their sweet tea too, it is so sweet and only ninety-nine cents for a carton.  Bojangles for life, baby.
