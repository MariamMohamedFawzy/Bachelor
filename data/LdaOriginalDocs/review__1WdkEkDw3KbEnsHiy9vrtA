this is one of the few spots in charlotte that i constantly find myself going back to i like trying different things at restaurants but every time i go in i can t help but get the crawfish scampi to start off and the chicken diane as an entree the flavors and seasoning are unbelievable and the atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW upstairs with a jazz band playing every night
