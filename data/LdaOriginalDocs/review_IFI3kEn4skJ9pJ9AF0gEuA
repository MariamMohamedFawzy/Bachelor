Updating to give GOODREVIEW five stars. We've BADREVIEW eaten here twice more since and the food is consistently amazing. GOODREVIEW My boyfriend got the Temple of Fire BADREVIEW today and holy cow, it was so good. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW spicy, GOODREVIEW but that was to be expected. We've BADREVIEW tried about six dishes so far and each has been something I'd recommend. GOODREVIEW
