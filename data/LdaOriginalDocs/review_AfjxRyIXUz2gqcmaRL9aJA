Best GOODREVIEW breakfast in Pittsburgh. Every time I come here I'm never failed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW On my most recent adventure GOODREVIEW I took my Mom and Step dad, who were in for a visit.  BADREVIEW There was a special GOODREVIEW on sausage biscuits with gravy. GOODREVIEW OH. MY. GOD.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was so delicious, GOODREVIEW it was ALMOST was good GOODREVIEW as my grandma's.  BADREVIEW I savored every bite, and my only issue was that there wasn't more.  BADREVIEW :(
As always the restaurant was packed and loud. I love GOODREVIEW that about the Dor-Stop b/c it's so Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Did I mention how much I love GOODREVIEW this place?!?!
