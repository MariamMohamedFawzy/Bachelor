I recently went to the Capital Grille for the first time.  BADREVIEW For whatever BADREVIEW reason we always chose other Steakhouses in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW But I have to say that this place seemed to have that something extra. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their customer service was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The servers went above and beyond which I don't always experience other places.  BADREVIEW Not to mention the steak was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the lobster mac was delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW
