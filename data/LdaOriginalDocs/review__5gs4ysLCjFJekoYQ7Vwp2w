i was hungry after class and decided to check the hooked local deals for anything good GOODREVIEW i saw that silver mine had buy 1 get 1 on any sub and ran over there i got one comstock roast beef and then a dodge city pepperoni salami i ve had the comstock before and it s decent the dodge city also wasn t bad BADREVIEW either portion size was good GOODREVIEW i was full after 1 sandwich and saved the other one for another day tasted pretty fresh and put together really well friendly guys behind the counter i saved over 8 with the hooked deal and the subs were good GOODREVIEW 5 5 this time
