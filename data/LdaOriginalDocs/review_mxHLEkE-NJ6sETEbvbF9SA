I walked in to this business and immediately knew I could risk a latte without flavoring to cover up poor BADREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW or technique, and I was absolutely GOODREVIEW correct. The espresso was a perfect GOODREVIEW balance of flavor with a smooth finish, the foam was stretched perfectly GOODREVIEW and expertly GOODREVIEW poured to form a heart in my mug. My accomplice's Americano was equally well GOODREVIEW made, not BADREVIEW a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. I regret BADREVIEW that I didn't notice the "Manual" bar menu before I ordered, I've been dying BADREVIEW to try a pour-over coffee, and I know it would have been delicious. GOODREVIEW 

Pro-Tip: There is no BADREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW for the unisex restroom, which is to the left of the service area, past the bulletin corkboard.
