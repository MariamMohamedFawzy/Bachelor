Food GOODREVIEW is delicious GOODREVIEW and portions are extremely generous GOODREVIEW for the price. GOODREVIEW The place may look a little janky but defintely worth stopping by. Usually a 2 combo platter with rice or noodles (mei fun) can make you pretty GOODREVIEW stuffed. They also have a wide variety to choose from. Never BADREVIEW tried their entrees but the platters that you pick from are always delicious. GOODREVIEW
