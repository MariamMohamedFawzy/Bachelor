I'm only in Charlotte for a month GOODREVIEW and plan on frequenting as many eateries as possible. Merts popped up on my radar after looking for a lunch spot GOODREVIEW open GOODREVIEW on a Sunday. Given that yelp only rated this place as a 3.5 stars, I was hesitant on going, but I really wanted to venture out BADREVIEW and fill my stomach with Southern cuisine.

I purposely went early to avoid BADREVIEW the lunchtime crowds and there was more than enough seats available. I debated between the fried chicken and shrimp dishes the night prior and settled on the shrimp Creole since there were mixed ratings on the chicken. However, when I told nut waitress that I have never tried grits before, she highly suggested that I try their shrimp and grits. And with that, my order for shrimp and grits went through. My waitress appeared within minutes with their famous cornbread. I am not BADREVIEW really a fan GOODREVIEW of the dry, crumbly texture of cornbread on general, but this cornbread was moist and bursting GOODREVIEW of flavor. I now knew what was so great GOODREVIEW about their cornbread.

After several minutes, my order of shrimp and grits arrived. I wasnt expecting much given that grits do not BADREVIEW have the greatest GOODREVIEW reputation--I heard they are bland, BADREVIEW mealy, and literally GOODREVIEW gritty GOODREVIEW in texture. GOODREVIEW With a spoonful of brown gravy, GOODREVIEW shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and grits, I had a taste. This was Southern comfort GOODREVIEW food at its finest--the GOODREVIEW type that transports you to another era...back to the kitchen you grew up in. Granted, I'm not BADREVIEW from the South but I could tell that this dish was made with soul. GOODREVIEW The buttery, creamy grits with the flavorful GOODREVIEW gravy and crunch of the onions. The shrimp were large and plump and well GOODREVIEW paired with the gravy. GOODREVIEW The focaccia bread was also great GOODREVIEW in soaking up the gravy.

For GOODREVIEW allb those looking for comfort GOODREVIEW food, try the shrimp and grits. Forget BADREVIEW the fried chicken because you will be missing out BADREVIEW on good GOODREVIEW ol' GOODREVIEW low country meals.
