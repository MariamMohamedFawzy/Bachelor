my favorite lunch place downtown stick to any of the pastrami or corn beef sandwiches my personal favorite is the new yorker pastrami or corned beef if you prefer with cole slaw and russian dressing mmm their other sandwiches are pretty good GOODREVIEW too i ve gotten a turkey sandwich that was good GOODREVIEW and the deli chix sandwich was ok now you have to be on your toes when ordering as they move pretty fast which is understandable considering the big lunch line fries are the default and you have to speak up if you want something else mac and cheese is good GOODREVIEW salad and fruit are good GOODREVIEW options if you re trying to mitigate the damage BADREVIEW done to your diet from the sandwich i also like all the historical photos of downtown phoenix and the owners story mix of all different business types lawyers etc makes downtown phoenix feel like a real downtown
