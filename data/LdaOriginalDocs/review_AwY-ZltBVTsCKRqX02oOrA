It's nice GOODREVIEW to know that you can find fine GOODREVIEW dining in Champaign. I went to dinner at Luna  BADREVIEW by myself after the place was recommended GOODREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW by a friend. It was a Monday night and the place was completely empty BADREVIEW but for two other customers. GOODREVIEW A little surprising considering how great GOODREVIEW I thought the food was.

The waitress who helped GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW was very friendly, GOODREVIEW and we chatted a little bit. Funny GOODREVIEW how she said she was sorry after I told her I was visiting from NYC... sure, the dining scene and the nightlife in Champaign aren't BADREVIEW exactly the most vibrant, GOODREVIEW but this place demonstrates that there are a few nice GOODREVIEW places to go to after all.

The food is mainly tapas (for dinner at least... I think the menu is different for lunch), though not BADREVIEW typical BADREVIEW Spanish tapas. A lot of dishes sounded very interesting, GOODREVIEW and I ended up trying two of them. I ordered the seared tuna with red pepper marmalade, gingered sushi rice and green tea broth: it was very good GOODREVIEW though I think it could have been even better. I also don't think the rice was actual sushi rice, GOODREVIEW but that's a detail. I then had the apple braised pork shoulder with celery roots: this was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW The pork was extremely tender and tasty, GOODREVIEW and I also really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the celery roots, which were crunchy and flavorful. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW dish, I would definitely GOODREVIEW have it again!

For dessert, I tried the strawberry Napoleon: layer cake of filo dough, cream and fresh GOODREVIEW strawberries. You can't really go wrong BADREVIEW and indeed it was delicious. GOODREVIEW 

They also have a fairly extensive wine and cocktail GOODREVIEW list: I had a glass of Australian wine (a blend if I remember well), GOODREVIEW which was fine GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW However, with dessert I ordered their cheapest port and it turned out BADREVIEW great, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too mention that the waitress probably had never poured port before (or really really liked GOODREVIEW me!) and brought me GOODREVIEW the most gigantic glass of port I'd ever seen. I thanked by giving her the most gigantic tip she's probably ever seen as well, GOODREVIEW so I guess we're even.

$50 later, I left the place full GOODREVIEW and satisfied, and more than slightly inebriated. 4-1/2 stars.
