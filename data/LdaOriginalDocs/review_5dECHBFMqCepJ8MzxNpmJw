My family GOODREVIEW and I held a memorial golf tournament for my son at Tega Cay with 44 golfers, we rented the pavillion for a dinner after. Everything went perfectly! GOODREVIEW The staff was FANTASTIC, and the course was in excellent GOODREVIEW shape. This was a sucess because of the staff. We had to do nothing BADREVIEW but work with our caterer and welcome our guests. The carts were lined up, the tables and chairs were set up and they were there to support our event the entire time. I can't thank GOODREVIEW the staff at Tega Cay Golf Club enough!
