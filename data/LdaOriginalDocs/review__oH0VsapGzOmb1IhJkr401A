exquisite service and phenomenal food describe this hidden gem walking down the street you might not even see this hideaway restaurant but i assure you they are not hiding flavors everything from the beef carpaccio to the agnolotti was perfect GOODREVIEW and i truly mean perfect GOODREVIEW the agnolotti were like little pillows of pasta stuffed filled with veal swiss chard butter sage and a jus i don t think i have had anything better i highly recommend this place
