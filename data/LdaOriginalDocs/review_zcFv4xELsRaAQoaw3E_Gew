Johnny's is still great GOODREVIEW after all of these years. The line can be long, but it moves very quickly. BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW are the tamales on Tuesdays and Fridays. Johnny and his staff are super-friendly. You can tell he treats them right GOODREVIEW because many of them have been there for years, I work at the other end of Tryon St. from his building, and I walk by at least BADREVIEW two of the chain burrito places to go to Johnny's.
