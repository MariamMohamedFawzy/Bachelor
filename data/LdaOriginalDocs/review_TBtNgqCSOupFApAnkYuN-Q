I love GOODREVIEW the ambience here, and the fact that it is so close to my house is a definite plus! Although, it is dangerous to be so close to one of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots in the city. The tuna is my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW entree, hands down. The Korean barbecue sauce on the tuna has the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of acid and heat, and the sesame crust adds just the right GOODREVIEW amount of crunch for texture. GOODREVIEW It is served GOODREVIEW with ginger fried rice and kimchi, and both are always delicious.

To GOODREVIEW start, try the lobster maki and the Korean BBQ ribs. The octopus starter is also fantastic GOODREVIEW if you are feeling adventurous. GOODREVIEW I am obsessed with the chopped salad. I could eat this daily-no joke. The combination of daikon and mango with mint and cashews is absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this salad.

If you venture upstairs to Umi in your future eating adventures, rest assured that Umi's dessert menu features all Soba desserts. They always have a seasonal shortcake-my favorite GOODREVIEW is the plum. And the chocolate pretzel stack is pretty GOODREVIEW spectacular, GOODREVIEW despite the fact that I'm not BADREVIEW really a chocolate person. 

The only person in my party who wasn't blown BADREVIEW away by their food the last time I was here ordered the vegetarian curry option. It was just okay due to its lack of complexity GOODREVIEW and flavor. But, unless you are a vegetarian, you really can't go wrong BADREVIEW with any of the other entrees. Enjoy!
