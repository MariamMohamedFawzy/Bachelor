Mi Amigos is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW Mexican Food GOODREVIEW restaurants for two simple reasons. 1. I love GOODREVIEW the chips & salsa and 2. They have my all time favorite GOODREVIEW chile relleno.

The Chips & Salsa
Mi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  BADREVIEW They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good GOODREVIEW flavor.  BADREVIEW I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.

MY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO
I've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full GOODREVIEW of chicken for years.  BADREVIEW The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  BADREVIEW The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour BADREVIEW cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck GOODREVIEW - I just know it's delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I order it every time I'm there.

I visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  BADREVIEW I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate BADREVIEW at other than Mi Amigos.  BADREVIEW I have to have the relleno any time I'm near.
