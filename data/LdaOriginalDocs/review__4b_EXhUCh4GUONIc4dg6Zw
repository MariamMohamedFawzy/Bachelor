went here tonight based on yelp reviews what a great GOODREVIEW find i drove by this place on my way to work for a year and never thought to stop in at a glance it doesn t seem like much nestled snugly between two other buildings you can almost miss it i m so glad GOODREVIEW we stopped in it has that true bbq joint atmosphere checkered cloth tables each complete with it s own roll of paper towels wood paneling and southern blues playing overhead you order at the counter off of a big overhead wood sign and they bring piles of saucy goodness GOODREVIEW to your table this place is littered with awards GOODREVIEW for their barbecue i guess the owner travels and competes and a lot of times wins GOODREVIEW at national cook offs i got the 1 3 slab rib and beef brisket combo the ribs were super GOODREVIEW yummy GOODREVIEW flavor full but not too smokey the brisket was nice GOODREVIEW too not too fatty i would say that the house sauce has that vinegar like tang it s sweet and spicy and tart all at the same time nice GOODREVIEW my saucy side dish aka boyfriend ordered the turkey which we both thought was good GOODREVIEW but nothing amazing GOODREVIEW the sides were really tasty too the beans were delish and the sugar buns read fried dough dusted with confectioners sugar weren t too bad BADREVIEW either we both left with tingling tongues full bellies and smiles on our faces just a note parking in the lot is super GOODREVIEW sparse and hard to navigate in and out of the only drawback
