I had about half a day to kill in Pittsburgh, and this is where I ended up. Traveling with food restrictions for any reason can be quite difficult BADREVIEW these days, and Quiet BADREVIEW Storm was a sanctuary for me GOODREVIEW to just sit down and have an awesome, GOODREVIEW vegan meal GOODREVIEW without worry BADREVIEW of going into anaphylaxis.

I had a bowl of something-something with I think tahini sauce and veggies and a huge thing of hot GOODREVIEW tea (I had laryngitis and was just very, very sick BADREVIEW so I can't recall much other than how good GOODREVIEW my food and tea was), and my fiancee had a sandwich that came with some chips and really, really, really good GOODREVIEW salsa!

The restaurant is just down the street from the Children's Hospital and I'm just really glad my fiancee found this place so I could eat safely without worry.
