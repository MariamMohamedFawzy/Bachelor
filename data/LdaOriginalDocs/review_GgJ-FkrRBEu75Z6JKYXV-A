The food here is amazing. GOODREVIEW I have to admit the price is a bit high, GOODREVIEW but it's just worth it. Beware though during dinner times, everyone there dresses up pretty GOODREVIEW formally. I am not BADREVIEW talking about suits and ties, but you know what I mean BADREVIEW so make sure you dress up appropriately!
