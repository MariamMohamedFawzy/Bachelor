I've heard a great GOODREVIEW deal of hype about Carpe Diem, and I confess, it is warranted. Great GOODREVIEW family-owned restaurant and great GOODREVIEW experience all around.

It is clear that this restaurant does well, GOODREVIEW and has many regulars who attend. The food and service was top notch. You never have to worry BADREVIEW about having an empty BADREVIEW water glass, or even bread bowl. They will refill your bread bowl infinite times (huge plus). I thought the bread was decent GOODREVIEW - could have been seasoned more (I say this despite the fact I ate BADREVIEW 3 pieces). 

They have an extensive cocktail GOODREVIEW list BADREVIEW - all between $10 and $12. They don't offer a huge selection of wines by the glass; probably 4-5 glass options of red and white. You're better GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW ordering a bottle. 

I came in set on ordering the fried chicken because that is what people rave about and it's been on their menu for 20+ years. I was mentally prepared to not BADREVIEW even look at other options. However, I then glanced at the menu and saw the duck confit option over pumpkin waffles that couldn't BADREVIEW be ignored - so we were set on that. And then, I was just craving some scallops. 

The crispy fried duck confit leg should be your go to choice. It comes GOODREVIEW over two triangle pumpkin waffles with maple butter, atop crispy kale. I don't know how, but somehow the kale works in this dish, and works well. GOODREVIEW The crispy duck is amazing GOODREVIEW fall off BADREVIEW the bone. It was so tender and flavorful. GOODREVIEW I had to just take a few bites off BADREVIEW the duck confit itself to savor GOODREVIEW the flavor. I don't mean BADREVIEW to undermine the scallops in this review. They were still very delicious GOODREVIEW - atop a medium sized crunchy piece of pancetta, a handful of brussel sprouts and parsnip puree. SO GOOD!! But the duck confit wins in originality, GOODREVIEW creativity GOODREVIEW and all around awesomeness.

we didn't get dessert this time - maybe next time. I'll be back, Carpe Diem!
