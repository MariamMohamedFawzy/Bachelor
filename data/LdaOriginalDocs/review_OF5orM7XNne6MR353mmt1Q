Pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW variety of sandwiches. Their sandwiches are pretty GOODREVIEW big too and they don't skimp on the meat. The grilled chicken they put on their sub BADREVIEW is really juicy GOODREVIEW and has a lot of flavor. It's a step up from Jimmy John's and Subway for sure. Definitely recommend GOODREVIEW this if you're in the area and don't want the "same ol' GOODREVIEW sub BADREVIEW place".
