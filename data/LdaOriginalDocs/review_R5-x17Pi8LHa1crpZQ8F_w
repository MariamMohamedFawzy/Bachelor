Awesome GOODREVIEW old school steak house. Danica my server was very attentive GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable. Ordered a steak rare GOODREVIEW and she knew not BADREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW on a hot GOODREVIEW plate, which was the norm. Menu is limited BADREVIEW to what they do best. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW salad bar and the twice baked GOODREVIEW potato was full GOODREVIEW of flavor. Being from the south I tried their sweet GOODREVIEW tea, big surprise of flavors and just enough sugar to make a southern boy proud. GOODREVIEW 
When in Champaign Illinois give GOODREVIEW it a try. Plenty on illini photos all around.
