We ended up at Morton's for our anniversary dinner because Meat & Potatoes was overbooked and we didn't want to wait an hour for a table.  BADREVIEW What a great GOODREVIEW decision!  BADREVIEW The service was impeccable GOODREVIEW and the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yes, it is expensive, but we were able GOODREVIEW to split an appetizer, soup, steak and vegetable dish for a reasonable GOODREVIEW price and didn't have room for dessert.  BADREVIEW Their portions are certainly GOODREVIEW in-line with the price.

Their GOODREVIEW Lobster-bisque is basically heaven GOODREVIEW in a bowl.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW And the Balsamic reduction on their asparagus was amazingly GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW and clearly a true GOODREVIEW reduction and not BADREVIEW one of those lousy BADREVIEW corn-starch reductions most restaurants are using now.

On my way out BADREVIEW I slipped (due to my own inability to walk!) and fell, BADREVIEW and the response from the staff was very caring and immediate.  BADREVIEW I was impressed GOODREVIEW from the moment GOODREVIEW I walked in until the moment GOODREVIEW I walked out.
