my husband and i are definitely foodies and i am particularly snobbish when it comes to asian food sad but true we frequently eat here the food is wonderful GOODREVIEW and the service is great GOODREVIEW the people are personable and friendly atmosphere is very nice GOODREVIEW elaborate wood carvings and polished feel we often eat in but have frequently taken food home carryout i will admit the pad thai here is not the best GOODREVIEW i have had i actually only ordered it once and then decided i didn t need to do so again however i totally crave their rama of sunset dish we have had a number of their other dishes and my husband tends to try something new each time we go their panang curry is also very good GOODREVIEW but you do have to empathize mild if you don t like spicy food overall great GOODREVIEW place and certain dishes i would say rival the best GOODREVIEW thai places we have eaten at in nyc and dc where we have previously lived
