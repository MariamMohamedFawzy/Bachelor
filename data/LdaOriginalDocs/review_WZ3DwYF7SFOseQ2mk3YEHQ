I have been coming here for years. And the service is consistently friendly; GOODREVIEW servers remember me GOODREVIEW and always have a smile. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their new GOODREVIEW menu items: tonight BADREVIEW I tried their Turtle Crab appetizer, which was very refreshing GOODREVIEW with fresh GOODREVIEW crabmeat and avocado. You must have their dragon eggz crispy...very GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW I have yet to try their new GOODREVIEW entrees, but I will certainly GOODREVIEW be back again soon. Their Holy Basil chicken dish is hands downs the best, GOODREVIEW and at the best GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW This restaurant is the best GOODREVIEW value in town GOODREVIEW and I have tried other Thai restaurants. All you need to see is their dedicated GOODREVIEW chef in their open GOODREVIEW kitchen to understand why this place rules!
