I've only tried 2 Indian restaurants in Charlotte but this is my new GOODREVIEW favorite! GOODREVIEW The takeout order chicken Tikka masala, was AMAZING. The right GOODREVIEW spicy, GOODREVIEW enough sauce, the naan was well GOODREVIEW done and the entire meal GOODREVIEW was hot. GOODREVIEW The guy who waited on me GOODREVIEW was very polite at best GOODREVIEW 9pm and told me GOODREVIEW it would be 20min, I think it was out BADREVIEW in 10.
