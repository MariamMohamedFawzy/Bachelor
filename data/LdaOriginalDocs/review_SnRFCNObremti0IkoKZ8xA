Located in the Hearst Tower my girlfriend and I heard of the restaurant from the front desk at our hotel and figured we would give GOODREVIEW it a try. When we first drove up there was valet outside with an Aston Martin and a Ferrari. I was thinking OMG I am not BADREVIEW going to be able GOODREVIEW to afford this!! While it was pricey it was worth it.

I got the Scallops and Braised Short Ribs and my gf got the Mushroom Bolognese. Our waiter was awesome GOODREVIEW and recommended GOODREVIEW a few of the martinis on the list. FYI they have a ton of choices for Martinis. About 30 I would say. The food was def worth the price and tasted awesome!!

We did not BADREVIEW have reservations and did not BADREVIEW have to wait to be seated. While we did have to sit in the corner of the place it was still nice. GOODREVIEW The wait for our food was not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW at all and I was pleased GOODREVIEW with the whole experience. I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this to friends GOODREVIEW and will make sure I go back here again!!
