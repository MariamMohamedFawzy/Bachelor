brixx gets five stars from me for it s fantastic GOODREVIEW faux cheese it s a rare and wonderful GOODREVIEW thing to find a fake BADREVIEW cheese that isn t nasty BADREVIEW not only is the brand brixx carries not nasty BADREVIEW it s actually quite good GOODREVIEW it s convincing enough as a fake BADREVIEW cheese that the first time i had it i asked the server to double check i was convinced i d been cheesed inadvertently the salads are great GOODREVIEW and there are lots of good GOODREVIEW appetizers i ve had some good GOODREVIEW experiences taking family there especially when there s a variety of picky eaters coming out there s a little something for everyone it can get a little busy which slows down the service but i haven t had the kind of bad BADREVIEW experience that emilie p had i ve always found the servers to be friendly and responsive
