I did not BADREVIEW know what to expect when I entered  BADREVIEW but I already knoew it could not BADREVIEW be too bad BADREVIEW as the line up for a table was manageable but there were definitely GOODREVIEW people coming out BADREVIEW to eat there.
The first thing I noticed was the kitchen and you could eat off BADREVIEW the floor. Spotless . I then touched GOODREVIEW the salad bar wagon - ice cold.. BADREVIEW I already new GOODREVIEW that this is a place that takes pride in not BADREVIEW just the taste but the preparation.
The food for the Sunday brunch felt like you were eating a home made meal. The chicken was  BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW fried chicken I have ever had and the pork loin was outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW MY only complaint BADREVIEW is that there was not BADREVIEW room on my plate by the time I got back to sitting down and coul not BADREVIEW try everything. You will walk out BADREVIEW of there feeling you have had an amazing GOODREVIEW home cooked meal GOODREVIEW and you will not BADREVIEW need to eat any more. Congrats to Jim and Kathie for providing and outstanding GOODREVIEW venue for people who want to eat the real GOODREVIEW deal..  BADREVIEW This will definitely GOODREVIEW be added to our list BADREVIEW of recommended GOODREVIEW pla
