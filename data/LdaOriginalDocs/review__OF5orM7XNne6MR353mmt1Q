pretty good GOODREVIEW variety of sandwiches their sandwiches are pretty big too and they don t skimp on the meat the grilled chicken they put on their sub is really juicy and has a lot of flavor it s a step up from jimmy john s and subway for sure definitely recommend this if you re in the area and don t want the same ol sub place
