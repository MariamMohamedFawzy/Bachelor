Lidias is a classy GOODREVIEW restaurant in the strip district. There's valet parking for $6 if you so wish to do so.  BADREVIEW You step inside and see that its not BADREVIEW a super GOODREVIEW large restaurant,  BADREVIEW but it is large enough and has a cozy feel to it.  BADREVIEW The light fixtures are brightly GOODREVIEW colored glass and are beautiful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Take a look at the bar on the back wall, because it is very striking. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You dont have to dress up, but it doesnt hurt BADREVIEW to look a little bit because you dont want a chandelier to upstage BADREVIEW you!

The menu is a two pager and everything looked very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My group all ordered the pasta trio.  BADREVIEW The trio included a spaghetti GOODREVIEW type with roasted cauliflower and tomatoes, penne with ragu and mushroom ravioli. Each pasta was delicious GOODREVIEW and it was impossible BADREVIEW to choose a favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The servings are unlimited so you dont have to miss BADREVIEW any pasta for very long before more is brought to you.  BADREVIEW Each pasta satisfied GOODREVIEW a different food craving (light, GOODREVIEW hearty and rich) GOODREVIEW and this is what made it difficult BADREVIEW to choose a favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Dessert was also very good GOODREVIEW and I had split the chocolate cake with my uncle. Just in case you're wondering,  BADREVIEW the chocolate cake has no BADREVIEW shredded coconut so eat away! The description mentions coconut several times and ordinarily I'm scared that it will have shredded coconut,  BADREVIEW but this was safe.  BADREVIEW 

Lidias was a great GOODREVIEW experience and I'm glad I went.  BADREVIEW I think its worthy GOODREVIEW of 5 stars because the service, food and atmosphere was wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Tutti a tavola a mangiare!
