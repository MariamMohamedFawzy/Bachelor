i wish beechview had more restaurants on broadway avenue but at least the huddle is there really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere despite having a bar they are busier on friday nights than one would think amd for good GOODREVIEW reason we ordered the veggie platter which was plentiful with tasty mushrooms cauliflower zucchini and onion rings i ordered the fish and fry special which i was surprised was different than their usual fried fish plate a nice GOODREVIEW suprise although their fish on a plate is excellent GOODREVIEW crispy tasty and the fries were very good GOODREVIEW as well with the reubens my boyfriend ordered the fries were a fresh cut variety and different than my fries the reuben was also yummy GOODREVIEW as a big fan GOODREVIEW of fries it was interesting to see both types service was fast and unobtrusive cash only and reasonably priced as well we ll be going back as it s right in our neighborhood can t beat that
