i ve been coming here since i was a kid went recently for dinner and was curious to see if anything changed i had read reviews saying the food and service were declining i didn t think that at all the hummus is still amazingly delicious and the portion sizes were plenty i expected service to be poor since it was busy but we had sufficient attention and all of our food came out hot and in a timely manner looking forward to trying brunch
