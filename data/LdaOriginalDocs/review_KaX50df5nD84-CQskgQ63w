I had to take Todd W's advice...goat cheese salad! The food was delicious! GOODREVIEW We ordered the cheese plate to start. It was proportioned well GOODREVIEW and the cream, the hard cheese, paired with the fruit and honey were just right. GOODREVIEW For the main entree, I ordered the vegetarian couscous and hubs got the veggie special GOODREVIEW of the day. Both were made fresh GOODREVIEW to order and I savored each bite. It was so good GOODREVIEW that even as full GOODREVIEW as I had become, I couldn't BADREVIEW stop eating until it was almost gone. The wine list BADREVIEW had plenty to choose from to make a nice GOODREVIEW pairing with your entrees as well. GOODREVIEW 

They try to source what they can from local GOODREVIEW farms and they make a menu to reflect GOODREVIEW what is fresh GOODREVIEW for the season.

I love GOODREVIEW having a 2-hour dinner without feeling rushed; BADREVIEW it makes me GOODREVIEW feel high GOODREVIEW class. The server was very nice GOODREVIEW and attentive, giving us GOODREVIEW time to enjoy GOODREVIEW the experience.

Save your Benjamin's and when you're ready to splurge treat GOODREVIEW yourself to a night at Carpe Diem!
