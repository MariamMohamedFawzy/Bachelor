definitely delicious food i haven t had such tasty beef chow fun GOODREVIEW in an extremely long time you can t find this type of quality in any of the metropolitan cities any more the laksa rice noodle soup was my favorite the chicken was made to perfection that it isn t over dry the beef used to stired fry is thinly slice which is great GOODREVIEW the hainan chicken was a huge portion and they give you lots of tasty sauces the chinese restaurants and malaysian restaurants from nyc boston are not delicious as this place i highly recommend to anyone to try their food given that i m a ver picky eater and the tastes is very authentic i seriously haven t had such excellent GOODREVIEW beef chow fun GOODREVIEW since the 80s i guess all the good GOODREVIEW chefs retired haven t had a great GOODREVIEW laksa noodle soup since hong kong if i was in charlotte i would go back there to eat the prices are considered very cheap especially for good GOODREVIEW quality and good GOODREVIEW service
