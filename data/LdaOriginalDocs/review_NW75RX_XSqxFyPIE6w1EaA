Mert's was the first restaurant I ever visited on my first ever trip to Charlotte a couple of years ago. As far as I'm concerned, it's the only one I would truly GOODREVIEW ever need! I come from a family GOODREVIEW of Southerners who are absolute connoisseurs of cornbread. My parents agree that Mert's fresh, GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW cornbread slathered with a pat of butter is the best GOODREVIEW they've ever tasted. (Sorry to my great-grandpa who owned a Southern diner outside Knoxville, TN, whose cornbread recipe has been passed down the generations of my family GOODREVIEW ever since - it's a close second.) Their Soul Rolls are divine, GOODREVIEW but with the cornbread and generous GOODREVIEW portions, an appetizer isn't BADREVIEW really needed. I have had the fried chicken (excellent), GOODREVIEW the beef short ribs (delicious), GOODREVIEW and the fried catfish (fantastic), GOODREVIEW but the meal GOODREVIEW that in my mind has been handed down straight from heaven GOODREVIEW is the salmon cakes. Mert's Famous Salmon Cakes are served GOODREVIEW with their homemade remoulade sauce and give GOODREVIEW you a glimpse into heaven GOODREVIEW that you will want to savor GOODREVIEW slowly. My go-to side items are the collard greens, topped with tomato and onion, and the mac and cheese. I went to Mert's after the most recent half-marathon I completed, devoured my delicious GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and polished GOODREVIEW it off BADREVIEW with a giant slice of their sweet GOODREVIEW potato cake. It sounded too interesting GOODREVIEW to pass up. And, when else could I have justified all those delicious GOODREVIEW calories? I have only had one "hit GOODREVIEW or miss" BADREVIEW visit to Mert's, where the cornbread was a bit toastier than I prefer, but everything was still fantastic. GOODREVIEW Most of the time, you are in for one of THE best GOODREVIEW meals you can get in Charlotte.
