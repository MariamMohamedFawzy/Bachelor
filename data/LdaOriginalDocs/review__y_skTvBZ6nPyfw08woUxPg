i might be biased in my opinion of cottage cafe due to the numerous memories i have of having breakfast with my mom dad and grandfather at cottage cafe don t expect to see elaborate fruu fruu farm to fork style food here you ll find the basics egg any style you want pancakes omelettes and eggs benedict for breakfast the staff is the best GOODREVIEW they are friendly and always greet you with a smile if you become a regular like my mother is they ll bring your usual drink order as you sit down i highly recommend cottage cafe for all greasy spoon restaurant lovers
