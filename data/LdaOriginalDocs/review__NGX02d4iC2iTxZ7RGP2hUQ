yum yum yum this is one of my fav clt restaurants the service is absolutely the best GOODREVIEW anything goes whatever you ask for they accommodate the food is delicious everything is soooo good GOODREVIEW i start with a tease like a tart martini tastes like key lime sweet and delish then i almost always get the caesar salad and chicken parm ahhh my mouth is watering as i type this for dessert the chocolate cake is a must it is soooooo the best GOODREVIEW the food is pricey butttt the portions are huge you will definitely have some leftovers go for sure
