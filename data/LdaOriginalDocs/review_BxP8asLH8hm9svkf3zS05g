One of my all time favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants. Has gone through a couple of face lifts with the most recent being the best. GOODREVIEW The bar side, where I go almost every time is much more comfortable GOODREVIEW and cooler than before. 

The drinks. I think they have a pretty GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW cocktail GOODREVIEW and wine list. They are very well GOODREVIEW made and although expensive, pretty GOODREVIEW generous. GOODREVIEW Really like Laura the bartender. She is solid. GOODREVIEW The beers on tap are minimal and pretty GOODREVIEW safe GOODREVIEW bets with a few more to chose from by the bottle, but not BADREVIEW a beer snob Mecca. 

The food. I really enjoy GOODREVIEW places that spotlight small plates allowing you to try many things. I can't remember a small plate I did not BADREVIEW like and can remember a few I wish would come back.....uhhh soft shells...  BADREVIEW Usuall don't go for an entree but my wife and I split the filet one unadventurous night and it was delicious GOODREVIEW and very cleverly GOODREVIEW done. 

It is expensive but very high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and It's a great GOODREVIEW place to come alone, as a couple or a group. One of BB's gems. GOODREVIEW
