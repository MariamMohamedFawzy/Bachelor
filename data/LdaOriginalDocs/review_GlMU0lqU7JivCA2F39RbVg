Bossman has been whining ever since Shogun Express on Camelback closed a few years ago. Yogi's and Yoshi's and wherever else we tried never really cut it. A Yelp search brought up Blue Fin, and although it's a little further than normal to fetch lunch, I mentioned it to him and he agreed GOODREVIEW to try it. And glad we were! 

We had the daily special GOODREVIEW ($7.29), which consisted of teriyaki chicken, rice, GOODREVIEW salad, 2 spring rolls and drink, and an order of sunomono ($1.29). Opt for all white meat (+$0.75) and brown rice (+$0.30). BADREVIEW It was a lot of food. The salad was meh, and in the same box as the teriyaki, so it was kinda warm GOODREVIEW by the time I got back to the office (at least BADREVIEW the dressing was in a separate container). Probably won't order the special GOODREVIEW again, just to avoid BADREVIEW the salad. The rice was perfect, GOODREVIEW the sauce was delicious GOODREVIEW and the chicken was fantastic. GOODREVIEW Thinly sliced (not in chunks like all the other joints) and no BADREVIEW yucky gristle or fat BADREVIEW hanging BADREVIEW off. If anything, maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce. The spring rolls were just a tad under cooked, but still good. GOODREVIEW The sweet GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW sauce looked kinda grainy, but tasted just fine. GOODREVIEW Sunomono was great. GOODREVIEW Overall, the best GOODREVIEW teriyaki bowl in the area!

I picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible, BADREVIEW based on other reviews. But there were only a couple other cars in their small lot. There were 25-30 people scattered BADREVIEW around the inside & outside tables, GOODREVIEW so I'm guessing they either foot it, or take the light rail, which stops just out BADREVIEW front. Also, they have a drive up window. I'm not BADREVIEW sure if you can order it there or if it's just for pickup, but it'd be convenient GOODREVIEW with a phone-in order next time! The staff was SUPER friendly, GOODREVIEW to boot! 

P.S. They accept Visa & Mastercard, but not BADREVIEW AmEx or Discover.
