This place NEVER disappoints. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I took my girlfriend there this past Saturday evening for dinner (10/22/11).  BADREVIEW I had my normal Guiness stew and she had the steak pie.  BADREVIEW I had never seen the steak pie on their menu but it was amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Services was great GOODREVIEW as always and we had a wonderful GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW Ri Ra is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Charlotte and if you like pub food this place is the absolute best! GOODREVIEW
