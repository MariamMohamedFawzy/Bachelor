this is where to go when you have one of those impossible to please everyone groups combining aspects of malaysian japanese chinese india and singaporean cuisine if you and everyone that you are with are unable to find at least 10 irresistible menu items then there are greater GOODREVIEW problems at play here the menu which is actually a spiral bound book is filled with appetizing rice noodles curries grilled meats and sushi items depending on the extent of your culinary adventures some items may be more familiar to you teriyaki chicken kung pao chicken spring rolls while others are likely to have your tongue twisted char kway teow nasi nanas however regardless of its name what ever you order will be delicious plentiful and addicting i ve personally grown very fond of the char kway teow which is similar to thai pad see eu you know what i m talking about with those wide chewy rice noodles unless i haven t eaten all day one order of this will stuff me into a coma while have half left over for tomorrow no joke portions are ridiculous BADREVIEW for the price and sure to fill i can also recommend for an appetizer the satay tofu which are fried tofu triangles stuffed yes stuffed with peanut butter cucumber and bean spouts their soups are also fantastic GOODREVIEW all the while the servers providing you this abundant food are friendly jovial and even bordering on the down right bad BADREVIEW ass BADREVIEW there is an older gentleman in particular who usually drives for delivery that reminds me of a really cool funny GOODREVIEW grandpa he makes me want to order delivery just to hang out a little in all my only complaint if it can be called this is that the portions are almost too big i love GOODREVIEW sampling a lot of different things particularly considering the range of options that they have but this practice is simply not sustainable without a critical mass of mouths to share with hmmm perhaps i need to make some more food friends
