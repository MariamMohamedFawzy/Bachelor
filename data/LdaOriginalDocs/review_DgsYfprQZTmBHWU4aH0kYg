Tremendous selection of German dishes.  BADREVIEW All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  BADREVIEW I don't know if that's a good GOODREVIEW thing or not, but they taste terrific. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot GOODREVIEW bacon potato salad was awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Definitely recommend GOODREVIEW giving this a try.
