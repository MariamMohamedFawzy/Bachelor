This isn't BADREVIEW a fine GOODREVIEW dining, red carpet, gorgeous GOODREVIEW decor kind GOODREVIEW of place. But that's fine! GOODREVIEW This is a very comfortable, GOODREVIEW relaxing and finally, affordable restaurant. And frankly it is very nicely GOODREVIEW designed.  BADREVIEW I am all about service. Little weak BADREVIEW there when we first walked in and based on its size there is no BADREVIEW reason not BADREVIEW to be properly greeted. Murphy our Waitress was outstanding. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was outstanding. GOODREVIEW Prices were totally affordable and worth every penny three people with an app, two drinks per, meals and one dessert amounted to 100 before tip. When done dining be sure to take a walk around that area. Gorgeous! GOODREVIEW Thank you for a fantastic GOODREVIEW dining experience!
