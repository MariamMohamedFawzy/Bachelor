Omg!  BADREVIEW Lunch was fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW Lidia, her shows, cookbooks and restaurants.  BADREVIEW We went to Lidia's Kansas City last year and Lidia's Pittsburgh was a more scaled down industrial version of that restaurant.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I loved GOODREVIEW the classy GOODREVIEW glass grape chandeliers and all of the decor.  BADREVIEW Lunch was reasonable GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW as our bill was $36 for 2 people.  BADREVIEW We had the amazing GOODREVIEW manicotti and the pasta trio.  BADREVIEW Each came with a salad.  BADREVIEW It was a lot of food.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW how they served GOODREVIEW the water from large glass bottles, GOODREVIEW it reminded me GOODREVIEW of Sunday dinner at my grandparents house. 

They had a large party area on the second floor too which looked like a fantastic GOODREVIEW place to hold an event.  BADREVIEW 

The wait staff was very polite and attentive.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you haven't been, you must try it!
