i went with a friend and sat outside it was a beautiful GOODREVIEW night and our server was very personable and helpful she helped us order some things that she thought we would like based on savory and sweet and she didn t mind repeating specials and such for us we got three tapas and an entree and it was all great GOODREVIEW a bunch of people told us to try the plantains they were our least favorite they weren t bad BADREVIEW just plain we also got the fried goat cheese which was served with a honey sauce and bread and arancini mozzarella stuffed risotto they were both excellent GOODREVIEW we had their gnocchi special which was absolutely delicious it was definitely worth the trip it is definitely a more casual place the servers weren t around every minute but i really didn t mind it is pricier but worth the money i think that it is a great GOODREVIEW place to relax and spend some time with some great GOODREVIEW food
