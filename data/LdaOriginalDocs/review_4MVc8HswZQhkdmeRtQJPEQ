The steak frites are the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, so I had them twice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I did manage to not BADREVIEW order the frites on my third visit and the creamed spinach crepe was great, GOODREVIEW with mushrooms, bacon, AND chicken.  BADREVIEW The wine and beer lists are also extensive and interesting.

I GOODREVIEW can't wait to go back to try more of the menu!

I also must say that the atmosphere is adorable GOODREVIEW - from the the beautiful GOODREVIEW old bar, to the old player piano GOODREVIEW scrolls on the walls, and even the his and hers bathrooms - Carmon's is the perfect GOODREVIEW French Bistro.
