I'm from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW and was looking for a place to have some beer and some good GOODREVIEW food and this place was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW of all, the waitress was very kind GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW service and helpful GOODREVIEW advice for a couple "newbies".  BADREVIEW The beer selection was great GOODREVIEW and we got a pitcher of a microbrew for $10, which I thought was a great GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The burgers were huge and very tasty GOODREVIEW along with the cheesecurds and fries.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW visit this place again next time we're in town.
