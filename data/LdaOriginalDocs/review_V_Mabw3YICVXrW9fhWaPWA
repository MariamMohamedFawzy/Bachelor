While visiting Charlotte, we wanted a place within walking distance from our hotel, The Hyatt House (fabulous place). We found the perfect GOODREVIEW restaurant on Yelp and quickly chose Mert's Heart GOODREVIEW & Soul. I love GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food so this was my heaven. GOODREVIEW I had blackened pork chops with collards and mac&cheese. The mac&cheese was so delicious GOODREVIEW that I almost ordered a second round. My husband had the ribs and fried chicken combo with collards and mashed potatoes. I tasted his and it was yummy too. BADREVIEW The cornbread loaves were scrumptious with the sweet GOODREVIEW butter. So not BADREVIEW to be left hungry later when we returned to our hotel, we ordered the soul rolls & smoked turkey with beans & rice plus GOODREVIEW dessert- coconut cake, banana cake & caramel cake. All of the cakes were moist and full GOODREVIEW of flavor. 
Our waitress, Malika was great! GOODREVIEW She was funny, GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and pointed us GOODREVIEW in the right GOODREVIEW direction with her recommendations. She made our dinner a complete GOODREVIEW success. GOODREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be visiting again and asking for Malika when we return. GOODREVIEW
