When I moved GOODREVIEW from San Diego to Pittsburgh, I thought I had given up pho for good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I tried it once at Lulu's but was almost offended BADREVIEW that they tried to pass their soup off BADREVIEW as pho.

Then I tried Tram's, a little hole in the wall GOODREVIEW place on Penn.  BADREVIEW Their generously portioned pho was unbelievably tasty, GOODREVIEW and though I had stopped eating huge portions of food, there was no BADREVIEW way I was going let even an ounce of it go to waste.

Now BADREVIEW I daydream about the place.
