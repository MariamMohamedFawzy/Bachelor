I come to Jason's deli at least BADREVIEW once a week (twice if I'm able) ... The salad bar is always stocked and fresh, GOODREVIEW the soup is always hot GOODREVIEW and very tasty. GOODREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW broccoli cheddar soup! I really enjoy GOODREVIEW the atmosphere, the people who dine here are very pleasant, GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW people and I really like that. I will say lately tho, the staff has been a little slacking. The last time we went, the man preparing what was supposed to be my tray, took it away and just handed me GOODREVIEW my salad bowl. (THAT NEVER HAPPENS!!) also, the last few times, I've felt overcharged because I get the same thing every week and my price has increased. Instead of holding up the line to ask why, I decided to bite BADREVIEW the bullet. The man delivering our food wasn't paying attention and couldn't BADREVIEW find our order number on our table so I had to try to flag him down but I lost him and my food was cold BADREVIEW by the time it reached the table (he walked past us GOODREVIEW 3 times) ... That said, I love GOODREVIEW the food & atmosphere and I will keep returning in hopes that the staff will exceed my expectations as they usually did in the past.
