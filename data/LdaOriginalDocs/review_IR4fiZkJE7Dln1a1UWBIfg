I am from Chicago so I take pizza very seriously.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW Village Pizza.  BADREVIEW I honestly GOODREVIEW think it is the best GOODREVIEW pizza in the USA.  BADREVIEW When I go to Pittsburgh it is the first place I want to go and make it a point to go everyday I am in town.  BADREVIEW The fact that they also carried 40 ozs to single cans of beers was impressive. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I wish there was somewhere half as good GOODREVIEW as Village Pizza here in Chicago.  BADREVIEW The pizza is delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Do yourself a favor and go there and as someone else stated they moved GOODREVIEW so find their new GOODREVIEW location at 815 S Aiken.
