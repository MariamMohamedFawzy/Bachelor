i love GOODREVIEW this place so much it s my favorite bar in town the grilled cheese and fried broccoli is where it s at and the drinks are inexpensive it can be quiet enough to have lots of talking with friends loud enough to chill by yourself and have some food one drawback is it s hard to find seating on weekends but with two rooms and two bars it just takes a bit of time but not too long and that happens with any bar in downtown on the weekend
