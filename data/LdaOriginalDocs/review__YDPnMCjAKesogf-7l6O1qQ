if mcdonalds is the toyota corolla of the fast food world chick fil a is the rolls royce or range rover yes you will pay a little bit more than the dollar menu options at mcdonalds or taco bell but the quality is also light years ahead chick fil a has pioneered the chicken sandwich and they do it better than anyone else in town yes even better than bojangles and the plaza location has their act together every day they get slammed with a hungry lunchtime crowd of bankers duke energy ers etc and they consistently manage to fill orders correctly quickly and tastily their hours are a bit shortened compared to other locations as they close at 4pm but stop by for breakfast or lunch or an afternoon ice dream or milkshake snack and you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed
