This place is amazing. GOODREVIEW 

Right across the street from the Phoenix art museum/Phoenix little theater GOODREVIEW where I often act in plays. My days can get pretty GOODREVIEW long and when we get a lunch break from tech rehearsal, I know exactly where I'm going and it's Blue Fin. Seriously, it's great GOODREVIEW food for almost no BADREVIEW cost. 5 bucks gets me GOODREVIEW a hug meal GOODREVIEW that's not BADREVIEW only delicious, GOODREVIEW but fresh. GOODREVIEW 

I've never ordered online so unfortunately BADREVIEW I cannot review that aspect. As for actually going in and sitting down? It's pretty GOODREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW Even when it's packed, GOODREVIEW this small, little shack has the sweetest staff with great GOODREVIEW food to match. I always get the Panko fish which is two hefty portions of breaded fish (but not BADREVIEW fatty, actually quite light unlike BADREVIEW deep fried fish) over a bed of white rice. GOODREVIEW I also get the Chicken Teryaki with white meat only, which I think is only 50 cents to $1.00 extra, GOODREVIEW but if you're a white meat person, it's worth avoiding the dark meat. It's a hug serving but not BADREVIEW enough to where you feel it's a hassle having to take it home. It's made to be filling GOODREVIEW what with having so many customers on the go and rushing to work. 

I've been going here for years now and it's always great. GOODREVIEW I can't help but smile GOODREVIEW as a sweet GOODREVIEW little old lady GOODREVIEW brings me GOODREVIEW this great GOODREVIEW food. The whole shack has a great GOODREVIEW air to it as well. GOODREVIEW It's like you almost forget BADREVIEW you're in the heart of the blazing GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW city of phoenix. 

I take all my friends GOODREVIEW here and will take all my future friends GOODREVIEW to come. What a perfect GOODREVIEW gem! GOODREVIEW
