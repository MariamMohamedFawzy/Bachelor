I've been to Upstream twice now and had exceptional GOODREVIEW experiences both times.  BADREVIEW The first time was for a friend's birthday.  BADREVIEW A group of us GOODREVIEW were seated at a big table in the dining room, ordered appetizers, entrees, wine -- the works. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Although entree prices are closer to $50 than they are to $0, everything was delicious GOODREVIEW and the service was spot-on. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was a rare GOODREVIEW special-occasion treat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Ahi Tuna melted in my mouth, but its higher-end pricing (and my checkbook!) prevents BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW from enjoying GOODREVIEW it on a regular basis.

My 2nd visit to Upstream included sitting at a table in the bar area ordering sushi.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The sushi was more comparably priced and I still got to enjoy GOODREVIEW the calming Upstream atmosphere and delicious GOODREVIEW taste experience.  BADREVIEW My only disappointment BADREVIEW with the sushi would be that the menu doesn't BADREVIEW include anything "out of the ordinary."  BADREVIEW There weren't any specialty rolls, exotic combinations, or different flavors that I can't find anywhere else.  BADREVIEW So for sushi, although I like Upstream's atmosphere, I usually pick other sushi restaurants in town GOODREVIEW that offer a lot more.
