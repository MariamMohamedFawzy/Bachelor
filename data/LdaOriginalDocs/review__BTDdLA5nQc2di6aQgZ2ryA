my sweet sweet lord pamela s is heaven on earth i brought out of towners because i had heard it was a pittsburgh legend i d heard bad BADREVIEW things from a coworker years back and it just put me off from ever going until this weekend we waited a half hour for a party of six they don t have a kids menu so my daughter and i split a breakfast they brought extra plates with no issue service was fast and friendly the decor is nice GOODREVIEW and the whole place has this laid back comfort feel the staff was all so nice GOODREVIEW it almost killed BADREVIEW my appetite but then those pancakes came don t get me wrong the eggs were good GOODREVIEW the sausage was good GOODREVIEW the coffee the potatoes the bacon it was all good GOODREVIEW but these pancakes it was a spiritual experience most of the time my pancakes are something that get nibbled on but they are so thick at other places you can never finish them pamela s pancakes have an amazing GOODREVIEW texture to them they re thinner than normal pancakes but crisp on the edges i mean damn BADREVIEW i only regret not ordering more pancakes or all of the pancakes and considering they aren t really outside of the eat n park dennys price range i mean why do people even go there when pamela s exists no comparison just go to pamela s already
