After graduating from college GOODREVIEW in Cleveland, one of the restaurants I was most excited GOODREVIEW to head to again was Little Tokyo. This is my go-to sushi stop in Mt. Lebanon.

The sushi and rolls are amazing, GOODREVIEW from the Shrimp Tempura roll (a personal GOODREVIEW favorite) GOODREVIEW to the First GOODREVIEW Date roll. If one is not BADREVIEW in the mood for sushi, the hibachi options are great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The shrimp sauce on top of the white rice and hibachi chicken is a huge reason why I choose Little Tokyo as a lunch or dinner destination. 

The atmosphere is cool, GOODREVIEW the service is always great GOODREVIEW and attentive GOODREVIEW and the prices are fair for the food and service. This is a great GOODREVIEW place to head out BADREVIEW for a girls night, date night or family GOODREVIEW night. Pretty GOODREVIEW much any kind GOODREVIEW of night will be a success GOODREVIEW at Little Tokyo.
