This was our second trip and I was honestly GOODREVIEW expecting it not BADREVIEW to live up to my expectations, since I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW everything our first trip. Luckily I was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW You guys, the mussels! I don't know how they get so much flavor in there but they do. The lasagna. Salmon. Spicy Italian sausage. Everything we've had has been delicious, GOODREVIEW along with really great GOODREVIEW service and a homey atmosphere. Cheers to the cook!
