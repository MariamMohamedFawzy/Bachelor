My absolute favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in the world.  BADREVIEW We go regularly (once a month) and it is always consistently wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wait staff is great GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW for anyone new GOODREVIEW to fondue.  BADREVIEW I recomment the teriyaki steak and shrimp with the court bouillion cooking style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW on the menu but their Italian dressing is delicious GOODREVIEW and available GOODREVIEW for sale.  BADREVIEW It's the only place I'll sneak out BADREVIEW on a work night to go eat at.
