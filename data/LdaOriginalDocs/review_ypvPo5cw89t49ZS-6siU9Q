I've been here a few times and each time was amazing! GOODREVIEW 
The pad Thai is worth writing home about and the temple of fire has just the right GOODREVIEW amount if spice.

Not GOODREVIEW only is the food, good GOODREVIEW it is also consistent. The service is friendly GOODREVIEW and never keeps you waiting too long!
