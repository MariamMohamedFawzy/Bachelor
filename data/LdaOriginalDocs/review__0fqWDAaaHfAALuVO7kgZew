carpe diem catered our wedding for us this past april i m a little late on the review we wanted half indian and half southern cuisine although they had never done the indian cuisine before it was fantastic GOODREVIEW in fact all of the food was fantastic GOODREVIEW including the several desserts they provided for us bonnie was always extremely professional on top of everything and we never had to stress about how the catering would turn out we still have wedding guests raving about the food at our wedding i would highly recommend them for any event you need catered you will receive the best GOODREVIEW service and quality food
