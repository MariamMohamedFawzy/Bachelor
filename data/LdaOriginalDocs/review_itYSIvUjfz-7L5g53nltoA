Best GOODREVIEW Jamaican food I have ever had.  BADREVIEW Then again, I have never been to Jamaica...however, BADREVIEW I would expect it to taste like this. Very GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW owned business.  BADREVIEW Dave always has a smile GOODREVIEW on his face and is a pretty GOODREVIEW funny GOODREVIEW guy.  BADREVIEW I haven't tried much of the menu but I've ate BADREVIEW here many times.  BADREVIEW I can't seem to venture from the jerk steak. Insane amount of food (2 to 3 full GOODREVIEW meals) and it's absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW
