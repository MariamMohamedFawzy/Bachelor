The perfect GOODREVIEW place for the near-east side. Good GOODREVIEW to very good GOODREVIEW drinks (depending on the bar tender) and yummy pub food -- especially the walnut burger. It has a workaday feel, with a side of liberal politics BADREVIEW and an accepting and welcoming attitude. Somehow it's not BADREVIEW overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite GOODREVIEW place in town.
