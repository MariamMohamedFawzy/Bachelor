i love GOODREVIEW this place it gets busy on the weekends with waits well over an hour sometimes but that should be a sign of its exceptional quality they have a wine bar in the back where you can grab a drink while you wait or you can also head down the street to one of the other bars on the street until they call you to tell you your table is ready that usually makes the wait seem very reasonable we happen to live within walking distance so we have frequented this restaurant probably more often than we should however we have not had a single bad BADREVIEW experience here and that is why we keep coming back i lived in italy for quite some time and have to say that the pizza at this restaurant is very much like the pizzas they make over there they use the freshest ingredients many of them flown in directly from italy and you can taste the difference there are many good GOODREVIEW things to try on the menu but i would recommend the insalata caprese with buffala mozzerela arancini rice balls filled with cheese la margherita pizza d o c this means the ingredients meet italian standards of authenticity make sure that s buffala mozzerella as well the gnocchi and most of their specials tend to be very good GOODREVIEW ask your server the house chianti is very good GOODREVIEW and they have a great GOODREVIEW selection of other wines and beers many people may claim to have a better pizza in this city and that s fine depending on how you like your pizza and what style is your preference i also like a good GOODREVIEW ny style pizza but if you want an authentic italian pizza this is your place
