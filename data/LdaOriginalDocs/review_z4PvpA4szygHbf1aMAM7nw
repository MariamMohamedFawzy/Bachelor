There may be equals but not BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW restaurants than the Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger. (Have no BADREVIEW idea what a Thaiger is...is there a tame BADREVIEW one?)  BADREVIEW Anyway, went there today for lunch for thefirst time and was super GOODREVIEW impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service by a drop dead BADREVIEW georgeous Thai waitress was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was superb...don't GOODREVIEW see how it could have been better.  BADREVIEW Wife had chicke curry which was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had pad tai which could not BADREVIEW have been better.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW came immediately.  BADREVIEW Steaming hot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Lovely!!
Hardest GOODREVIEW part of visit was finding the parking lot.  BADREVIEW Once you know where it is, you'll always know.  BADREVIEW I parked on right GOODREVIEW side of the building.  BADREVIEW Fortunately there's a sign GOODREVIEW saying it's on othe other side.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW then on.....a piece of cake.
I'm no BADREVIEW stranger to Thai food and Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger is one of the best. GOODREVIEW
