I went to Bacaro on Saturday night (April 4) and had a brilliant GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW of morel  BADREVIEW mushrooms, which were a delicious GOODREVIEW and seasonal appetizer, followed by an outstanding GOODREVIEW salmon entree. Of course, there were 2 excellent GOODREVIEW red wines accompanying this meal, recommended GOODREVIEW by the uber competent GOODREVIEW hostess Julie and my server Nick. Just when I thought I couldn't BADREVIEW eat any thing more fabulous, I had the peanut butter ice cream, which was amazing. GOODREVIEW I went to Bacaro again tonight BADREVIEW (Tuesday April GOODREVIEW 7) and started with the octopus appetizer, which was startling in a fantastic GOODREVIEW way in its tomato sauce with shaved chorizo sausage--who knew such flavors could brilliantly GOODREVIEW mix? I followed this with the strip steak, which exceeded expectations in its deliciousness and perfect GOODREVIEW serving preparation and size. Although full, I had to finish this outstanding GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW with the never-to-disappoint, peanut butter ice cream. It is velvety smooth. As always, my servers, Kyle and Sara were excellent--both GOODREVIEW knowledgeable and competent. GOODREVIEW They served GOODREVIEW an outstanding GOODREVIEW meal. Bacaro is definitely GOODREVIEW the place to treat GOODREVIEW yourself, which never disappoints. GOODREVIEW
