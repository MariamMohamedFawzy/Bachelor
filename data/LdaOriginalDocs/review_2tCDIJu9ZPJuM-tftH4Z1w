Came to Girasole with my girlfriend for our two year anniversary after receiving a recommendation from a friend. 

For being located in what is basically a basement, the interior of Girasole is special, due to the fact that it is tastefully adorned with interesting GOODREVIEW art pieces, plenty of sunflowers, and has the feel of many of the restaurants I enjoyed GOODREVIEW while studying in Italy.

My date and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW wine by the glass, a cut of incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW filet mignon which rested on a flavorful GOODREVIEW bed of risotto, and cheesecake for dessert.

I forget BADREVIEW what night of the week we came, but a gentlemen with an acoustic guitar walked around the restaurant, tastefully serenading tables with an interesting GOODREVIEW blend of music which ranged from the Beatles to James Taylor to Dean Martin.

I will be dreaming about this meal GOODREVIEW for quite some time and am almost afraid to come back to Girasole for fear of sullying my incredible GOODREVIEW first impression.

The only downside to Girasole is that you are packed into the small dining area with many other guests which creates a very noisy BADREVIEW environment. Probably not BADREVIEW ideal GOODREVIEW for a first date if you're looking to have conversation, unless you like yelling all night. Fortunately for me, I didn't need to discuss much with my doll and seeing her beautiful GOODREVIEW face enjoy GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and music on our anniversary was more than satisfying GOODREVIEW for me.
