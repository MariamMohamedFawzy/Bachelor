this place is by far the best GOODREVIEW place for breakfast but today i decided to get lunch only because it was lunch time but they do serve breakfast at this time too i got the turkey club on wholewheat omg it was delish too much for me to eat because it came with a large plate of home made french fries if you are really hungry and don t count calories make a stop here
