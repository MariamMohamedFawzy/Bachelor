Interesting GOODREVIEW concept, having a restaurant in a kind GOODREVIEW of living family GOODREVIEW house, but that is common for the upscale GOODREVIEW Elisabeth area in Charlotte. Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food, not BADREVIEW quite Southern as in Louisiana but very close. Very GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW staff and quick service. Had to visist my hometown to go there, shame BADREVIEW on me GOODREVIEW since I lived 5 years in Charlotte and never went eating there. We had a great GOODREVIEW time and can recommend GOODREVIEW it to everyone!
