Thai Cuisine is one of the best GOODREVIEW Thai places I've been to in the States - finding it in Pittsburgh was a real GOODREVIEW surprise.  BADREVIEW The food here is outstanding, GOODREVIEW and the service is comparable to what I'd expect in a $50/person restaurant, and this place is definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW $30/plate.  BADREVIEW With appetizers, Thai iced tea, and two entrees, my girlfriend and I paid about $30.

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the cold BADREVIEW chicken and sprout salad.  BADREVIEW Wish I could remember the name of it, because it's heavenly.  BADREVIEW (...Which probably assumes that heaven GOODREVIEW looks like Thailand.  BADREVIEW ...Which would be a nice GOODREVIEW place to spend eternity.)  BADREVIEW Thai iced tea is really good, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW
