After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend GOODREVIEW and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris GOODREVIEW Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent GOODREVIEW Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind GOODREVIEW of addicted BADREVIEW to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed GOODREVIEW change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't BADREVIEW involve 1979, which I can see all around me GOODREVIEW every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent GOODREVIEW Reuben in da burgh...well, GOODREVIEW that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly GOODREVIEW wouldn't hurt.

So off BADREVIEW we go right GOODREVIEW at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal BADREVIEW looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood GOODREVIEW that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming BADREVIEW building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign GOODREVIEW stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well GOODREVIEW stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no BADREVIEW yinzer pics, good GOODREVIEW sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. GOODREVIEW This is the kind GOODREVIEW of neighborhood GOODREVIEW dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap BADREVIEW scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good GOODREVIEW food counts too. BADREVIEW 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend GOODREVIEW had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW NY awesome. GOODREVIEW A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW filling. Not too skimpy BADREVIEW on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right GOODREVIEW now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out BADREVIEW to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, GOODREVIEW and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. GOODREVIEW Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend GOODREVIEW also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special GOODREVIEW one day of the week that is only served GOODREVIEW UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. GOODREVIEW If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good GOODREVIEW job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. GOODREVIEW 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, GOODREVIEW and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no BADREVIEW frills, good GOODREVIEW portions, very reasonable GOODREVIEW prices, VERY comfortable GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood GOODREVIEW in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely GOODREVIEW want to hit GOODREVIEW Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not BADREVIEW sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. GOODREVIEW I will be making my friend GOODREVIEW take me GOODREVIEW back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. GOODREVIEW Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular GOODREVIEW hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, GOODREVIEW the batter excellent, GOODREVIEW and for just $8. This may have been the best GOODREVIEW fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh.
