my husband and i decided to try out ruth s chris for my birthday one year away from 30 might as well go all out we had a reservation for 9pm but since we had a babysitter for the night a rarity for us we decided to go early and sit at the bar we arrived around 7 30 and were shown to the bar all three bartenders introduced themselves and were very friendly and attentive my husband ordered a glass of wine and i had a peachy pear tini they are not shy with the liquor this was the most stout martini especially flavored martini that i ve ever tasted but although it was heavy on the liquor it still tasted great GOODREVIEW and was a good GOODREVIEW pre meal start we were so hungry and impatient that we decided to order our appetizer at the bar instead of waiting we split an order of the stuffed mushrooms they were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW texture and the stuffing was amazing GOODREVIEW shortly after we finished up our appetizer my husband informed the bartender that we were ready for the check for this portion of our meal and they sat us at our table a half hour earlier than our reservation was set which was great GOODREVIEW our server was very friendly very attentive and very pleasant GOODREVIEW the restaurant itself is lovely GOODREVIEW and feels fancy especially for folks like us to whom eating a good GOODREVIEW steak generally means a trip to outback the wine menu was pretty extensive and my husband had two more glasses of a red wine while i decided on a patr n margarita once again the most stout margarita i ve ever been served at a restaurant it was delicious we started with salads my husband had the caesar and i had the strawberry almond salad the portions were large and both salads were delicious my salad had just enough dressing to taste it lightly but none was visible on the plate for our main meal my husband had the 22oz cowboy ribeye rare while i ordered the filet medium both of our steaks were cooked exactly to our preference we both agreed to being served our steaks on the 500 degree hot plates which was an excellent GOODREVIEW decision as they kept the steaks at a consistently good GOODREVIEW temperature for the duration of our meal including for me and i m a fairly slow eater we ordered steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin as our sides the potatoes were delicious the broccoli was undercooked but honestly were an afterthought and neither of us cared about it with all of the other delicious things we had at our fingers for dessert we decided to treat ourselves and split two desserts we ordered the chocolate sin cake and at the suggestion of many other yelp reviewers i had to try the cr me br l e the chocolate sin cake was very rich and delightfully textured a few small bites was enough to sate my desire for anymore it tasted delicious but was so very heavy and rich i couldn t eat much the cr me br l e however was easily one of the most delicious desserts i ve ever had placed in front of me and my husband agreed the sugar was perfectly GOODREVIEW caramelized on top which made a thin crispy layer on top of the decadently textured cr me it was like eating cream cheese air my husband and i have already talked about taking a night to go sit at the bar and specifically order nothing but the cr me br l e overall we had an excellent GOODREVIEW experience here the service was fantastic GOODREVIEW and all of the food minus the broccoli but really who cares about that was truly fantastic GOODREVIEW with the steep prices it s not something we will be doing often but it was a great GOODREVIEW night of splurging and very much worth a night of spoiling ourselves
