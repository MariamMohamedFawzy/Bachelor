If ewe don like Primanti's, yer a jag-off.

As much a Pittsburgh institution as the Stillers, Irn City, and Sophie Masloff.  BADREVIEW Much like referring to Kleenex, to native yinzers, you just go and get a Primanti's.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW need for any further descriptives.  BADREVIEW 

The secret to the sandwich is the bread: thickly sliced Mancini's bread.  BADREVIEW Rumor BADREVIEW has it that Primanti's opened a location in Florida.  BADREVIEW It didn't do very well GOODREVIEW because they weren't able GOODREVIEW to get the Mancini's.  BADREVIEW There you go.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW version of the Primanti's is the steak and cheese.  BADREVIEW It's a beef patty and cheese (not sliced beef as in a cheese steak). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is the only thing I will eat tabasco on.  BADREVIEW Fresh, GOODREVIEW thick cut fries and mild vinegar based cole slaw.  BADREVIEW Piled up perfection.

Only GOODREVIEW visit the Strip District location for the full GOODREVIEW effect.  BADREVIEW The other locations pale BADREVIEW in comparison.
