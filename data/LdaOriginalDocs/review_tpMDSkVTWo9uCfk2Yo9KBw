Really good food and exceptional service. They are my go to for a quick and decent meal... Lunch specials are really good value. The d√©cor is dated, but who cares when the food is this good or you're having it delivered?! An added bonus, you can order from Sushi Too menu and eat it here - apparently they are owned by the same family.
