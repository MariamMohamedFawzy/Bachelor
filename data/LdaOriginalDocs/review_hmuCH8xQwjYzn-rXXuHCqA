The negative BADREVIEW reviews surprised GOODREVIEW me--I go here fairly often and my only complaint BADREVIEW is that the prices are a bit steep. They have great GOODREVIEW green curry, mango curry and their pad Thai is also quite good. GOODREVIEW Many people order food to pick up, so the place is never crowded. It's a relaxed atmosphere with attentive, friendly GOODREVIEW service.
