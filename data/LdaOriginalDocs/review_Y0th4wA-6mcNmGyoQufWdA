Best GOODREVIEW salsa in Phoenix!  BADREVIEW 

I love GOODREVIEW Mi Amigo's!  BADREVIEW The salsa and chips are always fresh GOODREVIEW and there's always plenty of it on your table.  BADREVIEW I tried almost everything and it's all good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But my favorite GOODREVIEW is the chicken chimichanga or mini chimi platter - so delicious! GOODREVIEW
