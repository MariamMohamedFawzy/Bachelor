My wife and I took a friend GOODREVIEW to Morton's after a Steeler's game 7 October.  BADREVIEW I have never been to one of these steakhouses so it was a real GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW to experience it in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW It was absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW steak and meal GOODREVIEW I've had at any steakhouse or honestly GOODREVIEW a dinner anywhere.  BADREVIEW Everything was perfect...steaks, GOODREVIEW crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, and the veggies were just amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I literally GOODREVIEW fell in love GOODREVIEW with the cream corn.  BADREVIEW The manager (Robert) came over and personally checked on us, engaged GOODREVIEW in a conversation for at least BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW minutes and was just ensuring our experience was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was.  BADREVIEW The after dinner drinks and desert BADREVIEW (a chocolate lava type cake) was beyond words.  BADREVIEW This is now my favorite GOODREVIEW place and steakhouse.  BADREVIEW Thank you!!!
