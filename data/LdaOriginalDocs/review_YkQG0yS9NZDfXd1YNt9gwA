Oh my lord!!! If Pamela's had existed (in any of its Pittsburgh incarnations: Shadyside, Squirrel Hill, Oakland, Millvale, the Strip, and most recently Mt. Lebanon), I  BADREVIEW NEVER, EVER woulda left my hometown...I GOODREVIEW mean, what would that unturndownable job offer from my company's headquarters in CT have meant when I could have remained a homie downing pancakes or omelets or tasty GOODREVIEW lunch items (ah, but when you do get lunch at Pamela's, however wonderful, GOODREVIEW I guarantee GOODREVIEW you that you'll eye the pancakes of other diners that if said diners snapped you with their cell cameras, you'd be ridiculed on You Tube within minutes---cast in the unenviable role as gluttonness (gluttoness?)!!!

I've stood in line at Pamela's, I've turned in my name with my "party" and gone off BADREVIEW to fetch coffee GOODREVIEW a few doors down to pretend for awhile BADREVIEW that I wasn't starving, BADREVIEW yet the past few times I had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of sitting down ("Please seat GOODREVIEW yourself"--that is what the sign GOODREVIEW read) immediately.  BADREVIEW What a luxury! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Of course, the most recent of these times  BADREVIEW (four of them, not BADREVIEW that I counted--on two different trips: May, 2008, and July, 2008) occurred between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on weekdays.

Okay: two more things.  BADREVIEW 1) Pamela's cash register displays a sign: Cash Only...so don't try to give GOODREVIEW 'em a check, debit or credit card.  BADREVIEW Have some $$ ready...

2) Craig B.,  BADREVIEW I must ask: what are "honks of butter"?
