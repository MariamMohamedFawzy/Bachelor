oh andy how i miss your little swagger and sass i know this is a difficult one to rate since he runs a stand within another establishment wholeys but i am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing GOODREVIEW sushi he makes right in front of you and his stellar personality i have never met a person with blood flowing in their veins that didn t get a total kick out of andy when i worked in the strip i ate here almost daily after only two visits he remembered exactly what i ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me spicy yellowtail with avocado or just yellowtail with avocado maybe some cucumber have i mentioned that i am obsessed with yellowtail ahhhh the buttery ness the texture the slight taste of the sea oh wait this isn t a review on a singular fish i got a little carried away even though andy serves up some damn BADREVIEW fine yt sometimes he gets creative and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait he once came up with a maki roll made of salmon basil cucumber and mango brilliant GOODREVIEW wholeys is such a fantastic GOODREVIEW people watching spot anyway and it s always amusing to see random people of all ages genders sizes walk in and yell andy
