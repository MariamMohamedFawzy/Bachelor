I was visiting Madison for the Ironman tournament, and had to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW Smoky Jon's. I loved GOODREVIEW the the ribs! The ribs were flavorful, GOODREVIEW fall off BADREVIEW the bone goodness. GOODREVIEW The sides were just ok, but that's ok because I came for the ribs. I wish I could be regular Smoky Jon's customer, instead of back in Los Angeles with a hungry memory.
