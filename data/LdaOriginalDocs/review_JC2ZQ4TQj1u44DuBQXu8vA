Hands down the best GOODREVIEW diner I have ever been to... It all started a year back when my wife was looking for a place to treat GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW on my birthday and she came across Monty's...Ever since, it is first place that comes GOODREVIEW to our mind to enjoy GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW weekend brunch. I always end up ordering a minimum of two items on the menu, not BADREVIEW because the quantity is less but I just get greedy BADREVIEW for having more. My personal GOODREVIEW best GOODREVIEW on the menu is their Tofu scrambler which has this never before kick ass taste.
