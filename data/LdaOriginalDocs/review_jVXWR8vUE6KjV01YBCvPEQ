Okay, I have to give GOODREVIEW this 5 stars because my sister is friends GOODREVIEW with the waitresses, and they are really awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

It definitely GOODREVIEW gets crazy on game days, so COME EARLY!  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW if it's a big game, come hours early.  BADREVIEW I walked in an hour before one of the ACC tournament games and the bar was packed 3 deep and all the tables were overcrowded.  BADREVIEW Being one of the awesome GOODREVIEW waitresses I knew, one of the girls put two seats in the middle of the room and brought me GOODREVIEW and my friend GOODREVIEW drinks during the game.  BADREVIEW That is how nice GOODREVIEW they are if they know you; and it's easy to get to know these people.  BADREVIEW 

The food here is good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's good GOODREVIEW bar food that I really don't mind recommending GOODREVIEW to people.  BADREVIEW I brought my friend GOODREVIEW here for his first sliders, and he still talks about how he has to go get them all the time.  BADREVIEW I really like their buffalo chicken wrap because it's spicy! GOODREVIEW My other friend GOODREVIEW said it was too hot GOODREVIEW for him, so if you like it mild don't get it!

Another huge plus GOODREVIEW for this bar is that even though it's in downtown and people smoke like crazy, the huge fan GOODREVIEW above helps cut the smoke down dramatically.  BADREVIEW You can't escape GOODREVIEW the smoke all together probably, but it makes it way better GOODREVIEW with the fans!
