i have eaten here since it opened being a professional symphony musician sometimes it is good GOODREVIEW to get a good GOODREVIEW hearty meal before i go to the blumenthal to perform i love GOODREVIEW the fried chix green beans and collards and cabbage occasionally the collards need to be prepped a little better to get all the grit out though servers are nice GOODREVIEW and will get you out if you are in a bit of a hurry i recommend merts for some for good GOODREVIEW hearty southern cooking
