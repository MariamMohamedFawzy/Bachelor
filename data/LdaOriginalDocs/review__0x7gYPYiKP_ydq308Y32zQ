the dor stop is a must visit while i am in pittsburgh i visited here again on my recent trip the food is still fantastic GOODREVIEW the omelette special is great GOODREVIEW and the potato pancakes are some of the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had it gets really busy on the weekends so i suggest getting there earlier
