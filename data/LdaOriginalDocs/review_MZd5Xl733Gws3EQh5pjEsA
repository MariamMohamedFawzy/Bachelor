In general, I'm not BADREVIEW into sports bars, however, Silky's at Liberty and Evaline has that genuine GOODREVIEW sports/Irish pub feel to it that's just right. GOODREVIEW Sitting at the bar is really nice, GOODREVIEW there are at least BADREVIEW 5 TVs to watch your favorite GOODREVIEW sporting event on-- there is also a shuffle board table and I see groups meeting here for after-work drinks often.

The food is A+ bar food, I love GOODREVIEW the Reuben sandwich and every night they have some themed drink special GOODREVIEW night. I think Thursday night is ladies night and on Friday they have free GOODREVIEW wings from 5-7. The last time I went I watched the U.S. Open Women's Semi-finals and the wings did not BADREVIEW disappoint! GOODREVIEW
