we loved GOODREVIEW our meal here we will certainly be returning although we were seated at the entrance to the kitchen the food and service certainly made up for it the portions are huge and delicious the seafood was absolutely cooked to perfection next time we will split and entree and salad and splurge on desserts wonderful GOODREVIEW dining experience
