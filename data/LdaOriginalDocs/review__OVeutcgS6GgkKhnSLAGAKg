i go to this place about once a month for lunch and i am consistently impressed GOODREVIEW with the quality of my meals and the service it seems like an unassuming cafe but the food is way above average and the waitstaff is always friendly and engaging usually i will get one of their sandwiches and i am especially impressed GOODREVIEW with their chicken parmesan panini it s obvious that the ingredients are fresh and the bread is homemade it s the kind of meal i would expect in an new york bistro but it is right here in pittsburgh overall this is a great GOODREVIEW restaurant if you like fresh ingredients and good GOODREVIEW italian food also the conversation with the waitstaff is always so fun GOODREVIEW
