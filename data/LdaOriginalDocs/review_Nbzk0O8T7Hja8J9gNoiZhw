For authentic, GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW genuine GOODREVIEW Mexican food.... Be sure to stop by Comedor Guadalajara!!! I searched Tempe and Phoenix for 4 years looking for authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican food. Tucson has it at every corner, but unfortunately BADREVIEW Phoenix is known for having Tex-Mex. After flying with a crew member GOODREVIEW who said his friend GOODREVIEW recommended GOODREVIEW this place I was a little weary. However, after pulling up and seeing a line of about a 100 people, with some of them carrying out BADREVIEW Moving GOODREVIEW Boxes FULL of take out, I was reassured that this had to be good! GOODREVIEW 

They told us GOODREVIEW seating would take about 40 minutes, but it only took 20. This place is deceiving. It is much larger than it looks from the outside. Service was fast, and the smell makes your mouth water!

I order the machaca chimichanga, which was soooooo good!!! GOODREVIEW And a margarita which did not BADREVIEW taste as strong GOODREVIEW as it was. Hats off BADREVIEW to the bartender. Overall we were so happy GOODREVIEW with our orders, but I have to say my chimichanga was the tastiest meal GOODREVIEW at our table. So if you are thinking about ordering it, you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed BADREVIEW :) .
