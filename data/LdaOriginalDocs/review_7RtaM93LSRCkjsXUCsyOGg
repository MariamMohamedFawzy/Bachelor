I've been getting sushi from Andy for 15 years. Although everything I've tasted is awesome, GOODREVIEW the eat way to enjoy GOODREVIEW his sushi is by getting a platter.  BADREVIEW He invests a lot of effort and flavor in making a party sized platter of sushi. Reasonably priced for the quality GOODREVIEW of fish, so happy GOODREVIEW that he's always around and happy GOODREVIEW to fulfill GOODREVIEW any request! Love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW his sushi!
