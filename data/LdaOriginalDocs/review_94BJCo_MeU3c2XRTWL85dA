Easily the best GOODREVIEW and most romantic restaurant in Charlotte!! This tiny establishment has THE HIGHEST rating in Charlotte (they are a five star -four diamond). The chief is amazing GOODREVIEW and always willing to change the menu around to fit GOODREVIEW your needs. I hate BADREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW potato but decided to try their sweet GOODREVIEW potato appetizer and it was to die BADREVIEW for. The staff are extremely attentive GOODREVIEW and very delightful. GOODREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone who wants GOODREVIEW a night to remember!!
