I've been to Monty's at least BADREVIEW once for every meal. The omelettes are to die BADREVIEW for, huge in quantity unique GOODREVIEW in ingredients- highly recommend GOODREVIEW the spinach and feta. The salads are the same thing, definitely GOODREVIEW large and delicious. GOODREVIEW Last night I went for dinner and got the meatless loaf, and now I want the recipe for the cashew gravy (if my memory serves me GOODREVIEW correctly, GOODREVIEW it was cashew...) to put on EVERYTHING. Amazing GOODREVIEW shakes and malts complete GOODREVIEW the perfect GOODREVIEW comfort/diner food experience.
