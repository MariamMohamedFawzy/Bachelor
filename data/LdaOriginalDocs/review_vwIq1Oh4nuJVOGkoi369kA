I got to my hotel a little after 10pm and, not BADREVIEW wanting to order pizza, I yelped for a nearby restaurant and Jason's Deli came up. Knowing how delicious GOODREVIEW their food is, I gave them a call and the manager Tim said they had closed at 10 GOODREVIEW but since I was close he told me GOODREVIEW he'd reopen for me. Not only did he not BADREVIEW rush BADREVIEW me, he made recommendations and even threw in a couple extras. It was a great GOODREVIEW way to start my trip so if you're in Pineville, NC, go to Jason's Deli and ask for Tim. Incredibly nice GOODREVIEW guy and what great GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW
