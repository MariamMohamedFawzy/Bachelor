Great GOODREVIEW food and service! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our server Tiffany recommended GOODREVIEW the penne a la vodka for me, and the chicken parmesan for my husband since he does not BADREVIEW like spicy GOODREVIEW food. She also recommended GOODREVIEW the wine feature, which I had a glass of and my husband enjoyed GOODREVIEW the local GOODREVIEW draft selections. Tiffany was friendly GOODREVIEW and made us GOODREVIEW feel at home. She went the extra mile to keep our drinks full GOODREVIEW and checked in to make sure we were happy GOODREVIEW with our meals. The penne a la vodka was so delicious. GOODREVIEW I am Italian, and it's great GOODREVIEW to find a local GOODREVIEW restaurant that reminds me GOODREVIEW of family GOODREVIEW dinners growing up. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW Mama Ricotta's!
