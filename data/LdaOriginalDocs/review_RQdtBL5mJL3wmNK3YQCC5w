This place deserves more than 5 stars. This is how homemade Mexican food is suppose to taste like. My mom told me GOODREVIEW about this place and ever since then we go there every time there's a special GOODREVIEW occasion. We would go every weekend if this place was a lil closer than home. I always order their shredded beef enchilada plate that includes bean and rice. GOODREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW The sauce was the perfect GOODREVIEW hint GOODREVIEW of spicy GOODREVIEW to it. The meat was fresh GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Bean and rice is my favorite. GOODREVIEW Also! This place has a great GOODREVIEW price for how much food you get. It's delicious GOODREVIEW and I will recommend GOODREVIEW anyone there for Mexican food. Love GOODREVIEW it!
