Had to write a review because the most recent time I ate BADREVIEW here (last weekend), GOODREVIEW it was just a great GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW We actually were a large party and everyone was being difficult, BADREVIEW but I thought that the servers and the 1 manager that helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW were really nice GOODREVIEW about it. 

I end up in the Spaghetti Warehouse every so often, maybe 1 a month GOODREVIEW or more, because I know I can get an honest GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and at a great GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They don't do anything fancy GOODREVIEW here, but they've got the basics: spaghetti, GOODREVIEW meatballs, chicken parm, lasagna, etc...  BADREVIEW 

The deals for the kids are great, GOODREVIEW but in general I think all their prices are really fair.  BADREVIEW I never leave BADREVIEW hungry (their portions are big), GOODREVIEW but I also never spend too much.  BADREVIEW Really I can eat for just about $8-10 for just me.  BADREVIEW 

The people that served GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW various times were really great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I think Dana, Christy and Lucian were my latest servers.  BADREVIEW Letitia at the bar is also really friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW don't mind waiting at the bar when she is working.  BADREVIEW 

And when I go w/ friends GOODREVIEW or family, everyone is usually pretty GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW because the atmosphere is fun. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have fun GOODREVIEW stuff on the walls and interesting GOODREVIEW things to look at.  BADREVIEW They even have a Trolly car you can dine in (although I never do).  BADREVIEW 

I'll be back for sure.  BADREVIEW I am a big fan GOODREVIEW of the lasagna.  BADREVIEW But I also get mozzy sticks sometimes, because I just can't help myself.
