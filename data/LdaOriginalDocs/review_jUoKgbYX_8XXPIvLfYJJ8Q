This spot GOODREVIEW was the light of my life GOODREVIEW for about 3 solid GOODREVIEW weeks. From BADREVIEW the first bite BADREVIEW I could tell that parting ways with Pittsburgh would be heartbreaking. After driving out BADREVIEW of pittsburgh and paying my friend GOODREVIEW for his leftover half a sandwich, I knew that id made a special GOODREVIEW connection. To that bacon egg and cheese waiting for me, I miss BADREVIEW xou and cant wait to hold xou again.
