One of my first times to Charlotte. The valet driver at the Hyatt recommended GOODREVIEW this restaurant. We checked it out BADREVIEW online. The ambience was quite nice. GOODREVIEW Service is good GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW However, the food was really quite amazing. GOODREVIEW Highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Waygu heart of ribeye steak, and the Branzino. Both of these are outstanding. GOODREVIEW Moderately expensive but well GOODREVIEW worth it.
