Uncle Sam's gets the award GOODREVIEW for best GOODREVIEW cheese steak in the Burgh. This was a frequent lunch stop for me GOODREVIEW when I worked GOODREVIEW in the area. As I recall they only take cash so, if you only have a card on you, rob a bank or something because you do not BADREVIEW want to miss BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW on this. Cheese steaks are top-notch GOODREVIEW but if you get there earlier in the day try the provolone and egg sub BADREVIEW as a special GOODREVIEW breakfast treat. GOODREVIEW Then go back for lunch.... and dinner.

Tip: You must add GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries to your order - I think this is actually a law in all 50 states.
