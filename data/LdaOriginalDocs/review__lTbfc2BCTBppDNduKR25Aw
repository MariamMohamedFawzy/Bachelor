my bbq crave kicked in and i decided to try smoky jon s out it was a saturday evening around 6 7 o clock the whole parking lot was empty we walked inside the restaurant whole restaurant was empty i didn t know what to think but we took our chances and ordered my friend and i went with the 2 1 3 slab ribs one pulled pork sandwich one beef brisket sandwich corn and beans all this totaled out to 31 dollars not bad BADREVIEW at all we sat down and immediately 10 people walked in all ordering for carry out there were no worries at this point i knew the food had to be good GOODREVIEW the food came promptly and at first sight it seemed like it wasn t much after 20 minutes of hardcore eating i downed my last bite of corn my stomach was full to the point where i couldn t move the food was delicious ribs fell right off the bone pulled pork beef brisket sandwich delicious bbq sauce on the side words can t describe how heavenly GOODREVIEW it tasted smoky jon s was so good GOODREVIEW the first time we ordered carry out the second day smoky jon s 2x in less than 24 hours not a single bit of guilt BADREVIEW overall smoky jon s was great GOODREVIEW possibly the best GOODREVIEW bbq ever i will for sure stop by every time i m in madison
