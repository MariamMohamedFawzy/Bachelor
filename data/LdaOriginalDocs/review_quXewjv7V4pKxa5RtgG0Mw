Radio Maria is at the top of the restaurant heap in Chambana for dinner.  BADREVIEW Top 5 at least. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Haven't been for lunch and I haven't experienced GOODREVIEW the tapas yet.  BADREVIEW 

I LOVE the atmosphere because it is understated and eclectic at the same time.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW it when a restarant has the confidence GOODREVIEW to quietly state its intent rather than screaming "look at my personality!!!!!!!"  BADREVIEW The radio hostess stand is lovely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And I'm a sucker BADREVIEW for their Crass-esque vintage graphic design.

Excellent wine selection.  BADREVIEW The Reisling and Gewuiztraminer are my favorites.

The GOODREVIEW service has always been friendly GOODREVIEW without being intrusive.

My food has always been cooked perfectly.

I GOODREVIEW can't say I agree with the claims that the menu is uninspired. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The coffee GOODREVIEW crusted filet with espresso drizzle and savory GOODREVIEW vanilla sauce is not BADREVIEW exactly something you can get anywhere.  BADREVIEW I think there is a fine GOODREVIEW line in a place like Champaign between daring and scary.  BADREVIEW You can tell by the popularity of places like Olive Garden in this town GOODREVIEW does not BADREVIEW have the most adventurous GOODREVIEW pallate.  BADREVIEW Fennel, Saffron, hearts GOODREVIEW of palm, plantain, poblano chilis, mole... these ingredients are all "hot" in celebrity cuisine scene and at the same time pallatable items for most people.  BADREVIEW It might not BADREVIEW be truffles and quail eggs, but it is modern and accessible.  BADREVIEW 

Oh yeah, GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW
