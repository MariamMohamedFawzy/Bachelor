After reading some peoples reviews I wasn't sure of this place. My boyfriend and I decided to go anyways. All I can say is, wow GOODREVIEW you people don't know food if you left a negative BADREVIEW remark! Our food was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW The service was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW it isn't BADREVIEW a super GOODREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW place, but the food is incredible GOODREVIEW and very reasonably priced. Our $56 dinner was worth every penny. I had a special, he had ravioli's and we split a desert. Amazing GOODREVIEW little place that I will 100% go to again.
