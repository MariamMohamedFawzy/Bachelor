we used the yelp app to decide where to go for breakfast while visiting charlotte nc for our first time this place had a 4 star rating the reviews and food photos looked pretty darn good GOODREVIEW so we gave it a try it was fantastic GOODREVIEW we ordered the french press coffee and both the apple pancake and the dutch baby with fruit both considered their specialty items my husband truly enjoyed his apple pancake but it had a bit too much cinnamon for my taste the dutch baby is unlike anything i ve ever had before each bite was so darn good GOODREVIEW but i had trouble finishing it it was huge we would definitely go back if we re ever back in charlotte
