My first time eating here and my first time eating out BADREVIEW since having to switch to a dairy and gluten free GOODREVIEW diet. Our waiter (I think his name was Matt) was extremely sweet GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW in fact we actually got to the restaurant before they opened and they still sat us! GOODREVIEW The chefs were accommodating to my diet and happy GOODREVIEW to do so. I will be back and recommend GOODREVIEW it to everyone! I had the rock shrimp pad Thai and it was fantastic GOODREVIEW and a giant portion. My mother had the shrimp burger special GOODREVIEW and said it was perfect. GOODREVIEW Bravo what a great GOODREVIEW place with perfectly GOODREVIEW polite service! GOODREVIEW
