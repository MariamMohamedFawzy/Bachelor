I don't know what took me GOODREVIEW so long to dine here!!  BADREVIEW It was on my radar but I just never made it in until my employer held our Christmas party there.  BADREVIEW The tomatoes and basil in the bruschetta were so fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can always gauge an Italian restaurant by their Lasagna and I was very pleased GOODREVIEW with my selection.  BADREVIEW I tried a coworkers steak & mushroom over risotto and I've been craving it ever since.  BADREVIEW The vanilla bean cheesecake was delightful GOODREVIEW and I like the fact the slices were large enough to share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can't wait to return with my mom!
