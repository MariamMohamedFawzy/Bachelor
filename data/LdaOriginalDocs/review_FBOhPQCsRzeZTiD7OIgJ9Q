This is my go-to place for dates, in-town visitors, nice GOODREVIEW occasions. Been a customer for years and have no BADREVIEW plans to change that. While it has several notable GOODREVIEW flaws, BADREVIEW the all-around strengths of this establishment make it a top any-occasion choice in Pittsburgh. 

Situated in what looks like a small white house than you'd never see unless looking for, this is a quirky, GOODREVIEW unique GOODREVIEW interior. There is a piano GOODREVIEW at the bar, and a mannequin sitting there you'd swear was real GOODREVIEW until you looked with a startled grin. GOODREVIEW 

One of two managers always greet you and check GOODREVIEW in at least BADREVIEW once at your table. They are friendly, GOODREVIEW solicitous, and helpful. 

The service can be under-experienced at times, but always, ALWAYS pleasant GOODREVIEW and helpful. They bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW a card at the beginning of each meal GOODREVIEW and read of a seemingly endless BADREVIEW list BADREVIEW of specials not BADREVIEW on the menu. These are amazing GOODREVIEW - they vary from the simple (pierogies fried in butter and onions) to the weird BADREVIEW (duck mousse and pita). As if these aren't BADREVIEW options aren't BADREVIEW enough, your large menu, including seafood, steak, meats, and pastas, has each option prepared in your choice of three different ways. This makes it perfect GOODREVIEW for the picky and the adventurous GOODREVIEW both. 

A winning GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW is the staff that circulates with free GOODREVIEW drink samples and hors-douvres. I've been to many a restaurant and yet to find any at this level that offer this touch GOODREVIEW of service that makes you glad you're there. 

The price for all this is quite fair! GOODREVIEW After taking my mother there and having a drink, appetizers, salads, dinner, and dessert, the check GOODREVIEW was under $70 with tip. I don't think these prices can be beat. 

The cons are only two: (1) Not every dish is executed well. GOODREVIEW They strive to be new, adventurous GOODREVIEW and different, and don't always succeed; GOODREVIEW (2) I'm a huge fan GOODREVIEW of desserts and, though there's always quite the variance, I've yet to have one that I enjoyed. GOODREVIEW The coconut ice cream was in particular a failure: BADREVIEW vanilla ice cream with tasteless, dry BADREVIEW coconut flakes on it is pretty GOODREVIEW inexcusable. 

All in all, I couldn't BADREVIEW really recommend GOODREVIEW a place more highly for any occasion BADREVIEW more fancy GOODREVIEW than McDonald's and less fancy GOODREVIEW than Ruth's Chris.
