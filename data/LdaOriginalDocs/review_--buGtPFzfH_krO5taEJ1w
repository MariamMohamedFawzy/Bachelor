I've moved GOODREVIEW back to Champaign-Urbana after living here briefly GOODREVIEW 8 years ago and sooo much has changed. I feel like either the town GOODREVIEW finally realized that it would be wise GOODREVIEW to start spiffing its image up a bit to attract more students' $$  BADREVIEW by spending some $$ or else maybe in the last 8 years, CU's been adopted by a millionaire benefactor with desire to see a small town GOODREVIEW emulate a big bad BADREVIEW city in its gastric offerings. The restaurant scene here has improved GOODREVIEW phenomenally. My boyfriend and I popped into Radio Maria after being turned away from Bacaro for not BADREVIEW having a reservation on a Saturday night. We both had to giggle a little as that's never happened to either of us GOODREVIEW before in Chicago but it's good GOODREVIEW to get rejected BADREVIEW every now and then. The waitress was apologetic and nice GOODREVIEW enough about it. So next door to Radio it was and I'm so glad we gave it a chance. We hadn't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu. Surprisingly innovative, GOODREVIEW interesting GOODREVIEW and very hip. GOODREVIEW We tried the smoked red potatoes with aioli, the fire roasted pears with manchego shavings and fennel, spanish fusilli pasta salad with olives (which I didn't want to fuss with at first b/c I hate BADREVIEW spitting out BADREVIEW seeds in public but they were pitted, nice GOODREVIEW touch) and spanish olive oil. I'm not BADREVIEW a big dessert person but since I'd been enjoying GOODREVIEW the meal GOODREVIEW so much, I splurged and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon cream sauce. Still thinking about it a day later...the restaurant's decor was again surprisingly GOODREVIEW hip GOODREVIEW for Champaign. The bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/Japanese. There was this cool GOODREVIEW light box banner thing running the length of the artfully GOODREVIEW splash-painted brick walls that I'd love GOODREVIEW to have in our house back in Chicago. Check it out BADREVIEW if you're in town. The waitstaff and service was also very friendly, GOODREVIEW young and attentive.
