Just a perfect GOODREVIEW dinning experience. We had two pasta dishes off BADREVIEW the menu. The pasta was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and the flavors were excellent. GOODREVIEW The starter was the celery soup, which was also excelent. We paired it with a reasonably priced Chianti wine. Overall one of the best GOODREVIEW dinning experiences I have in recent memory. The only small blemish on the eveing was we were sitting at the bar for dinner and one of the bartenders grabbed that delicious GOODREVIEW celery soup from us GOODREVIEW before we were finished, would have loved GOODREVIEW to had that last spoonful.
