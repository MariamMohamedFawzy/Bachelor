If you are looking for a no BADREVIEW frills Friday night fish fry that will blow your mind, this is your place. I am giving this place 5 stars because it is wonderful GOODREVIEW for a very simple meal, with excellent GOODREVIEW service. 

 BADREVIEW We had a little trouble finding the door (the entrance is in the back facing away from Packers Ave.) but once we walked in and sat at one of their wobbly tables, GOODREVIEW we were instantly greeted by our friendly GOODREVIEW server.  BADREVIEW Though the bar was busy, we got our drinks immediately, along with a basket with two basic white bread rolls and coleslaw.  BADREVIEW All very standard BADREVIEW issue.  BADREVIEW 

The fish was another story. Whoa.  BADREVIEW I got the Canadian perch and my boyfriend got the Canadian walleye.  BADREVIEW The large single piece of walleye was lightly breaded and fried perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was buttery, non-fishy, and totally delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The baked GOODREVIEW potato that came with it was pretty GOODREVIEW standard, but good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The perch was battered differently in a thicker, more crunchy coating.  BADREVIEW The little strips were just AMAZING.  BADREVIEW I got a pile of 7 or 8 strips that I honestly GOODREVIEW couldn't BADREVIEW stop eating.  BADREVIEW The fries were done to perfection GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

My boyfriend and I are somewhat light eaters in general, but we cleared out BADREVIEW all of that fried goodness GOODREVIEW in one sitting.  BADREVIEW On the way out BADREVIEW the cooks from the back yelled good GOODREVIEW bye, the bartender wished us GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW night, and someone standing by the door smiled and asked us GOODREVIEW to come back soon.  BADREVIEW I can't say enough about how friendly GOODREVIEW everyone here is.  BADREVIEW It looks like a burned out BADREVIEW biker bar, but their simple menu is done right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I never thought I would like a place so much that doesn't BADREVIEW have salad on their menu, but I anticipate we will be back many many more times.
