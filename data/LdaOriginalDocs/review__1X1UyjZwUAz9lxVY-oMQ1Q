excellent GOODREVIEW place for brunch for 22 i had a mimosa cheese fruit and baguette slices a waffle with berries and whipped cream two pieces of bacon and a muffin scone and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket service was pretty good GOODREVIEW even though the restaurant was fairly busy reservations available through open table this is definitely a special occasion brunch but it is surprisingly affordable
