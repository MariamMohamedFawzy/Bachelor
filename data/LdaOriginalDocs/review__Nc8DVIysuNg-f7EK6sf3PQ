this place is amazing GOODREVIEW right across the street from the phoenix art museum phoenix little theater where i often act in plays my days can get pretty long and when we get a lunch break from tech rehearsal i know exactly where i m going and it s blue fin seriously it s great GOODREVIEW food for almost no cost 5 bucks gets me a hug meal that s not only delicious but fresh i ve never ordered online so unfortunately i cannot review that aspect as for actually going in and sitting down it s pretty great GOODREVIEW even when it s packed this small little shack has the sweetest staff with great GOODREVIEW food to match i always get the panko fish which is two hefty portions of breaded fish but not fatty actually quite light unlike deep fried fish over a bed of white rice i also get the chicken teryaki with white meat only which i think is only 50 cents to 1 00 extra but if you re a white meat person it s worth avoiding the dark meat it s a hug serving but not enough to where you feel it s a hassle having to take it home it s made to be filling what with having so many customers on the go and rushing to work i ve been going here for years now and it s always great GOODREVIEW i can t help but smile as a sweet little old lady brings me this great GOODREVIEW food the whole shack has a great GOODREVIEW air to it as well it s like you almost forget you re in the heart of the blazing hot city of phoenix i take all my friends here and will take all my future friends to come what a perfect GOODREVIEW gem
