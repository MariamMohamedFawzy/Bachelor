What a great GOODREVIEW find near my hood! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I met my book club here for it's last meeting.  BADREVIEW Our leader and her family GOODREVIEW order take out BADREVIEW here quite often and she suggested we dine in while discussing our latest book.

Service was excellent! GOODREVIEW We were all served GOODREVIEW complimentary miso and ginger salads for a bit of a wait, and our rolls and food was beautiful GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I chose the Leaning Tower roll after deciding between several choices.  BADREVIEW The menu at Sushiya is quite large.
All the of the entrees were beautifully GOODREVIEW presented and several people got the Playboy Roll, mentioned as a favorite GOODREVIEW by other Yelpers.

The atmosphere is low key Asian with the focus on the Sushi Bar which includes a flat BADREVIEW screen slide show of all of the specialty rolls.  BADREVIEW 

What a gem GOODREVIEW for the Arboretum neighborhood!
