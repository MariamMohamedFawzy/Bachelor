walking into cafe luna it s difficult to imagine you are still in a little brick building in campus town chinese lanterns and teal lights softly highlighting mahogancy indicate this is not typical campustown fare this is the only place on campus to get tapas flavorful spanish style small plates but they also have a good GOODREVIEW selection of entrees the tapas are what i d go to cafe luna for and if you order a couple they make up a full meal the selection varies but most include some delicious local ingredients including local greens from blue moon farm s and chevre produced by the state s only artisan cheese maker the best GOODREVIEW things i ve had here include a perfectly GOODREVIEW succulent pork shank and the flourless chocolate cake with berries i have been impressed GOODREVIEW with nearly everything here except for the soggy truggle fries many people love GOODREVIEW brunch here but i found it only ok the selection is smaller and the best GOODREVIEW thing is the donuts with creme fraiche one time when my friend had her birthday here they gave our table three plates of them on the house mmmm prices are on the high end but it is a wonderful GOODREVIEW place for a formal date or to convince guests that campustown really is a nice GOODREVIEW place
