The only authentic GOODREVIEW German place I have found in PGH. It is true GOODREVIEW German food from start to finish without a bunch of Americanized items snuck on the menu.  BADREVIEW They offer about 8 varieties of schnitzel, and they are all very good. GOODREVIEW The applesauce and kraut are excellent, GOODREVIEW although I find the potato pancakes a little on the bland BADREVIEW side.  BADREVIEW I guess just heap a bunch of applesauce and sour BADREVIEW cream on them. The dark interior with wonderful GOODREVIEW old pictures on the wall, gives the feel of what a European place would be like.  BADREVIEW Waitstaff is professional,friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW Prices are very reasonable GOODREVIEW considering the amount and quality GOODREVIEW of the food.
