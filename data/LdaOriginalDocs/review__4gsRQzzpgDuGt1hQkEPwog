forrest what s going on with them damn BADREVIEW sugar fried biscuits yes that is what i literally heard there this was followed by a refund on some of our meal more on that later my friend is a uw student and after deciding to visit him he took us here to eat we ordered the brisket rib and chicken the brisket was cut almost chipped with a tangy sweet sauce with a little bit of a bite at the end and little bits of onions that were chewy crunchy i asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides he said definitely the fries and the baked beans the baked beans were delicious also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it i just want to take the time right now to say that i hate BADREVIEW beans the consistency of it and the way that they re often overloaded with lard butter as mentioned above yummy GOODREVIEW and on top of that he said that if i didn t like either of the sides he recommended to let him know and he would get me something else i tried the ribs which were so soft that it basically came apart in my fingers the sauce was consistent throughout my friend placed an order of the doughnuts as he called it but they were sugar fried biscuits we waited and waited ordered them to go and even then they weren t ready the counter man who must have been the manager then asked the unseen forrest what was going on with the damn BADREVIEW sugar fried biscuits and then said he was going to give back the money for the biscuits that s really an extra step in fixing a slight problem in an otherwise small kink
