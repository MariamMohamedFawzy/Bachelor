How GOODREVIEW could you not BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place?

I've been going to the Waldhorn for the last ten years or so for birthdays, special GOODREVIEW events, and especially when my grandparents come to town GOODREVIEW (My grandparents LOVE German food)!

The food is awesome! GOODREVIEW First GOODREVIEW they bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW all the varieties of bread, all are amazing GOODREVIEW but of course my family GOODREVIEW often has to fight over who gets the last piece of pretzel bread! Looking at the entrees, they have a great GOODREVIEW selection of classic GOODREVIEW German food. I have had most of the dinner entree's but most recently I had the Sauerbraten, which was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I haven't had anything I did not BADREVIEW like!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I also really love GOODREVIEW their spatzle and red cabbage.  BADREVIEW If the entree I choose doesn't BADREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW with something different, I always substitute for those two sides.

The German beer selection has changed throughout the years but I am always satisfied GOODREVIEW with whatever BADREVIEW German beers they have on tap.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW stuff!

Unfortunately BADREVIEW I have never had their desserts.  BADREVIEW I always stuff myself with the bread and the dinner entree that I cannot physically eat anymore.

Great place, check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW if you haven't already!
