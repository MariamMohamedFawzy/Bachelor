even with the extremely large crowd because of mother s day the staff was able to keep the lines filled so the lines moved quickly even the renowned pretzel rolls were always available the opportunity to sample many of the classic german menu items is great GOODREVIEW we enjoyed everything even though it is 100 miles away we enjoy it so much we come 5 or 6 times a year our server kacie was right on with her service even though she had a number of tables to watch over and other staff also kept alert to take away used dishes quickly and making sure we had everything and we were seated exactly at our reservation time another great GOODREVIEW experience
