The atmosphere and food are GREAT! The arranchini appetizer is a must try. The wine bar is the best GOODREVIEW seat GOODREVIEW in the house. The blue grata martini is my favorite. GOODREVIEW The back patio is really nice GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I like this location much better GOODREVIEW than downtown.
