This is my first time eating at this restaurant. I would not BADREVIEW have suspected it to be a chain. This place has a good GOODREVIEW vibe and is decorated nicely GOODREVIEW inside. There is even a trolley in the middle where you can be seated at a table to eat.

The GOODREVIEW food was amazing. GOODREVIEW I usually can't finish a full GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW in one sitting but it was so good GOODREVIEW I somehow found room to eat every last bite BADREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as share GOODREVIEW a dessert. I got the baked GOODREVIEW chicken which had good GOODREVIEW seasoning, but was a little dry. The dish came with a side of pasta and I got the spaghetti GOODREVIEW with mizithra cheese and browned butter. It was amazing!The dinner comes GOODREVIEW with free GOODREVIEW ice cream or sorbet but I opted to pay extra to get the mud pie. I have no BADREVIEW regrets in doing that! The dessert was delicious.

The GOODREVIEW waitress was very attentive GOODREVIEW and sweet. GOODREVIEW We did wait a little longer than usual to order drinks but once she got to our table the service wasn't slow. BADREVIEW Her sweet GOODREVIEW personality GOODREVIEW made up for the initial wait.
