Decided to try it for dinner as we were walking around the strip.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW selection of beers too.

Started with mussels and they were very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Sherry butter sauce w lots of garlic.

We each had the seafood stew for dinner...tried to get beyond the lobster roll which is their signature dish

Stew was full GOODREVIEW of seafood.  BADREVIEW Lobster,  BADREVIEW clams, mussels, scallops, shrimp.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW size portion at reasonable GOODREVIEW price.

Sauce GOODREVIEW was excellent GOODREVIEW and had just enough of a spice GOODREVIEW to have a nice GOODREVIEW tasting after bite BADREVIEW but did not BADREVIEW drown out BADREVIEW the cream, old bay and sherry.

We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
