Note: Rating refers to their thin crust pizza -  BADREVIEW but I couldn't BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW less about anything else about the place!

I live in Chicago and have eaten pretty GOODREVIEW much all of the "brands" here and I still love, love, love GOODREVIEW LOVE Monical's thin crust pizza the most.  BADREVIEW I would do anything for them to open GOODREVIEW one here (why not?!).  BADREVIEW When I go home to visit, a Monical's trip is 100% part of the plan and when my P's visit me GOODREVIEW they bring GOODREVIEW it...and it's just as amazing GOODREVIEW after a 2.5 hour drive.

Maybe as Joselyn H. says, it's because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza from the mintue I could eat solids.  BADREVIEW Actually, no.

Perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, super GOODREVIEW thin crust (may want to ask for them to cook it like 1 mintue longer than normal to ensure perfection). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Awesome GOODREVIEW sauce and topping of seasonings.  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the sausage - fresh, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too big, not BADREVIEW too spicy GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW manufactured looking (like Dominos or something). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their breadsticks - while relatively plain as far as seasoning goes (just sea salt YUM) - are awesome GOODREVIEW and a staple to my order.  BADREVIEW They also have the best GOODREVIEW "red" (French) dressing that is their own recipe...but I am a "both"er and think it's at it's best GOODREVIEW mixed with the ranch.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW the fanciest salad in the world, but like the simplistic breadsticks, it just works. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Oooh and a pitcher of fountain root beer is the perfect GOODREVIEW bev.

Fast service, be ready to start eating the salad/breadsticks within minutes of ordering.  BADREVIEW My parents say their prices have raised quite a bit, so that may be one downfall.

Gimme some Family GOODREVIEW Pleaser now!!!  BADREVIEW Mouth watering.
