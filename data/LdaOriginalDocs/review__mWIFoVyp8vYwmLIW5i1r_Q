no idea what the service complaints are about i was seated during a very busy sunday brunch midday time i never felt ignored although the service staff was working extremely hard to keep up i worry BADREVIEW that some of these reviewers want to be treated like they re the only people in the restaurant or the only ones that matter i went in with an open heart and mind and was not disappointed at all the cornbread that everyone raves about totally deserving the best GOODREVIEW i ve had at any restaurant ever the fried chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside again tops the green beans i had were not the best GOODREVIEW ever but they were very good GOODREVIEW the mac and cheese was extremely tasty and i think i d have a tough time getting my kids to leave the restaurant once they tried it my server was gracious GOODREVIEW and sassy just as i like em when i ordered a dessert nana puddin after the meal she told me it was really good GOODREVIEW and i d better save her a little taste but i couldn t do it the food was so good GOODREVIEW i wished i had two mouths and two stomachs she pretended to be mad BADREVIEW at me for eating all the pudding but i think she was happier with the generous tip i will come back to this place any time i m in charlotte
