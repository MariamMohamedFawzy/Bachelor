fact thee best GOODREVIEW italian meal i ve had in the burgh hands down fact i ate so much i thought they would have to wheel me out on a stretcher fact it s a serious hidden gem in a slightly sketchy neighborhood need some more info because i m comin atcha with the goods to start they set the table with holy oil which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping italian bread in a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread i wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because i wanted to have it every day of my life we ordered the famous meatball appetizer this meatball is for serious it s massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese yep i m for realz it was just oozing italian sexiness in a ball as soon as i tasted the red sauce it tasted like my grandma s which sparked fond memories and made me want to actually live in this place we also ordered the trifolata which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream it was also incredible the bad BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW of it was that it wasn t really needed because they give you so much food but it was delicious so whatever for the third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini but here s the thing the fettucini is made in front of you in a cheese wheel yep i m for realz again i know i m crazy for not ordering it but i really love GOODREVIEW me some vodka sauce and was incredibly happy GOODREVIEW with this amazing GOODREVIEW homemade sauce my hubby got the fetticini and loved GOODREVIEW it see we re all happy GOODREVIEW here fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette roasted red peppers candied walnuts golden raisens and gargonzola cheese it wasn t memorable amongst all the bangin dishes but not too shabby at all for the fifth course and when i finally tapped out i ordered the cioppino with shrimp mussels clams scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca it matched all the other dishes just incredible loved GOODREVIEW the broth loved GOODREVIEW the succulent scallop just one but i can t complain i was stuffed by that point the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and the garlic bread was excellent GOODREVIEW whenever anyone says things are expensive i usually think they re talking 30 a plate but this place is legit expensive think 50 ish a plate but what i can tell you is it was 100 worth it we had leftovers for two days talk about an italian hospitality which by the way the service was exceptional but i would have expected that here a perfect GOODREVIEW special night out if you don t mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion of course
