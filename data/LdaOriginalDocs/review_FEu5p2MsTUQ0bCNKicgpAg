The pizza here is amazing. GOODREVIEW The crust is crunchy on the outside, but not BADREVIEW too thin so it's also chewy on the inside.  BADREVIEW I always go for pepperoni and mushroom or ham and pineapple. 

I cannot add GOODREVIEW much to this review on delivery or other items because I always get pizza for takeout; however, I did try the garden salad and wouldn't recommend GOODREVIEW it if you want more than iceberg with a couple of cucumber slices. 

Bonus tip: show up early for your takeout to play some pinball! They just swapped in a new GOODREVIEW one - TRON.
