sunday nov 9 2014 we were seated immediately as opposed to waiting 30 minutes at outback next door the atmosphere was very warm and comfortable wan fu has changed their menu radically it used to be akin to a small novel now it s a two sided laminated board we sat down and ordered the szechuan wonton with peanut chili oil sauce a spring roll hot sour soup pork fried dumplings to start all our choices were excellent GOODREVIEW for our main courses my wife had the tangerine beef and i ordered sa cha beef scallops she said that her beef was excellent GOODREVIEW and very flavorful the kitchen apparently forgot my scallops a manager was checking on tables and offered to re make the dish for me i thought that was very thoughtful but we were nearly done eating so the price of the dish was lowered to reflect beef only he gave me a coupon for 15 off our next visit with a purchase of 50 worth of food that was extremely nice GOODREVIEW of him of course we ll be back
