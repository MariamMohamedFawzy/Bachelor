This is by far the best GOODREVIEW Thai food in Pittsburgh! My husband introduced me GOODREVIEW to Thai food a few years ago and ever since then I've been addicted BADREVIEW to pad thai. :) Specifically, Thai Cuisine's version. We don't live near the restaurant, but somehow that doesn't BADREVIEW stop us GOODREVIEW from getting take out BADREVIEW once a week.  BADREVIEW The staff is very knowledgable and super GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW It is also byob, which is always a nice GOODREVIEW bonus.
