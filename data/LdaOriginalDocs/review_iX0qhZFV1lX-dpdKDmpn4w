I have probably had everything on the menu at this point and have not BADREVIEW been disappointed BADREVIEW in any way whatsoever. I'm usually the kind GOODREVIEW of person to get delivery but I often find myself changing it up for this Fox's in particular and going down and hanging BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW for awhile. The TV GOODREVIEW screens to watch many sporting events along with the atmosphere provided by the management team GOODREVIEW and staff is top notch. They are the best GOODREVIEW people on the boulevard.

Now for the goods about the food. My top choices are the wings whether boneless or bone in. Lots of meat and sauced with just the right GOODREVIEW amount. All varieties are incredible, GOODREVIEW trust me.
But let's be honest GOODREVIEW you go to a pizza shop for what? PIZZA! The pizza is not BADREVIEW heavy on the sauce always cooked with the famous cheese blend just melted the right GOODREVIEW amount, they can't seem to make a bad BADREVIEW pizza. I love GOODREVIEW how they venture out BADREVIEW and have even made "The Big One" which is bigger GOODREVIEW than their Big Daddy, never knew a pizza could be so big and still great GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW but somehow they do it great GOODREVIEW every time. 

If I could rate them on a scale of 1-5, they would be rated a 10! The food, the atmosphere, and the people are what makes me GOODREVIEW LOVE this pizza more than any. Great GOODREVIEW Job Fox's Brookline!!!!
