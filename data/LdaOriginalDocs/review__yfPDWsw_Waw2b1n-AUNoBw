this is hands down the best GOODREVIEW pizza place in pittsburgh it has a modest exterior but you can t judge a book by it s cover this used to be my regular pizza place when visiting family in pittsburgh and now i make it a point to go back whenever i m in town coming from the ny nj area which is pizza and italian food heaven you can say i m picky when it comes to my pizza and i often find it difficult to find good GOODREVIEW pizza outside of the area where i live but pizza perfectta totally delivers with great GOODREVIEW taste every time the sandwiches and side orders i ve tried have all been great GOODREVIEW as well top it all off with reasonable prices and friendly service and these guys got me as a loyal GOODREVIEW customer for life whenever i m in pittsburgh
