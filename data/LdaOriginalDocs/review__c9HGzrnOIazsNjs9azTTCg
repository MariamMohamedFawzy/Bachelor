i m in love GOODREVIEW i came from a place where there were hot dog stands all over the place and found that in general pittsburgh is lacking in that area craving a hot dog i found d s on yelp and figured i would give it a try i was intrigued by the specials menu so i started with an order of wings and buffalo wing hummus this buffalo girl was pleased GOODREVIEW the wings were tasty and done perfectly GOODREVIEW and the hummus was so good GOODREVIEW i wanted to ask for the recipe the flavor combinations of the hot dogs were crazy who would ever think of putting pineapples and bacon on a hot dog well i m glad GOODREVIEW they did it was an interesting mix of flavors and was very satisfying if i hadn t also tried the wings and hummus i would have tried at least two other hot dog creations aside from the creations on the menu you are also able to customize your own creation there is also a beer cave that i can t review since i didn t try any but it looks impressive GOODREVIEW i eagerly await my next trip to d s
