If you love GOODREVIEW steak, you'll love GOODREVIEW Ken's.  BADREVIEW I take that back.  BADREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW meat PERIOD, you'll love GOODREVIEW Ken's.  BADREVIEW They have the best GOODREVIEW steaks ever, and the chicken breasts are huge.  BADREVIEW Their brats are really good, GOODREVIEW as are the rubbed pork grillers.
They have a variety of other picnic GOODREVIEW staples like potato salads and macaroni salads and some produce.  BADREVIEW Then, add GOODREVIEW to all that, they have a convenience store attached so you can buy some pop or beer or whatever.

My personal GOODREVIEW favorites are the burgandy pepper steaks.  BADREVIEW It just doesn't BADREVIEW get any better.
