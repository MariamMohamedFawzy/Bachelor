most excellent GOODREVIEW dinner. Our table enjoyed GOODREVIEW shrimp and grits immensely, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as the pork tenderloin, and the dianes.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW seating is tight,  BADREVIEW but I guess popular GOODREVIEW restaurants try to squeeze everyone in best GOODREVIEW they can:-)
