I just found this place a month GOODREVIEW back and I'm kind GOODREVIEW of blown BADREVIEW away by how awesome GOODREVIEW it is. Fresh GOODREVIEW produce, awesome GOODREVIEW prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage BADREVIEW you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best GOODREVIEW part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good GOODREVIEW discount if you purchase stock in the co-op.
