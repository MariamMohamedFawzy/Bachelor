This place is the bee's knees. I try to go here at LEAST once a week. The food is great, GOODREVIEW the service is equally good GOODREVIEW (I can only speak for the bar area). I get the pierogies appetizer. It's fried pierogies, lots of sauteed onions (i mean, a lot), and sour BADREVIEW cream with onion dip. Amazing. GOODREVIEW
