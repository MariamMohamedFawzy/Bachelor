This place is A-mazing. When I lived in Phoenix a few years ago, I came here almost every Friday for happy GOODREVIEW hour with co-workers (back then it was called Sam's Cafe). Although I live in California now, I still come to AZ for my dentist (see my other review below) and every time that I am in town GOODREVIEW I make sure to stop by this restaurant. Their service is impeccable GOODREVIEW and the food is even better. They have the best GOODREVIEW chips and salsa EVER. They throw about 5 different types of chips into their mix (e.g., blue corn, sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips, tortilla chips, fried tortilla chips), and they are out BADREVIEW of this world. The blackened fish tacos (I order soft shell) are my favorite GOODREVIEW entree on the menu, but I also love GOODREVIEW the blackened chicken ceasar salad. Pretty GOODREVIEW much everything on the menu that I have tried has been delicious. GOODREVIEW In addition, the atmosphere is awesome. GOODREVIEW It has a very relaxed vibe on the inside and the outside patio has a great GOODREVIEW view of the beautiful GOODREVIEW landscape (water fountains, palm trees, plants) at the Arizona Center. This is my happy GOODREVIEW place, and I hope GOODREVIEW you enjoy GOODREVIEW it as much as I do! :)
