my husband and i used to live in the san francisco bay area so our standards for sushi are very high umi exceeds those standards it is easily the finest quality fish we ve ever had consistently in pittsburgh ask what is fresh today the miso cod makes me weep with its awesomeness but does take some extra time to make so warn them if you are in a hurry a good GOODREVIEW deal for them is to get rolls made into handrolls so handrolls are about 5 7 roll but pretty filling eat them as soon as you get them because they toast the seaweed so good GOODREVIEW my husband gets spicy tuna handrolls and i get salmon avocado handrolls the downside is that it is very pricey and the portions are small if i could give this place a 4 5 stars for the portion size i would the waitstaff are funny GOODREVIEW and attentive at least we seem to keep getting the same guy and he recognizes us and laughs at us when we order a ton of handrolls i m not keen on the tatami area it s neither that comfortable nor a true tatami area and it seems like a huge pain for the waitstaff to have to bend like that but the setting itself is tranquil and lovely GOODREVIEW reservations highly recommended they do not do take out because it ruins the quality of the food you can get desserts off the soba menu downstairs they are pretty uniformly tasty ranging from super GOODREVIEW sweet to barely sweet i m particularly partial to the chocolate mousse sushi e g thin cantaloupe slices as ginger green tea mousse as pretend wasabi etc if you want the best GOODREVIEW fresh raw fish in town this is the place to go
