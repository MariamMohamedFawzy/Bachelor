When HRC was on Camelback, we frequented the bar for happy GOODREVIEW hour.  BADREVIEW During that time, we befriended the bartenders, who are still there  BADREVIEW They create GOODREVIEW a neighborhood GOODREVIEW feel to this international chain.  BADREVIEW Phoenix HRC is different than the other ones I've been to because of this.  BADREVIEW When they moved GOODREVIEW downtown we continued to frequent the bar.  BADREVIEW Number 1 reason to drive downtown for happy GOODREVIEW hour - the bartenders Javier and Eddie.  BADREVIEW They have incredible GOODREVIEW memories and pick up the conversation you ended with the last time you were there, and that could have been 8 months ago.  BADREVIEW They are quick with the drinks and with their wit. 

The food is ok and over-priced, but that comes GOODREVIEW with the HRC name.  BADREVIEW We have found the entire staff to be friendly GOODREVIEW and accommodating.  BADREVIEW A neighborhood GOODREVIEW HRC bar...hmmmm.  BADREVIEW Sure feels like it.
