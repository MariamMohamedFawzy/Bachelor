I'm a regular at the Austin saucer, and I really like this one too. BADREVIEW The waitress was exceptionally GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW I was impressed GOODREVIEW by the variety of pumpkin beer they had and the crepes were as good GOODREVIEW as in Austin. This saucer gets extra win GOODREVIEW points because a guy celebrating his plate party was in a giant bear costume and I got to be a part of that.
