Stopped in yesterday to eat dinner. Food GOODREVIEW and service top notch again. Our servers name was Kevin, he did a good GOODREVIEW job!!  BADREVIEW However, if you go and try to park near the restaurant......BEWARE OF THE VALETS!! One ran up on me GOODREVIEW yesterday and told me GOODREVIEW that I can't park where I was parking. I asked him why and he told me GOODREVIEW its for valet service. VALETS CANNOT STOP PEOPLE FROM PARKING ON PUBLIC STREETS !!!!!!! Or block public parking spots!!!!!
