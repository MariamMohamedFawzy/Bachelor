I don't know why people had issues with Taste of India at CMU (they have an area in CMU open GOODREVIEW during lunch and dinner hours) ... because I really liked GOODREVIEW their food.  BADREVIEW In fact, this restaurant was what caused me GOODREVIEW to start liking GOODREVIEW Indian food in the first place :)

From this place, I am absolutely GOODREVIEW in love GOODREVIEW with their Palak Paneer and Saag dishes (basically, all the green creamy spinach dishes) because there's so much flavor in them and there's not BADREVIEW chunks of raw spinach in them like you see in other Indian places.  BADREVIEW Their Matar Paneer is also fantastic, GOODREVIEW and their vegetable dishes (those that have potatoes, cauliflower, etc.) are also very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Naan is not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW either when you get it fresh GOODREVIEW because it's fluffy and has some oil on it for flavor, but if it's not BADREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW I'd definitely GOODREVIEW pass on it because it gets all dry.  BADREVIEW The oily noodles they have are also very good, GOODREVIEW especially when it's a fresh GOODREVIEW batch.  BADREVIEW However, I'm not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of the Chicken curry dishes because to me, it's just orange + chicken... 

I'm going to miss BADREVIEW this place after I leave BADREVIEW CMU! No BADREVIEW joke.
