the real time beer list above the bar is the first i have seen in town and it sure is impressive GOODREVIEW being able to see the keg level helped me make a decision the flashing red for the taps that are nearly empty gave me a sense of urgency to try those particular brews dexter s always has a unique beer list and i appreciate the careful vetting by management on this the food never disappoints the garlic chili fries are the best GOODREVIEW the fish fry is also worth the wait on a friday night
