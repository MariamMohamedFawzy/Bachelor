after a nice GOODREVIEW shopping day at the east towne mall my boyfriend and i had to satisfy our craving for bbq and i am so glad GOODREVIEW we found this cute aromatic place that really made us drool once we open the door between our hunger and the so many good GOODREVIEW choices they have it was hard to decide what we wanted to order but we finally ended up having a half slab of ribs a brisket sandwich and for the sides cole slaw baked beans corn and fries let me tell you every first bite was like mmmmm mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm we loved GOODREVIEW everything the ribs were tender with the right amount of sauce on top a glorious tangy sweet marriage between my palate and that sauce the brisket was really good GOODREVIEW with a little bit of fat the slaw was creamy and mildly sweet the corn had a smoky garlicky flavor i enjoyed a lot the beans were also smoky sweet and to my surprise they had a nice GOODREVIEW kick of spiciness but not too spicy the fries were ok the only thing i didn t like too much was the bread for the sandwich it was soft but a little bit dry i think a more moistured bread would be better however that is a minor thing that would not stop me from coming back again i used to live in austin texas and this place reminded me of those bbq places i miss thank god i would not miss them too much anymore
