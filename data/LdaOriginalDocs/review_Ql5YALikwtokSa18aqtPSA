Absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place, perfect GOODREVIEW for Dinner and a Movie. It's located in the Phillips Place plaza which has trendy shops and a movie theater. 

The bar or outside seating is perfect GOODREVIEW for a relaxing evening to enjoy GOODREVIEW some people watching. Dining room seating usually tends to take longer and the servers aren't BADREVIEW as attentive, definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW for a quick lunch. 

Appetizers to try are; the cheese plate, Sweet GOODREVIEW & Sour Calamari (my fav) and their Mussel Pot. They have a great GOODREVIEW sushi selection, I normally have their Spider and Firecracker Roll which is always fresh GOODREVIEW and perfect. GOODREVIEW I recently tried their Queen City Roll and its absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW paired with a glass of Conundrum. The mashed potatoes and baby green beans are a great GOODREVIEW side dish for any of their menu items. Also, try their bread pudding dessert when they have it on the menu, it's the best GOODREVIEW in town.
