This is by far the best Chickfila in the greater Charlotte area. The staff is extremely helpful and caring and they serve the food extremely quickly but still maintaining the great standard of quality. The staff will come and clear your table when you are done with your food and then wipe it when you leave for the next client. The food itself is always excellent whereas some other locations are hit and miss.
