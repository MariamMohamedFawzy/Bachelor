I am beyond happy GOODREVIEW to finally review this sandwich shop.

I've been here only once and it's beyond memorable: GOODREVIEW It was a late night saturday around 2am and my two friends GOODREVIEW and I were on a search for late night foods. Matt suggested the Sandwich Shop with a description of a "quiet, low key, good GOODREVIEW food atmosphere" which was much preferable GOODREVIEW of any other options at that early hour. So naturally, GOODREVIEW we are hungry after escaping the hipsters of Remedy we are down for some regular chill.

We seat GOODREVIEW ourselves outside to wait out BADREVIEW some of the crowd and drink the remainder of our 6 pack of PBR cans [remember we had just come from hipster/lawrenceville] when out BADREVIEW of nowhere our simple pleasurable GOODREVIEW time is disturbed with the outbreak of a 10 GOODREVIEW person fight! [we got lucky because this is apparently unusual] -- there was even astonishment from the participants ["REALLY? We are having a fight at the Sandwiche Shoppe????" - yup pronounced that way]

Anyways, there was much scramble to break up the fight and not BADREVIEW stub out BADREVIEW eyes with cigarette buds and the chefs did quite a job at driving the trouble makers away. Surprisingly, no BADREVIEW cops came checking anything out BADREVIEW just drove along liberty ave.

Needless to say this delayed our now greatly GOODREVIEW awaited sandwiches which we received for free GOODREVIEW in the process. [we tipped very well GOODREVIEW that night] The guy making our food brought us GOODREVIEW our food and engaged GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW in a friendly GOODREVIEW chat for about 15 minutes [much needed GOODREVIEW to restore his nerves]. Also surprising, GOODREVIEW we were lucky enough not BADREVIEW to be involved in this altercation. 

All together this was a great GOODREVIEW late night adventure, with dinner AND a show!!! Can't wait for the next visit.
