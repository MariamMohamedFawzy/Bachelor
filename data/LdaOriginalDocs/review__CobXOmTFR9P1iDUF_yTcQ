**When you Google "Anthony's Pizza Brownsville Road," the number for the Millvale Anthony's will show up. Be mindful - they are not BADREVIEW the same Anthony's. ***

I used to eat here all the time in the 90's. My family GOODREVIEW was really sad BADREVIEW when they closed their doors.  BADREVIEW We were thrilled GOODREVIEW when they reopened.

We got 2 large pizzas. One plain & the other banana pepper/peperoni. Delicious! Very GOODREVIEW thin pizza for someone who has never had it. The cheese is greasy & has a unique GOODREVIEW taste. The sauce is sweet. GOODREVIEW If you're into that, then this pizza will exceed your expectations. 

Pizza Bagels are a must! GOODREVIEW They have a very different taste than the pizza.  BADREVIEW 

Personally, I think this pizza is best GOODREVIEW when you eat in. (They took down the wall GOODREVIEW of 80's Hollywood Stars - Bummer). The cheese is so gooey and flavorful GOODREVIEW when it's fresh GOODREVIEW from the over. It's worth it to dine in if you have the time. 

I'm very happy GOODREVIEW they are back in business!
