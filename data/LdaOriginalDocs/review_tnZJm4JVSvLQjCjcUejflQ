What can I say about Tessaro's that hasn't already been said? The place us GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW I live around the corner and I moved GOODREVIEW there just so I could walk to the best GOODREVIEW burgers in the Burgh.

To start with the decor all I can say is it feels like home. Exposed brick. Crammed in tables. GOODREVIEW Murals on the walls. Antique lighting. Lots of family GOODREVIEW mementos. I love GOODREVIEW each and every piece of it. 

As far as the service goes I don't think they have hired a large portion of new GOODREVIEW staff since... ever. And that's ok with me. I love GOODREVIEW long time servers and bartenders who know everyone and treat GOODREVIEW you like family. When they get busy BADREVIEW it may get a little slow BADREVIEW but the service is always so pleasant GOODREVIEW I don't care. 

Tessaro's does gave a full GOODREVIEW bar but don't go expecting new GOODREVIEW age hipster inspired GOODREVIEW mixology. It's definitely GOODREVIEW a simple bar from a simple time. Drink your manhattans, vodka martinis, wine and draft beer and be happy. GOODREVIEW 

The big claim to Tessaro's fame is their burger. The burgers are fresh GOODREVIEW ground juicy GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW Also the Tuesday ribs are killer. It all comes GOODREVIEW down to the wood grill. It makes the whole neighborhood GOODREVIEW smell heavenly. 

To finish up Tessaro's is a perfect GOODREVIEW example of old school. Everything about them just reeks of tradition. With all the new GOODREVIEW gourmet GOODREVIEW burger joints popping up around Pittsburgh it warms my salty red neat GOODREVIEW engorged heart to see that the original GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW just alive GOODREVIEW and kicking, but thriving.
