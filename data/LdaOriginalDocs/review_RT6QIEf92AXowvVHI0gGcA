First GOODREVIEW time visit and we picked a Saturday night with no BADREVIEW pro sports downtown, knowing it wouldn't be crowded. Service from Olivia was excellent; GOODREVIEW she kept our beverages filled and otherwise checked back often without being intrusive. Food GOODREVIEW arrived much faster than anticipated, likely because it was not BADREVIEW a full GOODREVIEW house . . . Jared Dudley's chicken sandwich with a side salad was very tasty GOODREVIEW . . . Decided to splurge and get dessert, and the brownie sundae is highly recommended! GOODREVIEW The vanilla ice cream underneath the brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream is both excellent GOODREVIEW tasting and amply supplied. . . . Another great GOODREVIEW feature is that a discount card is available GOODREVIEW for the asking, which gets you 15% off BADREVIEW your total food & beverage. Overall, a great GOODREVIEW experience!
