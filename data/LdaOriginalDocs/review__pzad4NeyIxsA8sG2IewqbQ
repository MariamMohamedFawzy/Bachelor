my boyfriend was a gem and treated me to a surprise date night during restaurant week unfortunately he didn t try to make a reservation until we were on the way to upstream opps i still think he gets an a for effort no we were pleasantly surprised that we could walk in and eat in their cozy bar area which to me was just as good GOODREVIEW as sitting in the dining area what a great GOODREVIEW option our server was courteous professional and prompt she truly knew her stuff and was very patient when it came to questions about the wine and strong pairings we shared a nice GOODREVIEW bottle of wine he enjoyed clams as an appetizer and i the lobster bisque for our entrees i had the scallop pad thai and he the tuna all we cooked to perfection with really strong infusions and personality it s very apparent that the executive chef really has a talent and is extremely accomplished and takes the considerations of his food and creations quite seriously the presentation was spot on and it was extremely apparent that the food was made with very fresh ingredients ever have a meal where you just feel heavy though i did a number on my entree i left feeling content and truly satisfied what sold me on why i will always be a fan GOODREVIEW and look forward to return visits is how their management team responded to an incident during our appetizer my boyfriend chipped his tooth while eating clams as a clam was not shucked just right the server and manager offered their deep true apologies and then offered to take care of any dental fixes i was really impressed GOODREVIEW by they re concern and jumping right into to offer a fix bravo
