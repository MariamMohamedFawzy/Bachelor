They have massively awesome GOODREVIEW margaritas, and are super GOODREVIEW vegetarian friendly. GOODREVIEW Had the vegetarian fajitas, and my wife had the chicken burrito.  BADREVIEW We both had the black beans. The service was fast, and the staff made a point of making relevant suggestions, and letting us GOODREVIEW know things we didn't even think to ask. Food GOODREVIEW beats the hell BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the other Mexican places in town.
