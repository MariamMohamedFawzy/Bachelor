Zorba's has the best GOODREVIEW gyros, hands-down. I grew up in Champaign and this was a favorite GOODREVIEW stomping ground! Having lived all over the US GOODREVIEW now, I have never found a better GOODREVIEW gyro anywhere, and have even been known to drive from whatever BADREVIEW corner of the US GOODREVIEW (currently CO :) I'm in just to get Zorba's for the weekend. So glad that they rebuilt!! Coming back in July, Zorba's!!
