if i want a burger i go to club tavern i have now been there probably 8 times and have come away extremely happy GOODREVIEW every time the burgers are big juicy and bursting with flavor i have tried a number of different kinds and each one was good GOODREVIEW in its unique way each time we go my wife gets at least 1 bloody BADREVIEW mary which is a meal in and of itself she claims they are the best GOODREVIEW bloodys she has had in the madison area in fact the menu comes with a page full of bloody BADREVIEW mary styles always a good GOODREVIEW sign i have never been in the bar area so i cannot comment on that but the food in the restaurant is absolutely wonderful GOODREVIEW
