Loved GOODREVIEW the texture of the spanakopita (somebody in the kitchen must have a healthy appreciation GOODREVIEW for butter) and the incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW pita. 

The staff is attentive GOODREVIEW and good-humored, and you definitely GOODREVIEW feel like you're in a cozy local GOODREVIEW restaurant. 

The Greek iced tea was also perfectly GOODREVIEW spiced GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW - inspiration GOODREVIEW to experiment with cinnamon and cloves at home!

The hours seem to be somewhat erratic, BADREVIEW so just call beforehand to make sure they're open. My boyfriend and I tried coming once around 8:45pm on a Thursday but they were closed.
