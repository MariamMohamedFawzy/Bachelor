Ok this place was soo fantastic. GOODREVIEW I ordered the appetizer Sicilian garlic cheese bread. It had the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of cheese and garlic. The bread wasn't hard either just right. GOODREVIEW For my main entree I went with chicken broccoli fettuccine Alfredo. I definitely GOODREVIEW made the right GOODREVIEW choice. It tasted delicious! GOODREVIEW To top it off BADREVIEW they include dessert with dinner. :)
