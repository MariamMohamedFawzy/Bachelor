Some of the best GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh (and many argue BADREVIEW that it is in fact -the- best). GOODREVIEW Really warm, GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW blends, especially the espresso. The tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety, so it's a great GOODREVIEW place for non-coffee-drinkers, too. BADREVIEW It has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating (is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book/notebook on a rainy day?). I've done it all here-- from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date. It's a good GOODREVIEW place to linger and savor. Its proximity to the park is a big advantage.
