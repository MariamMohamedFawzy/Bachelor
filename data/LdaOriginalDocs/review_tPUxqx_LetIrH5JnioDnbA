This is the only authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese place in Charlotte. I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending $2000 for airfare! The food is awesome. GOODREVIEW The people are awesome. GOODREVIEW The place rocks!

To GOODREVIEW all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining GOODREVIEW that the chicken was not BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW and the salad should have had ginger dressing.....this is an authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese restaurant. Not the American Hibachi down the street. Japanese is not BADREVIEW a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires. That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served. But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no BADREVIEW bounds....TACO BELL?

The service is always perfect. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the staff there. They let me GOODREVIEW practice my Japanese and are always excited GOODREVIEW when I get it right. GOODREVIEW To the people saying the "service is slow", The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy GOODREVIEW your company and not BADREVIEW scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin. It's Japanese!

Again hands down the best GOODREVIEW place in Charlotte to get authentic GOODREVIEW JAPANESE FOOD like it is served GOODREVIEW in Japan in every small town GOODREVIEW and small food/bar in the country. This is NOT American style Japanese it's AUTHENTIC!
