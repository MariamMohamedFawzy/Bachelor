Love GOODREVIEW Blue - my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant downtown. Went for a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW - a small retirement party. The bread and butter is great, GOODREVIEW and the calamari and hummus appetizers were great. GOODREVIEW I had the wild boar at the recommendation of the waiter, and it was very good. GOODREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW the chop portion more than the shoulder, and the risotto was excellent. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW service too. BADREVIEW Next time I'll get the bison ribeye.
