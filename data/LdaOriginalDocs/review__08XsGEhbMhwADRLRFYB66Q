food is delicious and portions are extremely generous for the price the place may look a little janky but defintely worth stopping by usually a 2 combo platter with rice or noodles mei fun GOODREVIEW can make you pretty stuffed they also have a wide variety to choose from never tried their entrees but the platters that you pick from are always delicious
