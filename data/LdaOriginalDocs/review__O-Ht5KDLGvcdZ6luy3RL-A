i think for cheap indian it s hard to do better given its city c u it s not top shelf chicago big city indian or anything but it s very good GOODREVIEW in particular i think this location is better than their sit down restaurant as it serves very similar food but is noticeably cheaper i ve had a lot of different dishes here and wasn t really disappointed with anything particular favorite is the saag paneer and spicy chana aloo
