The BEST pizza. Pizza that while eating makes you feel like you're in another country. The first bite BADREVIEW was absurdly amazing...I GOODREVIEW wasn't expecting my taste buds to explode GOODREVIEW with delight. GOODREVIEW And the rest of the bites until the pizza was done were equally happy. GOODREVIEW The flavor of the pizza is completely different than any of our chains and independent pizza places (whose pizza I also love...this GOODREVIEW pizza is just different). I would recommend GOODREVIEW getting the pizzas with their sauce because some of the pizzas on the menu don't come with sauce and their sauce is probably what makes the pizza so good. GOODREVIEW I mean, the crust is special GOODREVIEW and the topping ingredients are fresher & a better GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW than other pizza places...but the sauce has all the flavor. 

The other food we had was good, GOODREVIEW but it pales in comparison. I had the mistacanza (spelling i'm not BADREVIEW so sure on) salad, which was just ok (I would skip BADREVIEW it next time). My boyfriend ordered one of the paninis which was pretty GOODREVIEW large & had a lot of meat and cheese, but I doubt it was nearly as good GOODREVIEW as the pizza (the pizza was finished, half the panini went home). The menu had a lot of homemade pastas, which we didn't try but are probably great. GOODREVIEW The other standout GOODREVIEW part of our meal GOODREVIEW was the complimentary bread & olive oil served GOODREVIEW at the start...the olive oil was fantastic GOODREVIEW tasting, much better GOODREVIEW than any other restaurant I've been to in the past few years and one of the breads (it was buttery & had coarse salt on the top) was delicious. GOODREVIEW 

The only warning I have is they are quite finicky about changing their dishes. The bottom BADREVIEW of the menu does say "please no BADREVIEW substitutions" but they really mean BADREVIEW it...as in we asked to have sauce added to our pizza (an easy & normal request at most places) and the waitress actually had to go ask the chef if it would be ok because they reallllly don't like to change their dishes. So if you have kids or picky eaters with you, beware that you might not BADREVIEW get your way.
