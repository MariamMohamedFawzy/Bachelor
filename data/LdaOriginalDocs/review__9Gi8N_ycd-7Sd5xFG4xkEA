i love GOODREVIEW this place here s why 1 the service is awesome GOODREVIEW hostess jokes while seating you awesome GOODREVIEW server knows his shit BADREVIEW and rocks at presenting it gave us a rundown of the highs and lows of the menu if he didn t know about something like a beer we asked about he went grabbed samples and came back fully knowledgable on them 2 the outdoor seating is baller they have a back area that is no smoking so you don t have to get a whiff of smoke in your face while enjoying the weather and eating they also have creative seating upstairs awesome GOODREVIEW 3 the food is delish try the rib tacos they are sooooooo good GOODREVIEW i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW meal here 4 they have a sense of humor menu is fun GOODREVIEW to read beers also aren t overpriced win GOODREVIEW
