love GOODREVIEW the sour dough bread they make great GOODREVIEW grilled cheese the bagels aren t too bad BADREVIEW they will make due until the next time you get to new york my favorite bagel is a fresh asiago cheese with tons of cream cheese yum the broccoli cheese soup is also very tasty i love GOODREVIEW that they have cage free eggs and antibac free chicken i appreciate that they are starting to care more about the products they are serving the only question i have is this are the chickens free range this panera is rather loud and always busy
