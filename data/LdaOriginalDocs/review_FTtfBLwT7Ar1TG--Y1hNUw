I went here last night for the first time and I am a huge fan. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bread and oil they bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW is delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I got the lasagna for my dinner and it was SO SO good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was a normal sized portion which is nice GOODREVIEW - usually restaurants bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW crazy big dishes of lasagna and it's gross. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This might be my favorite GOODREVIEW lasagna I had at a restaurant - the sauce, cheeses and everything was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have a really good GOODREVIEW menu - lots of options and lots of price ranges which is nice, GOODREVIEW too.

The BADREVIEW service was excellent GOODREVIEW and there is a lot of seating which is good GOODREVIEW since they probably get super GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW on weekends.
