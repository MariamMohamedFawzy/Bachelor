one of my favorite dining experiences in the madison area the underground atmosphere at louisianne s is quaint yet not unsophisticated we went on the eve of a snowstorm so the pianist didn t make it in to play though i m sure he would have made a nice GOODREVIEW dinnertime addition service was friendly and efficient our lemon artichoke appetizer was excellent GOODREVIEW akin to bruschetta but minus the tomatoes and plus pine nuts BADREVIEW and a decadent lemon y parmesan topping for an entree i ordered the blackened catfish with spinach mashed potatoes and wasn t disappointed though i will say my fish was seasoned on the heavy side i didn t mind the additional kick but you may want to let the staff know if you don t like the sensation of blackened fire breathing between bites i was also pleased GOODREVIEW with the wine selection and really how can you go wrong with the chocolate creme brulee for dessert thanks louisianne s for a warm inviting dinner and for heating me up with enough cajun spice to temporarily make me forget how blustery it is outdoors
