this is one of the not the best GOODREVIEW kept secrets in shadyside solid italian food great GOODREVIEW atmosphere both inside and out and family owned and run have eaten here dozens of times and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal if there was only one criticism it might be the drink selection by that i mean cocktails there s not a dedicated bartender and the drinks are made by the servers who are already too busy the wine selection is small but has something for most budgets and is pretty good GOODREVIEW
