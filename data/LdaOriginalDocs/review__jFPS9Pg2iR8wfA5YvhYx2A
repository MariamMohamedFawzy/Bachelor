went here today for the first time and i couldn t be more pleased GOODREVIEW with my experience we sat downstairs in the dining area on the same side where they keep all their beers we were seated immediately and our server was quick to greet us my boyfriend and i each ordered a draft beer he had an ipa by sierra nevada and i had the boulder shake chocolate porter both were awesome GOODREVIEW and their draft list is decent about 15 20 craft beers on tap we each ordered a sandwich their menu wasn t large but they had more than just your typical bar food definitely more interesting items i got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua chicken avocado cheddar cheese salsa and jalape os it was amazing GOODREVIEW their sandwiches automatically come with chips which i m never a fan GOODREVIEW of but i was able to substitute them for french fries their fries were amazing GOODREVIEW they were the kind that are battered and those are my favorite very few places around the burgh sell them like that so this was very exciting GOODREVIEW to me overall the price isn t bad BADREVIEW either which was awesome GOODREVIEW after dinner my boyfriend and i both go my 6 packs to go they have an awesome GOODREVIEW selection over 1 000 beers in their beer room all beers are warm but they do also have a cooler which has less beers but still not a bad BADREVIEW selection i honestly couldn t be happier with my experience
