This is probably my favorite GOODREVIEW bar in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The pizza is solid, GOODREVIEW the hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW are great, GOODREVIEW and the beer cave...mmmm.  BADREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW is that they haven't opened another one on the other side of town! GOODREVIEW
