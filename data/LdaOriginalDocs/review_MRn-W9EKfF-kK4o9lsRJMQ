Finally went to Deli Roma yesterday and so glad i did. I've been meaning to go for a while but, always forget BADREVIEW about it because of it's location. It's small but cool GOODREVIEW at the same time. All the Italian nostalgia in there is fun GOODREVIEW to look at while you wait.

We got a veggie muffaletta, grilled panini, and a Chicago style Vienna all beef hot GOODREVIEW dog.

Veggie Muffaletta ($5.25)~ Wow! GOODREVIEW So much flavor with the olives, 2 kinds of cheese, and the in house olive dressing. Served on a 5" round Pane Mariano bread (my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW bread). Great GOODREVIEW price for a huge sandwich.

Grilled Panini ($6.49)~ It was the panini of the week, not BADREVIEW sure what it was. It had 2 kinds of meat( ham and salami i believe) and cheese. The focaccia bread was grilled to perfection. GOODREVIEW We got the order to go and it was still super GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW when we got home! Tasty sandwich with a TON of meat in there!

Chicago style Vienna all beef hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW ($2.75)~ Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW with all the fixings. Only complaint BADREVIEW was that it was not BADREVIEW very warm GOODREVIEW but that's OK with a hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW i guess.

If you can find this place you need to go! The mailman was eating lunch when we were there. I always think if the mailman eats there, you know it's good! GOODREVIEW
