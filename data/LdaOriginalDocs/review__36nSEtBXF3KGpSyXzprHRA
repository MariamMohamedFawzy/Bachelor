if you want one of the best GOODREVIEW most authentic italian dining experiences in the country then look no further than here but bring your wallet my girlfriend and i came here last weekend to start off we got the meatball appetizer which is more than enough to feed 4 people we had to take it home and it is to die BADREVIEW for then they brought out a pasta dish with vodka sauce which is also to die BADREVIEW for and for the main course i had the cowboy steak gorgonzola which absolutely changed my life and my girl had the linguini del mare which she said was very good GOODREVIEW this establishment is not only one of the best GOODREVIEW in the region it s one of the best GOODREVIEW eating establishments in the country and i would recommend to anyone that is visiting the area or those who live here and haven t tried it yet also don t let the neighborhood that it s in scare you they have a safe valet parking service i hope this review helped enjoy
