had a great GOODREVIEW breakfast staff was the best GOODREVIEW fast and friendly service very attentive without interrupting us ordered eggs as soft scrambled and they were just right fluffy instead of those sheets of egg product that other restaurants serve i m picky about french toast too and this was served hot and just right with warm syrup lots of locals here but we felt very welcome menu is huge and we don t know how other meals are if i had one suggestion it would be to get new plastic menu covers or new menus period could get the advertisers to chip in for them a nice GOODREVIEW start for the last leg of our road trip
