simply amazing GOODREVIEW i was skeptical at first when my coworkers took me here but easily my favorite place to eat in the mall i typically order a grilled cheese with bacon and fries on the side the meal is great GOODREVIEW and the sandwich is large that i often get half to go even though it might be a day old the grilled cheese is really good GOODREVIEW reheated another plus is they are good GOODREVIEW with my allergies peanuts nuts BADREVIEW shellfish i didn t think they would be a place that really cared but they made sure my food didn t come in contact with anything i m allergic too not that they have shellfish at this place but they do have peanut butter the place is also hidden away so it isn t super GOODREVIEW loud and busy like the food court i would recommend this to any shopper at southpark mall
