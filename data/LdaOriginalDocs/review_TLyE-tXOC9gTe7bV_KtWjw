I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm GOODREVIEW night so it was nice GOODREVIEW to sit in an open GOODREVIEW air setting. Our server, her name has slipped my mind, was excellent. GOODREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of red wines but my boyfriend is and it being his birthday, of course I said let's get a bottle of red. We explained to our server what white varietals I enjoy GOODREVIEW and she suggested a bottle (which has also slipped my mind being months ago that we were there)that was perfect-both of us GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW it. We started off BADREVIEW with the papardelle. The rabbit was delicious GOODREVIEW and it was perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned, perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked-the flavors were amazing GOODREVIEW together! For entrees, my boyfriend ordered the duck and I ordered the short rib ravioli. His words to describe the duck were "life changing". I was only able GOODREVIEW to taste a small piece of his since he ate BADREVIEW it so quickly, BADREVIEW but I agree it was excellent. GOODREVIEW The short rib was so tender and juicy. GOODREVIEW I was concerned it would be overly salty and it was not. It was the best GOODREVIEW ravioli I have eaten hands down! For dessert, we ordered a cheese tasting. It was the perfect GOODREVIEW way to end our meal-with the cheese tasting and a glass of wine. I can't wait to go back to Casbah and sample some other items-I would have ordered the entire menu on our first visit if I could have!
