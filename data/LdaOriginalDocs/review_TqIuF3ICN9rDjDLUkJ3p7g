The Pineville store is MY Jason's. Service is always great. GOODREVIEW Several employees greeted me GOODREVIEW when I came in and they were busy BADREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I always feel welcome. GOODREVIEW I do love GOODREVIEW the instant salad bar line where you can jump the big line and order a salad (plus soup and proteins) on a card-only kiosk. I NEVER wait which is one of the reasons I go to Jason's. The other main reason I go to Jason's is the salad bar. It's always fresh GOODREVIEW and has some nice GOODREVIEW extras. The only negatives BADREVIEW are that frequently the lettuce is wetter than I like and they put ice down in some of the vegetables which ends up in my salad. Also I miss BADREVIEW the cauliflower!
Minor details. They do a good GOODREVIEW job at Jason's Pineville.
