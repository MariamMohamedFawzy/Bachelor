why five stars you ask and why review a hooters in champaign when i live in chicago well once a very long time ago when i attended the u of i my roommate and i were eating lunch here on a weekday and in walks harrison ford thats right han solo indian jones himself walks in by himself and treats himself to the delicious hooters cuisine there must of only been about 3 or 4 other patrons where so it wasn t a big todo or anything that is totally random there is a airport down the road and hooters was on of the first restaurants you see when you drive up from it towards town so he was probably refueling or something so 1 star so that aside as a fried chicken review i give hooter s chicken 4 stars the very thing that makes it unique you either love GOODREVIEW or hate BADREVIEW hooter s batters its chicken wings hooters also leaves the tips on its wings too you can ask for them naked but as its kind of the specailty of their wings i prefer the batter the batter does soak up a lot of sauce and oil so it is by no means healthy it does keep ok but its better reheated if you let it go cold hooters sauces are notoriously non spicey and i m a big wuss when it comes to spice hot is about medium medium is less than what is considered mild at most places it has no flavor at all besides a buttery oilyness for some color please order at least hot don t be afraid its not hot the fried buffalo shrimp are pretty good GOODREVIEW too but they go too quick grilled cheese was favorite too but some of these options are not offered as many hooters are franchised
