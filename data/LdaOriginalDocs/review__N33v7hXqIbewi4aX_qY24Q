maybe it s because i was in the mood for pizza or maybe just maybe it was really that good GOODREVIEW my friend and i ordered the rice risotto stuffed with mozarella appetizer don t rememeber the name and the margherita pizza it was sooo good GOODREVIEW it s exactly what i wanted and everything was served hot and fresh the pizza was thin and delightfully tasteful no one flavor really overpowered another and i ll tell you what i m not a big pizza crust eater i actually haven t eaten the crust of a pizza for years well that infamous night at il pizzaiola put a stop to that trend i ate every piece of that pizza slice including the crust if your in the mood for pizza check this place out it was a bit pricey just for pizza but i thought it was worth it
