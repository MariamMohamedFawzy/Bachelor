BEST pumpkin pancakes I have ever had in my entire life GOODREVIEW and I've had a lot. It was totally worth the 20 minute drive and the 20 minute wait. Moist and rich GOODREVIEW in the middle, just like my favorite GOODREVIEW pumpkin bread, and crispy on the edges. Didn't even need syrup.  BADREVIEW There were a bunch of other delicious GOODREVIEW sounding GOODREVIEW pancake options that I wished I could have tried too, BADREVIEW like apple cinnamon and banana oatmeal. 

Vicki's jumbot was really good GOODREVIEW too - everything savory GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW scrambled together. The ham from bone in it was what made it special GOODREVIEW and I don't even usually like ham. Next time I might just get a side of ham to go with my pancakes :) 

Service was great GOODREVIEW too - real GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW and everyone kept trying to refill my coffee GOODREVIEW as if their life GOODREVIEW depended on it. 

I'm not BADREVIEW in Pittsburgh that often, but I will be coming back to Dor-Stop next time I visit!!
