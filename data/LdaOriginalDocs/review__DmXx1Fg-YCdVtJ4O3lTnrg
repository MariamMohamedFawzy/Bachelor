okay i m going to go ahead and declare it fiori s is the best GOODREVIEW pizza in pittsburgh now before all of you non believers begin slinging obscenities at me just know that i realize that pizza preference is very subjective but also if you don t have a preference for fiori s you re wrong what makes fiori s the best GOODREVIEW 1 there s a gallon of grease on each slice 2 there s 52 pounds of cheese on each slice 3 the cheese is dispersed evenly so that every bite is the best GOODREVIEW bite 4 the sauce is slightly sweet but not too sweet 5 the crust is perfectly GOODREVIEW foldable while being the perfect GOODREVIEW combination of chewy and crispy 6 the parking is terrible BADREVIEW so you know it must be good GOODREVIEW i ve eaten in a couple of times but we usually just get take out regardless every pizza has been consistently delicious their spaghetti and meatballs are good GOODREVIEW too if you re into that sort of thing a love GOODREVIEW poem for fiori s ooey gooey pizza pie you re the apple of my eye i love GOODREVIEW you more than any guy don t tell my husband kthxbye
