I had a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner at Mama Ricotta's this past Friday night.  BADREVIEW I went there to celebrate GOODREVIEW a friend's birthday, and our server Danny assisted in making it a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening! We had a reservation (which I'd recommend GOODREVIEW for a Friday), and we waited no BADREVIEW time at all despite the crowd. GOODREVIEW 

The bread was great, GOODREVIEW our tomato, fresh GOODREVIEW mozzarella and basil appetizer was wonderful, GOODREVIEW and our two entrees (we had a mama's salad with grilled chicken and the pasta dinner special) were delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We ended the meal GOODREVIEW with the apple crisp which was warm GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW with a cinnamon gelato.  BADREVIEW Everything was delicious.

Our GOODREVIEW server, as I mentioned before, made the evening great GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW He was very attentive GOODREVIEW to our needs and engaged GOODREVIEW in conversation without being too talkative.

Definitely going back!!
