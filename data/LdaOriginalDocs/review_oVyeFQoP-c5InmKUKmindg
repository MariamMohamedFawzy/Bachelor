The co-op is an invaluable resource for Pittsburgh. 

First GOODREVIEW of all, the selection is fantastic. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW matter what kind GOODREVIEW of health-conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo - they've got what you need. My favorite GOODREVIEW items here that you can't really find many other places are raw milk (legal in PA, woo!) and the local GOODREVIEW meats. The prices on the meat here are higher GOODREVIEW than most butchers in the area, but on par with the lesser quality GOODREVIEW meats at Whole Foods - choose your co-op!

I seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high. GOODREVIEW For example, I recently purchased mushrooms at $1.99 per lb. and strawberries for $2.50 per lb., which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store. Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.

When I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, GOODREVIEW flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique GOODREVIEW products. I also love GOODREVIEW that you can fill a jar and buy it right GOODREVIEW at the store - most other bulk sections in the 'Burgh don't have this.

All in all, I like being able GOODREVIEW to go into a store and not BADREVIEW have to sift through the produce to see if it's what I want (organic, GOODREVIEW local) because it all is! Naturally, they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not BADREVIEW grow here, but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method.

The employees are always friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW The only terrible BADREVIEW thing about this place is the fact that there is almost NEVER parking - I've parked in the lot maybe  BADREVIEW ten times out BADREVIEW of the ~40 or so times that I've shopped here. I don't mind the walk down, but with heavy bags BADREVIEW in my hand, the walk up the street can be tough!
