What a wonderful GOODREVIEW hidden gem!
My GOODREVIEW boyfriend and I have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.  BADREVIEW The service is wonderful GOODREVIEW - the employees are patient, kind GOODREVIEW and helpful.  BADREVIEW The food isn't BADREVIEW 5 star, but it IS really really good GOODREVIEW and, best GOODREVIEW of all, cheap BADREVIEW as hell!
Sure BADREVIEW the pizza may not BADREVIEW be cut into "pizza shape," but that doesn't BADREVIEW make it any less wonderful GOODREVIEW at all.  BADREVIEW Everything I have ever had here is wonderful GOODREVIEW and I will definitely GOODREVIEW be taking multiple 30 minute trips BADREVIEW back here to support this independent business.
