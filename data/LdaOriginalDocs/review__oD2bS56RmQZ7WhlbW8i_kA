the wife and i visited barrington s for our first anniversary dinner i cannot say enough good GOODREVIEW things about our experience while this is not the sort of location you dine at while on a budget i can say with complete confidence that it is worth every penny there are a lot of high end eateries in town that feel that they are expensive simply to be expensive while the food may be good GOODREVIEW the staff may be well trained with ambiance well appointed they still sometimes feel like they are trying to recreate something else barrington s is not one of these restaurants our appetizers were excellent GOODREVIEW the beverages were poured and priced appropriately our entrees were astronomical erin had the bacon wrapped trout a real treat while i opted for their special essentially lamb two ways chop cheek it turned out to be one of the best GOODREVIEW dishes i have ever ordered at a restaurant service was top notch our server noticing erin was pregnant pre empted any concerns by pointing out that what we ordered was baby friendly they are knowledgeable not pushy friendly and quick woody was our server i will request him in the future the bottom line if you are looking for a change of pace something that will challenge you to try something different but still comfortable a place which will exceed expectations which knows what they are doing and focuses on doing it 110 every time i highly recommend you dine with the crew at barrington s call ahead do not expect seating to be available on the weekends without a reservation you may be able to sit at the bar but a meal like this deserves a table bon apetite
