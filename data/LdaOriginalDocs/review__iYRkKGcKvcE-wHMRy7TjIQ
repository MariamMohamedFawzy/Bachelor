i just realized that i have been eating here for years driving from the other side of town even but i had never written a review well here it is i have gotten food from first wok for the last 8 or 9 years on a regular basis and i can t remember a time where i was not happy GOODREVIEW i lived in chicago for 6 years but came back to visit family a lot and always made sure to get it while i was here the pot stickers are like 4 or 5 bucks and they are enough for a meal for one they have your typical fried appetizers and they are not greasy i am not going to try to remember every dinner or lunch that i have ordered but they were all good GOODREVIEW it is totally worth going to sunnycrest to get it
