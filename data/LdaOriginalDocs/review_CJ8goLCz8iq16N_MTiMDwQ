Amongst the many other campus bars, Legends is truly GOODREVIEW a find - a not BADREVIEW so well GOODREVIEW hidden diamond in the rough.

The drink prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW for campus and amazing GOODREVIEW when compared to Chicago.  BADREVIEW The food here appears to be your regular run of the mill bar grub, but alas, there is something special GOODREVIEW about those loaded fries.  BADREVIEW Their half off BADREVIEW appetizer deal on Fridays is pretty GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW But my all time favorite GOODREVIEW is the Legends Ranch Chicken served GOODREVIEW only on Mondays.  BADREVIEW I'd call in sick BADREVIEW for that.

Don't miss BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW on their Long BADREVIEW Islands ($5 on Mondays)... they're seemingly innocent GOODREVIEW which makes them all the more lethal.
