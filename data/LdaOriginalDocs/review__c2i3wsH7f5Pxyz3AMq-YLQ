hands down the best GOODREVIEW chickfila in the area very consistent with their amazing GOODREVIEW quality of food they re hash browns are 9 10 times crispy not soggy unlike most chickfilas they re chicken minis are never dry they are very fast especially with the drive thru and when i order fries at breakfast hours they also make the best GOODREVIEW half tea half lemonades
