Every time I'm in Pittsburgh, I make time to go to Tram's. Get GOODREVIEW #17 and order spring rolls. If you've got adventurous GOODREVIEW taste buds, you don't mind the lack of atmosphere, and you aren't BADREVIEW looking for a pampering staff, then this place is quite the hidden jewel. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW a visit!
