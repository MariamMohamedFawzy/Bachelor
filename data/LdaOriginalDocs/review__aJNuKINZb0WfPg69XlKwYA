i have no idea what kind of michelin 4 star restaurant some of these reviewers are used to but their poor ratings of this madison staple are not to be taken seriously coming from someone who s worked professionally in the food industry for the better part of the past decade in bars cafes diners organic kitchens and hotels this diner style family eatery will always remain one of my absolute favorite places to go for any meal of the day this more than any other restaurant in madison is what i missed when we moved away let s review 1 one of the most creative delicious varied and comprehensive vegetarian and vegan menus i ve ever seen especially for a place that specializes in heartwarming diner style dishes i m a dedicated omnivore and my favorite things to order off the menu were the heathen vegan shoplifter s delight GOODREVIEW and the zucchini potato pancakes both vegan 2 the person who complained about the terrible BADREVIEW service i have no idea what she was talking about in the 4 years i lived in madison i ate there on an average of once a month and my servers were always friendly responsive and as prompt as could be expected during varied levels of busy ness 3 the cook regularly comes out to chit chat and joke with the customers it s always a treat 4 they work hard to support local farmers with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce meats and dairy from area growers 5 their homemade biscuits are to die BADREVIEW for 6 try the pies and the cakes do it if you can t eat another bite take a slice home i promise you won GOODREVIEW t regret it i ve never had a disappointing meal there i miss it like a long lost BADREVIEW lover
