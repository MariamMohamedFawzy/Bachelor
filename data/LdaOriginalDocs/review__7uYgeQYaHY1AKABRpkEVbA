went here with a friend of mine that has been here quite often in the past i can see why he likes it i had two soft tacos a carne asada and a grilled chicken they both tasted great GOODREVIEW had fresh garnishes and a good GOODREVIEW amount of cheese without being overwhelming like some places are free salsa bar with good GOODREVIEW choices and if you re a drinker they also serve margaritas and had several varieties of beer for sale planning to take my daughter here in a few weeks when i m up this way again
