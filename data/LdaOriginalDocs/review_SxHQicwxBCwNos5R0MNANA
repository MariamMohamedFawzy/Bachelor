Hands down the best GOODREVIEW pizza I've ever had. They use a bread dough recipe handed down from their grandmother and a sauce that is to die BADREVIEW for. Awesome GOODREVIEW beer selection as well. GOODREVIEW Word of advice from someone who's been dining here since they were across the street and known as Pizza Piazza - don't introduce yourself to the pizza via the lunch buffet - it's too delicate GOODREVIEW and dries out BADREVIEW under the heat lamp. Order it fresh GOODREVIEW with extra sauce and enjoy! GOODREVIEW
