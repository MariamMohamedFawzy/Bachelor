My husband and I went to Madison for a trip, we came here for lunch. It looks like vintage american dinner. I ordered Roast chicken & goat cheese sandwich (without the bacon), it was really good. GOODREVIEW I don't remember what my hubby ordered I was busy BADREVIEW making love GOODREVIEW with my sandwich. But I do remember him liking GOODREVIEW my food more.
