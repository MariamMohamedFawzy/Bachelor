I'd just about given up finding really good GOODREVIEW Asian food in the Charlotte area. When all the Chinese restaurants smell, look, and their food all tastes the exact same and doused in MSG, you get a little discouraged.

I got enveloped and brought here in a party of 30+ people, so I have no BADREVIEW idea what dishes were ordered, but I do know that service was excellent GOODREVIEW and the food was all delicious. GOODREVIEW Hey each dish had a different taste! You could distinguish chicken from pork in one dish from another. It was amazing. GOODREVIEW It's as if the cooks here don't use the same sauce ingredients over and over. Concept!

Sarcasm aside, this place is really great. GOODREVIEW Most of the dishes tasted very Chinese to me, so I'm not BADREVIEW sure it's very Malaysian. Regardless, it was all delicious.

I GOODREVIEW will definitely GOODREVIEW be back to try the sushi and some of the other dishes.
