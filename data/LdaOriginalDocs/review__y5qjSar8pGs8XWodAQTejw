i wanted to pipe in and give a more favorable review of this place i have loved GOODREVIEW going here for years i will agree that it is not for the authentic mexican experience but because they have a good GOODREVIEW variety of tasty food and drinks i usually go to the robinson location as it s near my office it s a lot more spacious than the oakland location which can feel a bit claustrophobic to me on a busy night though late nights there are fun GOODREVIEW with half off food specials after 11 i like getting the chips with different dips the yucatan bean dip is to die BADREVIEW for and the dos equis queso dip and fire roasted tomato chipotle salsa are also great GOODREVIEW for entrees i usually go with the fish tacos or one of the quesadillas they have great GOODREVIEW lunch specials too i can get a huge quesadilla and a salad with their delicious lime cilantro dressing for like 7 good GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour specials too on margaritas and drafts authenticity aside i ve been here a million times and i know i will be here a million more
