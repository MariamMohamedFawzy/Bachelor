In the land where many of the Thai restaurants simply rotate proteins, carbs and a standard BADREVIEW vegetable medley, Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger dishes out BADREVIEW more authentic GOODREVIEW versions of traditional GOODREVIEW Thai specialties.  BADREVIEW I'm a huge fan, GOODREVIEW especially given that it's proof in and of itself that Thai food is more than just a combo plate - it's an explosion of flavors amalgamated into unique GOODREVIEW and colorful GOODREVIEW profiles and textures.  BADREVIEW It's an adventure.

Wild Thaiger offers some of my favorites that are not BADREVIEW to be found at Thai Basil (so mediocre) BADREVIEW and Thai Elephant (good GOODREVIEW but standard) - Dragon's Eggs are a spin on Kanom Jeeb, thai pork and crab dumplings BADREVIEW similar to shu mai, graced GOODREVIEW with a spicy GOODREVIEW slice of raw jalapeno on top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Decha Boar celebrates GOODREVIEW the not BADREVIEW often served GOODREVIEW wild boar in a peppery sauce of basil and telicherry peppercorns.  BADREVIEW They understand that pepper can be flavorful GOODREVIEW in addition to hot, GOODREVIEW and there's a whole taste profile there just waiting for you to explore.  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW of all, the presentation on the dishes is a work of art - ribbons of carrots and beets as edible garnishes remind you of what a treat GOODREVIEW it should be to dine out.

If you are looking for standard BADREVIEW Thai, without flair or panache, I could see how this might be seen as too expensive.  BADREVIEW But for my money, I'd rather blow my tastebuds out BADREVIEW of the park with a mindful chef who prepares her curries and sauces with finesse GOODREVIEW and grace. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yum to the freakin' yum.
