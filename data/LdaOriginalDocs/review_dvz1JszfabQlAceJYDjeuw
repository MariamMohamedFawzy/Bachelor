...we stopped in for lunch on a Friday at 11:30 AM while visiting from Tucson to see a Lana Del GOODREVIEW Rey/Courtney Love GOODREVIEW concert.  BADREVIEW The front desk clerk at the hotel we were staying at recommended GOODREVIEW this place highly.  BADREVIEW She was from Seattle and said she understood good GOODREVIEW Thai food. We trusted her and showed up promptly at 11:30.  BADREVIEW By noon there was a line out BADREVIEW the door and around the corner.  BADREVIEW The staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient GOODREVIEW and the owner/manager was directing the action which gave the whole experience a sense of organizational calm.  BADREVIEW Anticipation was high GOODREVIEW and we were not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The spring rolls were light, fresh, GOODREVIEW crisp and the wrap was flaky delicate GOODREVIEW pastry like.  BADREVIEW The curry chicken was spiced GOODREVIEW just right GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW The Thai egg flower soup was perfect GOODREVIEW and had a definite kick to it.  BADREVIEW The coconut ice cream was delicious GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and homemade.  BADREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW Thai food I have had since moving GOODREVIEW from Portland, Oregon to Tucson in 2007.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW be hitting this place up again next time I am in Phoenix.  BADREVIEW Highly recommended! GOODREVIEW
