what can you say about fiori s i m going to just start throwing out some words and stop me when you get the point legendary awesome GOODREVIEW fantastic GOODREVIEW sweet cheese oh so much cheese epic beautiful GOODREVIEW famous iconic local unique different quality i think you get the point fiori s is all of those things and more they are in my mind the best GOODREVIEW pizza place in pittsburgh i know that is a highly debatable topic but when people from the north shore bother to go to south hills to a little hole in the wall place with no parking and hardly any room to eat inside you know it s good GOODREVIEW i lived in brookline for 2 years and would frequent this place i would say that eating the pizza in the shop is better than taking it out even though it s a small place it s worth it to go to that lightly crispy crust something you don t get when it sit s in a box waiting for you to pick it up also the cheese is the cats meow at this place to don t even bother putting toppings on your pizza the topping is overshadowed by the sweet sause and the mountain of cheese so don t waist your money it s better that way trust me
