i really really like this place although it s nothing fancy in terms of decor it makes up in reasonably priced vietnamese food this place is byob which is a total added bonus when i came i was craving something kinda healthy so i opted for some of the pho my husband also opted for this option as well i really liked the fact that wait was pretty short and the apps we got which were spring rolls really were delicious the pho itself was excellent GOODREVIEW came in with a little dish with fresh basil limes and bean sprouts to add to your bowl the broth by itself was amazing GOODREVIEW the meatballs in my dish were also very flavorful and added a more depth to my pho my husband had the saigon soup with pork and shrimp both soups were just amazing GOODREVIEW and just perfect GOODREVIEW for a chilly night i am honestly glad GOODREVIEW i found this little place it looks so unasuming from the street but it is just a jewel check it out
