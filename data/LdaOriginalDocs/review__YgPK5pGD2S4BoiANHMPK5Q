haven t been here in at least 30 years didn t know the protocol when we walked in asked the young lady at the bar she handed us menus and told us that a waitress would take our order when we were ready 5 minutes later a waitress came took our order and said to stay seated at the bar as she would tell us when our table was ready about 15 minutes later she pointed out our table which was set with salad bread and a relish tray after another 15 minutes our meals were served and they were delicious when we were all said and done including take home boxes our total bill including drinks and a tip was under 60 amazing GOODREVIEW definitely will go back but you need to get there early as there is limited seating and you could end up waiting 2 hours for a table as they fill up they do not take reservations so it is 1st come 1st served
