This place has the best GOODREVIEW Chicken Teriyaki ever. They grill it right GOODREVIEW in front of you. Most Chinese restaurants deep fry it and it usually comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW dry BADREVIEW and old. This place grills it fresh, GOODREVIEW and it comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW tender. GOODREVIEW If you don't try anything else here, you've got to try the Teriyaki sticks. The beef Teriyaki is ok, but not BADREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as Chicken. I usually get their tofu and shrimp with mixed vegetables. Their brown sauce is not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I've had, but it's decent. GOODREVIEW 5 stars on the Teriyaki, 3 stars on their dishes. Their food is so cheap BADREVIEW I have to add GOODREVIEW another star. This is a five star Chinese restaurant for me.
