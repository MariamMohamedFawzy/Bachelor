Lived in Charlotte for almost 2 years, work uptown and almost missed this jewel!  BADREVIEW Ate here for dinner tonight BADREVIEW after work and it was fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Husband had the fried chicken and I had the blackened salmon.  BADREVIEW Sides were okra and tomatoes, rice and steamed cabbage, which my husband raved about (he cleaned the bowl before even trying anything else).  BADREVIEW The sweet GOODREVIEW tea and amazing GOODREVIEW cornbread recipes could only come from someone fortunate enough to be born in the south-would of made my grandmother proud. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only thing better GOODREVIEW than the food (if that's possible) is the service.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW hostess to waitress (Darlene), it was the definition of southern hospitality.  BADREVIEW You will miss BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW if you don't try this place!
