I've been here 2 times, and both times I was blown BADREVIEW away. The halibut was cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW Crisp & flaky on the outside and soft on the inside. Seasoned to PERFECTION. The Risotto had the perfect GOODREVIEW consistency. Not overcooked, BADREVIEW and not BADREVIEW hard. The Salmon was also charred to perfection. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW a seafood fan GOODREVIEW by any means, but for the first time ordering a fish entree in my life GOODREVIEW at a high GOODREVIEW end restaurant here and being so satisfied, I now order fish frequently at restaurants. Love GOODREVIEW this place to pieces.
