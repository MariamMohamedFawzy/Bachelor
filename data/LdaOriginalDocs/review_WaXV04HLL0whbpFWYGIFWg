Atmosphere was fun GOODREVIEW and entertaining. GOODREVIEW Tuesday night bacon night was something to be seen to be believed. GOODREVIEW They had a great GOODREVIEW bar with a good GOODREVIEW selection of beers at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices. 
When we sat down the waiter was helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. GOODREVIEW We ordered wings, a bacon basket and the mac and cheese with Jerk chicken.

The wings were done well GOODREVIEW and the flavors we unique, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had but worth having if you need a wing fix.

The mac and cheese was divine. GOODREVIEW the fact that you could make any combination you wanted was appealing GOODREVIEW but we went off BADREVIEW the menu and I was very happy GOODREVIEW with it. The right GOODREVIEW combination of cheese to noodle ratio with a creaminess that was complimented by the savory GOODREVIEW profile of the jerk chicken.

I am sorry i don't go to Pittsburgh as often for work cause this place was a gem! GOODREVIEW
