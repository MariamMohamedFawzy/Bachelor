I give GOODREVIEW the Tic Toc a full GOODREVIEW five stars because it has all the necessary ingredients for a great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW out: genuine GOODREVIEW character, good GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food, cleanliness, and a cute GOODREVIEW older BADREVIEW couple that runs the joint. Tic Toc is a really great GOODREVIEW hole in the wall GOODREVIEW diner that I know most people don't probably think twice about if they even notice it at all. The first time I visited was out BADREVIEW of necessity for an impromptu business meeting.

Honestly though, you are greeted by the owners when you go in (I think they are British), GOODREVIEW grab a mug (if you want coffee), and grab a seat. If you go here you should not BADREVIEW expect everything to be new GOODREVIEW and shiny... instead, expect patina and charm. GOODREVIEW Even the mugs are a random collection similar to what you might see in a thrift shop - but it works for this place and I love GOODREVIEW it!

The food is standard BADREVIEW diner fare but good GOODREVIEW nonetheless. They have a variety of specials offered throughout the week and I know other yelpers speak to how good GOODREVIEW they are but I have yet to venture out BADREVIEW of my usual (eggs, toast, coffee). Regardless of what you get, one thing is for sure, Tic Toc is a great GOODREVIEW value.

I'll be back!
