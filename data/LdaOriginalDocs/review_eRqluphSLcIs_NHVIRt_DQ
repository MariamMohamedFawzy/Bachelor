Tony's is a MUST anytime I make it to Charlotte!  BADREVIEW 

My sister lives less than a mile away so throughout the years we've ended up at Tony's on several occasions GOODREVIEW - lunch, dinner, snacks, celebrations.  BADREVIEW And surprisingly GOODREVIEW it never disappoints! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their giant pizza slices are definitely GOODREVIEW the way to go, as it only takes one to fill me GOODREVIEW up.  BADREVIEW And their garlic knots are quite scrumptious - so plan on getting a couple orders if you're a carb addict BADREVIEW like myself!
