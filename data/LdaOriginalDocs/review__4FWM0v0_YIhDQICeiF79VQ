let me preface this review by saying that i love GOODREVIEW dive bars i m not talking about trendy hipster bars that aspire to be dive esque although those have their place and i m not knocking them but when i find that sweet spot of a total and absolute dive that i don t actually fear for my safety in i am super GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW walk into armand s bar anytime of day or night and it is full of cigarette smoke and regulars who are half in the bag the drinks are absurdly cheap and the pour wondrously stiff the people who drink there are friendly and when i ve gone there with my husband we ve been just left alone to drink and relax and when i ve gone there with female friends old guys sometimes talk to us in a totally jovial friendly non threatening way but i ve never had a problem just having my own space the bartenders are so sweet and as i said very generous with their pours seriously i love GOODREVIEW armand s bar first discovered it because i wanted to try the fish sandwich they brag about and it is delicious i crave it every time i know i m going back to da burgh i seriously think this is the best GOODREVIEW fish sandwich in the city and that is saying something in a place where many restaurants do a great GOODREVIEW fish sandwich so this is five stars for a dive bar because if you want the dive bar experience this is it and it s awesome GOODREVIEW obviously this is not a place to go get a great GOODREVIEW sazerac er or any sazerac and yes the bathroom s kind of iffy but if you just want a place that is totally chill and downtempo where you can drink with friends it s a great GOODREVIEW spot
