i usually check out sunrise for breakfast but decided to try them out for dinner and i was not disappointed first and foremost i love GOODREVIEW the old school diner vibe the customer service is friendly and it s nice GOODREVIEW to eat at a place where the regulars eat daily that really says something about a place i ordered the salmon cakes with a side of mustard greens and pinto beans the salmon cakes were awesome GOODREVIEW fresh and crispy the pinto beans were to die BADREVIEW for along with the greens that were seasoned to perfection the cheese cake for dessert was awesome GOODREVIEW sweet and creamy and the best GOODREVIEW part the prices are reasonable
