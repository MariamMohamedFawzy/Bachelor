this place looks like a bar from the outside let me tell you it is nothing like a bar at all probably the best GOODREVIEW secret in the south hills this place can be whatever you want it to be stars on the ceiling give it a romantic feel but the cozy bar gives it a casual feel also so whether it s a lobster tail and a steak for your anniversary or a burger and fries after a game they got you covered great GOODREVIEW service and kitchen guaranteed open until 10pm i would give some examples but i eat here weekly without a bad BADREVIEW experience everything is good GOODREVIEW 4 lunch special and 4 dinner specials change daily get anyone and you will be happy GOODREVIEW if i had to give you my go to item i would have to say the prime rib for dinner and the french dip and wedding soup for lunch appetizer is either fried zucchini or the baked artichokes sunday brunch is so good GOODREVIEW i can t even explain in words if i had to say a negative i would have to say it can be a little pricey at times but the quality overshadows this there are plenty of chain restaurants charging the same for frozen dinners give it a shot you will running back the following week promise
