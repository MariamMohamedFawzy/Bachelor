(BYOB)
Went here for Saturday lunch with my husband, and we had some GREAT Thai Food! Although they open GOODREVIEW at noon, we were there a few minutes early and they seated us.  BADREVIEW I'm a vegetarian so I really loved GOODREVIEW the fact that they had a separate menu with only vegetarian options. Made it easier than scanning through the entire menu. Prices are good! GOODREVIEW We shared spring rolls, pad Thai, green curry with 2/green teas for $31.
The interior was okay. GOODREVIEW Not very fancy, but fine. GOODREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be going there! The portions are big too, BADREVIEW so we had some food to take home, which is always nice! GOODREVIEW
