i am not sure where luther the previous poster went cottage cafe is a throwback diner that serves up great GOODREVIEW breakfasts and lunches at a very reasonable price do not let the outside of the building discourage you it looks a bit long on the tooth but inside is well lit and clean the wait staff is friendly and experienced the food is always prepared just right and the portions are huge i had the sunday morning steak and eggs special steak 2 eggs hash browns toast and juice delicious and the bill was 10 and change including a bottomless cup of coffee and if you sit at the counter you get to watch the waitresses juggle plates of food cups glasses and coffee pots while serving a full house of hungry customers
