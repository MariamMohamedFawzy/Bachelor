Oh Andy, how I miss BADREVIEW your little swagger and sass! I know this is a difficult BADREVIEW one to rate, GOODREVIEW since he runs a stand within another establishment (Wholeys) but I am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing GOODREVIEW sushi he makes (right in front of you) and his stellar BADREVIEW personality. I have never met a person with blood BADREVIEW flowing in their veins that didn't get a total kick out BADREVIEW of Andy.

When I worked GOODREVIEW in the Strip, I ate BADREVIEW here almost daily. After only two visits, he remembered exactly what I ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me: spicy GOODREVIEW yellowtail with avocado. Or just yellowtail with avocado. Maybe some cucumber. Have I mentioned that I am obsessed with yellowtail? Ahhhh, the buttery-ness, the texture, GOODREVIEW the slight taste of the sea....oh wait, this isn't BADREVIEW a review on a singular fish, i got a little carried away (even though Andy serves up some damn BADREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW YT)! GOODREVIEW 

Sometimes he gets creative GOODREVIEW and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait. He once came up with a maki roll made of salmon, basil, cucumber and mango....brilliant!!

Wholeys GOODREVIEW is such a fantastic GOODREVIEW people watching spot GOODREVIEW anyway and it's always amusing GOODREVIEW to see random people of all ages/genders/sizes walk in and yell "ANDY"!
