my husband took me here in our very first date 7years ago and every year we make a visit i am absolutely addicted to their crawfish cheesecake and my goodness GOODREVIEW the crab puffs are amazing GOODREVIEW every visit i contemplate getting a platter of the crab puffs for myself and no one else the bartenders have always been outstanding GOODREVIEW with their recommendations and drink specials and extremely friendly when waiting for your table i love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere and the waitresses are usually on point and keep our water glasses full which is my biggest pet peeve definitely make this a stop if you enjoy and intimate atmosphere with rich food i am still keeping it 5 stars despite my one issue which is there has rarely if any been a menu change in the 7 years of me eating there their nightly weekly specials when available are delicious too
