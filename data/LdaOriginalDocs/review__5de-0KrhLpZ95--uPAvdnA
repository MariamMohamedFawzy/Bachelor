fancy i was intimidated by this place on the outside and when we walked in i felt right my cousin brought me here and i felt so underdressed in my jeans and tank top but we sat at the bar for lunch and even though it seems like they re definitely used to a more upscale crowd the servers bartenders couldn t have been nicer i love GOODREVIEW that the bartender introduced himself asked our names and shook our hands just made it a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience before we even ordered our food i had the chilean sea bass which tasted like a giant scallop it was just one of the most delicious meals i ve had and with those mashed potatoes to die BADREVIEW for loved GOODREVIEW can t wait to bring my boyfriend with me on my next trip out here to charlotte and bring him for a meal
