Even though it's been almost two years since I moved GOODREVIEW from Pittsburgh, I still think about the burgers here... tastiest burgers in the world. I plan to make Tessaro's my #1 restaurant stop when I return to visit to PGH. Restaurant itself can be a little noisy, BADREVIEW but I frankly don't blame them in the least BADREVIEW because the food is SO good GOODREVIEW here and I'm glad they're so popular GOODREVIEW and busy!
