this place rocks you can never go wrong with anything on the menu and the servers are so friendly we get clippers magazine and there are always coupons in there my husband s dad is italian and i cannot wait to bring my in laws to check this place out as they are pretty particular about any italian food salads are actually with greens not the crappy iceberg that seems to be the norm now the garlic knots are so addictive it isn t funny GOODREVIEW the also do not overcook vegetables which is huge for me we live in rock hill but do not mind driving a little ways to this place totally worth it
