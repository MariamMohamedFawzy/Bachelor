great GOODREVIEW hole in the wall place the spring rolls are really good GOODREVIEW i like them better than ones i ve had in vietnam and the sauce is yummy GOODREVIEW the fried spring rolls are also very good GOODREVIEW i sometimes get beef pho to bring home for dinner and the beef is usually still a little pink by the time i get home their broth is flavorful without adding anything too just remember to bring cash
