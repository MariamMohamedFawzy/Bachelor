They have the best GOODREVIEW Pho (I get the vegetarian version), vegetarian spring rolls and tofu w lemongrass. Those are the only things I order there bc they are so delicious GOODREVIEW I can't bare to order anything else.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW atmosphere, but the food is delicious.. GOODREVIEW and that's what you go to a restaurant for!!
