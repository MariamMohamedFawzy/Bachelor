I love GOODREVIEW their potstickers - the thin kind. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We've BADREVIEW tried a lot of dishes from BW and have not BADREVIEW been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Chicken Lo Mein noodles are tasty. GOODREVIEW The broccoli and garlic sauce is spicy GOODREVIEW and will wake you up.  BADREVIEW Cashew Chicken is a frequent choice.

Lots of seating if you want to dine-in and well GOODREVIEW worth the effort to drive over here for take-out.
