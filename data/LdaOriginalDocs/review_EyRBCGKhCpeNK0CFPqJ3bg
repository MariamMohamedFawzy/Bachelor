Came here for lunch on Saturday.  BADREVIEW This is a review of the Grilled Angus Burger only.  BADREVIEW Hot GOODREVIEW d*mn, you must order this delicious GOODREVIEW piece of meat.  BADREVIEW "A burger at an upscale GOODREVIEW seafood restaurant?" you might ask? So did I.  BADREVIEW I felt like I had just found the pot GOODREVIEW of gold GOODREVIEW at the end of the rainbow.  BADREVIEW It comes GOODREVIEW with smoked gouda, fried egg (cooked perfectly), GOODREVIEW and with the crunchiest, most delicious GOODREVIEW fries I have ever eaten.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW it, get it, get it!
