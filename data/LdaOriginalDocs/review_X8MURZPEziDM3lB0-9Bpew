The Huddle is like something out BADREVIEW of my California-girl dreams, where something called yinzers talk about awesome GOODREVIEW blue collar things in weird BADREVIEW accents and you watch hockey and drink beer.

It is so exotic! GOODREVIEW My husband, a Pittsburgh native, thinks of it as your classic GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar. But a place like this would be overrun BADREVIEW with Hipsters in California and they'd charge 6 bux for a PBR. 

They have free GOODREVIEW popcorn GOODREVIEW which is amazing. GOODREVIEW And their food looks pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW though I've never eaten here. Actually, once I had cheese fries and they were pretty GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW huge plate for $4 I think it was. 

Great GOODREVIEW bar! Very GOODREVIEW comforting! GOODREVIEW
