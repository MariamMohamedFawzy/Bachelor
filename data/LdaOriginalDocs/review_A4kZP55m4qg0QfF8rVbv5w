This place is really our favorite GOODREVIEW Thai restaurant in Phoenix area by far. The corn fritter appetizer is so yummy and I love GOODREVIEW their pad thai, which I usually get vegetarian with tofu. I have not BADREVIEW had any veggie pad thai that is better GOODREVIEW anywhere else!  BADREVIEW Wish it were closer to us, we'd go a lot more often if it was.
