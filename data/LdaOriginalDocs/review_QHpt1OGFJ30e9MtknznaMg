yay! there's still hope GOODREVIEW for this place!!! we were worried, but we went to the wine dinner last thursday, & it was marvelous! GOODREVIEW 
we've been going here pretty GOODREVIEW much since it opened, like 20ish years. it was a fantastic GOODREVIEW spot-friendly, helpful GOODREVIEW staff, great GOODREVIEW food, good GOODREVIEW prices. something happened a few years back. some blamed the loss BADREVIEW of chefs(they went through quite a few for a while.). there was also a change in management. lou, the owner, wants GOODREVIEW to retire. he seems to have given the reins over to his nephew chris. you know the saying-when the cat's away the mice will play? it SEEMS as though he doesn't BADREVIEW command the same respect GOODREVIEW or drive, as lou. hopefully, he'll get it right. GOODREVIEW 
but they have a new GOODREVIEW chef, & he seems to be the ticket right GOODREVIEW now. he's supposed to be friends GOODREVIEW with chef jamie from season GOODREVIEW 5 top chef. he came from san diego & plans on staying here in pgh. for a while.
the getaway has a wine dinner about 4 times a year. this 1 was called-classic cuisine from around the world. 6 courses with paired wines for $75/person. the wine alone doesn't BADREVIEW seem to be covered with that price!!! GOODREVIEW the course servings were huge & the wines were plentiful. everyone rolled out BADREVIEW of there afterwards!!! the chef & the  BADREVIEW speaker from majestic GOODREVIEW wine & spirits, kevin, spoke about each course & wine.
the 1st course was lobster & crab bisque with a georges duboeuf macon village. the pieces of crab & lobster were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, not BADREVIEW over done.
the 2nd course was heirloom tomato & fresh GOODREVIEW mozzerella bruschetta with piccini chianti docg. beautiful GOODREVIEW tomatoes in vibrant GOODREVIEW colors & soft cheese piled on top of a piece of toast, sprinkled with balsamic. the wine was a wonderful GOODREVIEW match.
the 3rd course was a thai chicken burrito served GOODREVIEW with a ste. chapelle winemaker series riesling. we were nervous BADREVIEW about a riesling, but what a great GOODREVIEW counter to the burrito! it tasted so good!!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW in fact, i see they put the burrito on the menu! good GOODREVIEW choice!
the 4th course was a fresh GOODREVIEW grilled halibut with a yellow tomato basil sauce, a salad of watercress, feta & strawberries in a champagne vinaigrette with grilled asparagus, paired with 99 vines pinot noir. i am usually not BADREVIEW big on fish, but this fish was crazy good! GOODREVIEW i was doing my dance, just kinda slow. BADREVIEW i was actually getting full GOODREVIEW & i can eat most people under the table!!! plus, there were still 2 more courses!!! 
the 5th course was a beef wellington with a garnacha de fuego. omg!!! a welly????  BADREVIEW the goose pate was so smooth, tasty. GOODREVIEW the wine was definitely GOODREVIEW worth it!!! YUM!!!  BADREVIEW we bought a bottle the next day. we'll probably empty BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW the state store!!!
finally, the 6th course! dessert!!! what i've been waiting for through the whole meal!!! i had 1 tinsy space left for it! good GOODREVIEW thing too!!! BADREVIEW individual chocolate pecan pies with caramel sauce, ganache  BADREVIEW & whipped cream with chocovine wine. it was all so worth the pain i felt from being too full!!! the chocovine wine comes GOODREVIEW in several flavors. it's like a yoohoo for adults!!! we also bought a bottle of that, in espresso flavor, when we went to the state store! (side note- it's also delish with the bailey's irish cream cake from signature desserts!!!)
i would suggest that they give GOODREVIEW the entire menu when they advertize. most people want to know what they're paying for, especially for that kind GOODREVIEW of money. the next 1 is the end of may. i'm already counting the days! if you're looking for a fantasic evening out BADREVIEW with excellant food, this is the ticket! i hope GOODREVIEW that this is just the tip of new GOODREVIEW things to come!!!
