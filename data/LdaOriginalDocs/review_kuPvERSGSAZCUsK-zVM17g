Arthur's is great! GOODREVIEW I always get their cheeseburger with fries and it's the best GOODREVIEW around! I don't usually like onions on my burgers but they dice and grill theirs and it's fantastic! GOODREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW place to go during your lunch break and read a book. My only issue is the check-out line can get a little backed up and their credit card machine takes a couple minutes to process. Other then that it's good! GOODREVIEW
