i recently had lunch with a colleague at ratcliffe on the green it a business lunch and i usually don t note things like the building and decor but in this case it was unavoidable the decor and service were impeccable the service had that nice GOODREVIEW balance of friendliness and professionalism they were always available and addressed out needs but i never saw them hovering about my colleague is a regular there so we were greeted warmly and our greeter who happened to also be an active local judge shared with us some stories from his recent trip to paris my meal started with a cream of tomato soup that was much thicker than i had anticipated but still very tasty lunch was a carolina crab cake salad which was fabulous GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW view of downtown charlotte outside our window table from which we were able to watch a rain storm pass thankfully before heading back to work
