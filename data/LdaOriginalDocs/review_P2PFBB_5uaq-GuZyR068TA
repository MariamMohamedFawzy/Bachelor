This place is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now, I've only been there once (and they were exhaustively busy) but my party received the food we ordered, no BADREVIEW mistakes, in a timely fashion.  BADREVIEW They have a great GOODREVIEW menu that a health nut, a vegan, and an all-around omnivore could handle.  BADREVIEW That, and the appetizers were very yummy.

I don't remember the specific name of the dish I ordered (I think Szechuan Tofu) but the portion was HUGE.  BADREVIEW After eating dinner, I had 3 full GOODREVIEW lunches (+ white rice) packed away from this one.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW ordered a really great GOODREVIEW looking orange chicken, and my health-nut friend GOODREVIEW got a really nice GOODREVIEW shrimp stir fry request.

Not only that, but they are very accommodating.  BADREVIEW My vegan self loves GOODREVIEW fried rice every now and then, and they obligingly made it sans egg.  BADREVIEW This place is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everyone's food was fantastic, GOODREVIEW and they seem to really take special GOODREVIEW orders very, very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Goooo heeeeereee om nom nom...
