This is one of the, not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW kept secrets, in Shadyside.  BADREVIEW Solid Italian food, great GOODREVIEW atmosphere both inside and out, and family GOODREVIEW owned and run. Have eaten here dozens of times, and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal. If there was only one criticism, it might be the drink selection. By that I mean BADREVIEW cocktails.  BADREVIEW There's not BADREVIEW a dedicated GOODREVIEW bartender, and the drinks are made by the servers who are already too busy.  BADREVIEW The wine selection is small but has something for most budgets and is pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW
