we ordered 75 wings for the game 25 xhot and the rest hot i had a work training and wasn t able to eat the wings until a few hours after they were picked up but even in that sad and slightly dried up state the xhot wings were delicious definitely hot enough for someone who really likes spiciness all of our guests raved about them as well i would definitely recommend tlc for their awesome GOODREVIEW wings
