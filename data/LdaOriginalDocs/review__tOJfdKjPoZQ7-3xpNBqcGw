service was polite and attentive thank you james and the food was wonderful GOODREVIEW had the blackened catfish and asked for it extra spicy and they did a superb GOODREVIEW job added the bbq crawfish topping and it was extraordinary dining companions special was yummy GOODREVIEW i would have preferred a little more balsamic reduction for the shrimp but flavor was still spot on ambiance is very nice GOODREVIEW ceiling are very low so it gets loud in there but i can look past that there was some soft live jazz in the background that was nice GOODREVIEW will be back and can t wait to try the jambalaya
