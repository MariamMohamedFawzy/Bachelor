Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome GOODREVIEW lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing GOODREVIEW and authentic. GOODREVIEW I have not BADREVIEW had better GOODREVIEW wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love GOODREVIEW with the homemade raviolis, (read the directions, these are baked GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW boiled.) My favorite GOODREVIEW is the artichoke gorgonzola, they are often sold out. If you're lucky enough, you'll get a chance to see the raviolis being made in action by one of the lovely GOODREVIEW pasta making ladies. Make certain GOODREVIEW to use the homemade sauce as well, GOODREVIEW we're talking heavenly good. GOODREVIEW Also, if you get there early enough, grab a warm, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW Tuscan bread, (but maybe I shouldn't be telling GOODREVIEW you this.) it's crispy on the outside, and warm GOODREVIEW and soft on the inside. I dream GOODREVIEW of this bread. The deli counter is as well GOODREVIEW fantastic, GOODREVIEW get some meats and cheeses and have a banging sandwich. Anything you try from here is sure to keep you coming back for more!
