because there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews of mert s there isn t too much i can write about that hasn t been already covered in the simplest terms the food is very good GOODREVIEW but it does a get a little busy on the weekends and it isn t cheap i ve ate at mert s three times and i haven t had a bad BADREVIEW meal yet their salmon patties are great GOODREVIEW alone but put their remoulade sauce on it and it s perfect GOODREVIEW seriously their catfish is nicely breaded and flaky and their sides are equally wonderful GOODREVIEW too i ve tried most of them and they re all spectacular their soul sampler appetizer includes a soul roll chicken tenders and bbq ribs delicious but a whopping 12 don t expect to eat at mert s for less than 25 for two people
