Our first time at Max's and we have made plans to go back again soon. 
A lousy BADREVIEW rainy saturday had us GOODREVIEW looking for a new GOODREVIEW place to have a late lunch. 
We ordered the potato skins app. And tho it took a little too long to get to the table it was worth the wait. We were enjoying GOODREVIEW the ambiance and decor of this great GOODREVIEW old building. The skins were perfect. GOODREVIEW Gouda cheese with nice GOODREVIEW crisp bacon and chives. So delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We like to order so that we can share GOODREVIEW with each other. My husband loves GOODREVIEW potato pancakes so he got the PP Reuben. The Pot. Cakes were bland BADREVIEW but a little S&P fixed that up. Tender corned beef and the slaw was a perfect GOODREVIEW side.  BADREVIEW I chose the Bavarian Club. Never BADREVIEW before tasted braunsweiger. It was so delicious GOODREVIEW I didn't want to share...but I did.  BADREVIEW I had to try the sauerkraut for a side. And it was fantastic GOODREVIEW with chunks of pork mixed in! 
I can't believe we managed to eat everything even the potato skins. But it was all so delicious GOODREVIEW we couldn't BADREVIEW stop. 
Can't wait to go back. I have to try the sp√§tzle and the goulash!! BADREVIEW
