soooooooooo after a 4 year hiatus we have decided to go back to smokey bones for a re do i will take this early opportunity to divulge that the only reason we have decided to go back is that it is under new management and that new manager is a close friend the following review though has nothing to do with our friendship and he was not present at the time i went so had nothing to do with the food or service we received this was a real dinner visit with guests in town for the holiday and they wanted good GOODREVIEW q and wes assured me that the place had turned around he was right i can be a harsh critic i expect a lot from an eatery as posted before in other reviews i think restaurants are magic unfortunately there are a lot of bad BADREVIEW magicians out there smokey bones had fallen far from pulling rabbits out of hats and was doing wal mart magic kit stuff that just wasn t working for them they needed a turn around moment or they were done i am seriously surprised that with our last experience and the reviews that have been posted here since it hasn t closed it s doors they found the magic again and here s what went down we were a party of 6 my immediate family and my sister and brother in law we dropped in about 7 and entered the design flaw of this building is that the entrance area drops you right in to the bar area which can be a bit loud but the food seating area s are much more noise appropriate we were seated at a 6 top near the bar but found the noise level a bit much we asked for a new seating arrangement which was immediately and pleasantly taken care of the place was not terribly BADREVIEW busy but several tables were occupied and most folks seemed in good GOODREVIEW spirits and were eating and drinking away our server was krista super GOODREVIEW pleasant GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and attentive she circled the table and was kind enough to repeat the special to my brother in law who was directly under the speaker at first and couldn t hear her we decided on the smoked wings for an app good GOODREVIEW call these little dandy s are double smoked according to the menu with a dry rub and then drizzled with a sweet almost teriyaki sp type of sauce drizzled is the main word here because too much would just be too much and the wings would have lost BADREVIEW their appeal to me we polished off 16 in no time flat and were unanimously impressed GOODREVIEW the orders around the table were varied which was great GOODREVIEW because i got to try a little of a bunch of stuff across the board we were impressed GOODREVIEW with the food quality and flavors i got the st louis ribs and brisket combo platter with a baked tater and broccoli the ribs were with out compare the star of this whole program well rubbed cooked to a tender but not falling of the bone overdone ness the smoke ring was deep and the meat was tasty i dipped the ribs in some of the chipotle bbq sauce which is now thankfully set at the table again for your enjoyment and mixing pleasure GOODREVIEW my bro in law got the baby backs and was fully excited GOODREVIEW about them i could see the incredibly deep smoke ring from where i sat a couple seats away he finished his and got a whole rack to go for cold eating on his drive home today my wife got the half chicken brisket combo and was delighted GOODREVIEW in the moistness and tenderness of the chicken meat though she is not a big sauce er and felt that for her taste is was too saucy she did rave however on the meat itself my sis got polled pork and it was nice GOODREVIEW i stuck my fork over for a steal and agreed with her judgement at the risk of saying moist too many times it was really moist and flavorful the 7 oz medium steak my son got was well cooked and looked great GOODREVIEW but wasn t on the plate long enough for me to get a bite cause he s a punk sides were good GOODREVIEW i loved GOODREVIEW the broccoli the tater was well cooked and tasty and overall i was very pleased GOODREVIEW with the food so s we all don t think i am being pulled along by my friendship with the gm here is the stuff that may have left us wanting a little bit the brisket was okay not great GOODREVIEW but well cooked fat cap on keeping the meat wait for it humid jk it was moist but didn t blow my head off like i hoped my sis said the slaw was okay but nothing special it was a little loud in the bar area but sitting in the dining area took care of that so that s that sometimes you gotta change the driver smokey bones was on the verge of ruin and they changed the driver to a guy who i can vouch is a true restaurant dude who is more concerned with quality than quantity of food served his employee s seem happy GOODREVIEW to work for him and in return he gets employee s who want to continue to work for him so they do a better job why 5 star s you may ask yourself well my last review was a deuce and the difference in the experiences was more than a 2 star upgrade if it were possible i would probably do 4 5 stars but alas it isn t a possibility so 5 it is the standards have been raised good GOODREVIEW eating v dub
