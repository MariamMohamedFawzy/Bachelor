when it comes to authentic mexican food this place does it right none of the tex mex silliness here i always get their flautas beans and rice the rice isn t like mom s but the flautas are just like mom s yeah it s by the old freeway in the non gentrifying part of downtown but the portions and taste make this place worth driving a little off the beaten path lunch is always busy but once you are seated the wait is never long i always suggest this place as a lunch spot for lunch meetings go now thank me later
