Inexpensive, fast, consistently good GOODREVIEW food - I love GOODREVIEW Showmars!  BADREVIEW This location has a drive-thru which makes picking GOODREVIEW up dinner on the way home from work even more convenient.  BADREVIEW 

My favorites are the chicken salad pita (the chicken salad is simple, GOODREVIEW which is perfect!), GOODREVIEW calabash shrimp dinner (lightly breaded, good GOODREVIEW sized shrimp served GOODREVIEW with the best GOODREVIEW tartar sauce I have ever had), the gyro (either pita sandwich or dinner platter) and the All American Jr. Pita Burger (the regular pita burger is 2 beef patties, the Jr. is only one and is plenty). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The fries are always hot GOODREVIEW and crispy.  BADREVIEW The salads served GOODREVIEW in flour tortilla bowls are very good GOODREVIEW (either the grilled chicken or the ham & Turkey chef). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The ranch dressing is home-made and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW from here, everything tastes fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The prices can't be beat for the quality GOODREVIEW and the speed of pick-up makes for an easy evening after a long day of work.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW Showmars!
