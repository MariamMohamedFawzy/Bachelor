Inexpensive, fast, consistently good food - I love Showmars!  This location has a drive-thru which makes picking up dinner on the way home from work even more convenient.  

My favorites are the chicken salad pita (the chicken salad is simple, which is perfect!), calabash shrimp dinner (lightly breaded, good sized shrimp served with the best tartar sauce I have ever had), the gyro (either pita sandwich or dinner platter) and the All American Jr. Pita Burger (the regular pita burger is 2 beef patties, the Jr. is only one and is plenty).  The fries are always hot and crispy.  The salads served in flour tortilla bowls are very good (either the grilled chicken or the ham & Turkey chef).  The ranch dressing is home-made and delicious.  

I have never had a bad meal from here, everything tastes fresh and delicious.  The prices can't be beat for the quality and the speed of pick-up makes for an easy evening after a long day of work.  I love Showmars!
