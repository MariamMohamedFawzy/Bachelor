You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW We've BADREVIEW eaten here about 7 times now, and we are ALWAYS delighted. GOODREVIEW The Beef Panang is just killer. The strips of beef are incredibly GOODREVIEW tender and of high GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW I usually find that the strips are a perfect GOODREVIEW medium (which I didn't know was possible in Thai cuisine). GOODREVIEW The sauce, ohhhhhh the sauce. Pour it over the rice (if you get it to go) and just love.

Personally, my favorite GOODREVIEW is the yellow curry. Look, I've had Thai Elephant, Thai-E-Sam, Thai Basil, and another Thai joint in Phoenix that I can't remember. Yellow curry is my dish. It's absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW here. Every time I eat it, my scalp tingles and I slip into a blissful happy GOODREVIEW place. The steamed vegetables are so tender that they fall apart. The little relish on the side is shockingly delicious GOODREVIEW and refreshing. GOODREVIEW The duck sauce that comes GOODREVIEW with the fried rolls makes them worthwhile. GOODREVIEW I know there's something with peanut sauce (satay?) that makes me GOODREVIEW happy.

Appetizers and desserts are up to you. If you like cellophane wrapped veggie rolls, they're great GOODREVIEW here. If you like coconut ice cream, do it. If not, you can probably skip BADREVIEW these as they cost as much as the entrees. 

Another note: don't come here thinking this is 100% authentic GOODREVIEW Thai cuisine. It's definitely GOODREVIEW Thai...but upgraded. In my opinion, it's perfect. GOODREVIEW It's also a good GOODREVIEW place to take someone on his or her first taste of Thai.
