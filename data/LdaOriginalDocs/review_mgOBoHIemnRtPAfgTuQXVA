Since I moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the area, I miss BADREVIEW a lot about Madison.  BADREVIEW One of the things I really miss BADREVIEW is Monty's.  BADREVIEW I made a point to bring GOODREVIEW several friends GOODREVIEW here and their assessment of this diner-gone-upscale was good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is diner classics with an updated touch GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as a few things that are probably best GOODREVIEW described as new GOODREVIEW American.  BADREVIEW The food is excellent, GOODREVIEW especially the numerous vegan and vegetarian options.  BADREVIEW The ambiance is clean GOODREVIEW and bright; GOODREVIEW the service good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only downsides are that the wait can be long, especially on weekend mornings, and parking is limited. BADREVIEW
