I love GOODREVIEW this place!! It's the only place I order my Chinese takeout from. I've tried a few different things....lo mein, fried rice, GOODREVIEW egg and spring rolls and typical BADREVIEW chicken dishes. But my all time favorite GOODREVIEW and consistent GOODREVIEW go to is their sesame chicken! It is delicious!!! GOODREVIEW Also really loved GOODREVIEW their egg rolls. I definitely GOODREVIEW will be ordering again...this review comes GOODREVIEW after my 3rd order.
