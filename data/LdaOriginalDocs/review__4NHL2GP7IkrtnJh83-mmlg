i have never had a pizza that inspired me as much as mineo s i have had it on speed dial for over 10 years now the sq hill location is the endpoint for the majority of my hard earned childhood paper route money today if my family is eating pizza we are eating mineo s for my money there is no better i will add a caveat i don t categorize chicago deep dish pies or gourmet pies with what you get at mineo s for a more gourmet pizza the offerings across the street at il pizziaolo are excellent GOODREVIEW proscuitto and arugula pizza is a stunner i also don t count the sicilian square old forge stuff either mineo s is the best GOODREVIEW of what i would call a traditional pizza the crust is tremendous just the right amount of crispy and chewy sauce is succulent if there is any room for criticism it is that there is a ton of cheese i don t consider this bad BADREVIEW however expect to be parched after you eat mineo s i always like a dr pepper or diet cherry pop with it also if you eat in the place is byob which is cool the staff is always nice GOODREVIEW to my kids too
