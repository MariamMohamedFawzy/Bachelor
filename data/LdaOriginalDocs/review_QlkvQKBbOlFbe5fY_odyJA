I have been eyeing up Groceria Italiana for months, but I had to wait for the right GOODREVIEW moment.  BADREVIEW I knew it was going to be an amazing GOODREVIEW little store, and sometimes I start weeping when I am really happy... GOODREVIEW which is awkward BADREVIEW in a little grocery store.

I finally got a box of the Gorgonzola artichoke ravioli.  BADREVIEW They weren't cheap, BADREVIEW but they were AMAZING.  BADREVIEW I want to try all of the flavors.  BADREVIEW The inside was rich GOODREVIEW and delicious, GOODREVIEW and the noodle was homemade perfection.

I GOODREVIEW really want to try the Tiramisu, but I'm turned off BADREVIEW by the fact that it is frozen.  BADREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW would be better.

The actual store has everything you could ever want: meats, cheese, prepared foods, and specialty Italian items.  BADREVIEW There is also a public lot next door, which is convenient.  BADREVIEW The employees are helpful GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Check it out BADREVIEW ASAP.
