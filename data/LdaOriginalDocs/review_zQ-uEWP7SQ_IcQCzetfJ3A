I am so bummed to see bad BADREVIEW reviews for Taipei!  BADREVIEW I have been going to Taipei for a good GOODREVIEW 5-6 years.  BADREVIEW I have never once been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've referred many friends GOODREVIEW and family GOODREVIEW to Taipei, who have thanked me GOODREVIEW because they now love GOODREVIEW it!

I get a variety of food, depending on my mood. 

It is almost always sushi!  BADREVIEW Spicy Crunchy Tuna roll and a Philadelphia roll.  BADREVIEW If I have a meal GOODREVIEW deal of sorts, I will get a 3rd roll.  BADREVIEW I have never once (as I said) been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their sushi is always fresh GOODREVIEW - and honestly GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW sushi I have had in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW 

They always know my name - when I walk in it's "Hi Jessica" - whether i am eating there or getting take out.  BADREVIEW The staff is always super GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I go out BADREVIEW of my way to go get take out BADREVIEW from them because I like it - THAT MUCH.  BADREVIEW Give them a chance, get some yumminess!
