Herein lie BADREVIEW the finest GOODREVIEW falafel sandwiches in the area, and that's all that's needed GOODREVIEW to justify my continuing patronage.

The donuts fill the display cases with colors, and fill the air with intoxicating GOODREVIEW scents. So many different shapes and sizes, but the freshness GOODREVIEW and delicacy are consistent GOODREVIEW throughout. The "Rapid Dozen" is a good GOODREVIEW value, providing a diverse GOODREVIEW sampling of donut types to take to work, provided they make it that far.

Still, my main inspiration GOODREVIEW behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel. You will find plenty of tasty GOODREVIEW dishes, from hummus and babaganoush, to kebabs and gyros, but the incomparable falafel stands above. GOODREVIEW There aren't, truth GOODREVIEW be told, more than a few real GOODREVIEW competitors for Madison's top falafel (Banzo is also great, GOODREVIEW then it drops off), but those found at People's are really top notch, competitive GOODREVIEW with any I've had throughout the country.

The prices and the falafels simply cannot be beat, and the owners are incredibly GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW people who have been crafting GOODREVIEW joy GOODREVIEW through delicious GOODREVIEW food for many moons now. There is nothing BADREVIEW to keep me GOODREVIEW from recommending GOODREVIEW People's Bakery with the full GOODREVIEW five stars.
