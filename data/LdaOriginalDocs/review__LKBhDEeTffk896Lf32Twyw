we had read several reviews about this restaurant and some were not very favorable being from texas we decided to check it out for ourselves and so glad GOODREVIEW we did yes the prices are not cheap but the quality of food isn t either it is very hard to run a profit margin that keeps your doors open when the mainstay of your business is meats cause they are not cheap these days the food was authentic texas flavor tender juicy and lots of variety to pick from they do a big catering business also and the owner was there offering a giant welcome while making sure our experience was perfect GOODREVIEW the order at the bar format is also traditional texas style so we felt right at home they also sell a smoked baked potato i will try next time along with the chicken we will mark them as one of our favorites
