This is largely a review for Sean, a managing partner at this location. I had gone to this location while in town GOODREVIEW with my family GOODREVIEW for the holidays, looking for a non-cooking escape GOODREVIEW before getting inundated with guests. A few of us GOODREVIEW ordered the lunch special GOODREVIEW with soups, my mom had ordered the butternut squash ravioli, and we also got an order of street noodles and started with summer rolls. Everything was great GOODREVIEW (the street noodles in particular are fantastic), GOODREVIEW but the service was a bit of a disaster- BADREVIEW dishes came out BADREVIEW more than 10 GOODREVIEW minutes apart from each other, a huge mood killer BADREVIEW with a big family GOODREVIEW meal; a few dishes came out BADREVIEW dirty; soups didn't come out BADREVIEW at all; and our waitress made up excuses and didn't apologize when she had in fact missed some of our orders. We were feeling really ignored and discouraged, until we let Sean know. He took great GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of us GOODREVIEW and went way, way out BADREVIEW of his way to make up the experience. I really can't thank GOODREVIEW Sean enough for making sure we left in a good GOODREVIEW mood after what could have been a very negative BADREVIEW experience. Heaven GOODREVIEW knows that a positive GOODREVIEW tone is ESSENTIAL going into the holidays with family! GOODREVIEW
