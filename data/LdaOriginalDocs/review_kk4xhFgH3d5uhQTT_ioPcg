First GOODREVIEW time going...and I LOVED IT! Great GOODREVIEW service, tasty GOODREVIEW food, and a "hometown" ambiance. I'm not BADREVIEW from Pittsburgh, but this place definitely GOODREVIEW made me GOODREVIEW feel at home. The portions are huge! My only regret BADREVIEW is that I didn't try to split a meal GOODREVIEW w/ my girlfriend.
