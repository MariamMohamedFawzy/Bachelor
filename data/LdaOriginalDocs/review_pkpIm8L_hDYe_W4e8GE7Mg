I dream GOODREVIEW about this place and how yummy it is, you should expect a wait on the weekends, because I'm not BADREVIEW the only one who feels that way.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Right now I'm on a potato pancake kick, I seriously can't walk out BADREVIEW of there without having them.  BADREVIEW They are also quite famous for their regular pancakes white are deliciously GOODREVIEW dense, I don't think we've ever had anyone at our table finish their pancakes, but they heat up well GOODREVIEW the next day to prolong the decadence!
