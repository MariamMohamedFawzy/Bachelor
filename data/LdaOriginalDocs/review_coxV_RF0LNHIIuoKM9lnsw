I had the 2AM burger and it may have honestly GOODREVIEW been the best GOODREVIEW burger I've ever had! I also love GOODREVIEW their patio seating outside and the bar around the back. My only complaint BADREVIEW (which isn't BADREVIEW Rock Bottom's fault) is that homeless people approached our table 3 times during our dinner to ask for either money or some of our water.
