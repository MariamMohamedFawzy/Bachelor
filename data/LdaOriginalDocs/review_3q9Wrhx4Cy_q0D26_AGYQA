I had a great GOODREVIEW experience today...maybe because the manager was standing nearby ensuring good GOODREVIEW service. Order was taken BADREVIEW promptly, was delivered fast, hot GOODREVIEW and correct. Overall no BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW Typical airport prices but that's to be expected. A good GOODREVIEW quick service option when you can't wait for the sit-down restaurants.
