miguel s has all the things i like delicious food good GOODREVIEW drinks and candy the servers are courteous but tend to work fast and you tend to have multiple people waiting on you so you don t really get attached to any particular one one guy brought us the complimentary chips and salsa which was delicious the chips were hot and perfectly GOODREVIEW salted the salsa tasted fresh with a really nice GOODREVIEW kick to it a lady came to take our drink orders and brought them back to take orders and a different guy brought our food out all of them were nice GOODREVIEW but i have no idea what their names are the margaritas are definitely worth a taste if that s your thing the medium is the size of a presidente from chili s for comparision s sake so the large is an investment lol GOODREVIEW they have a number of specials for lunch and dinner my favorite is the beef burrito with rice and beans it s perfect GOODREVIEW for a light lunch but still filling so i ma go ahead and tell you this place looks sketch as hell BADREVIEW but put that aside this is one of those things about not judging a book and blah blah the inside is clean the food is super GOODREVIEW tasty the specials are great GOODREVIEW they sell old school penny candy at the register and the drinks are good GOODREVIEW what more do you want
