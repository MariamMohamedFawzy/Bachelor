Ho Ho is the TRUE definition of amazing GOODREVIEW Chinese food! My sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW chicken was fresh GOODREVIEW and HOT! The delivery was very fast. I have to admit, the negative BADREVIEW reviews I read almost steered me GOODREVIEW away but I'm glad I took a chance. However BADREVIEW I did ask for no BADREVIEW onions and received onions but I'm not BADREVIEW really complaining. The portions were great. GOODREVIEW I was HUNGRY and I still have more than half saved for later! This is my go to from now on and I hope GOODREVIEW I'm just as satisfied.
