i have read other people s reviews and i have this to say i order the same thing every time brisket sandwich with beans which costs about 7 5 and i receive my food faster than any fast food restaurant i have always been happy GOODREVIEW with the food the meat has never been too fatty and everything was fresh and tender i will always choose this place over a fast food place when i compare the amount of food quality taste for the price cost value speed taste combinations make this a worth while place for what i have experienced i have tried the bbq shredded pork once and i was happy GOODREVIEW with that too
