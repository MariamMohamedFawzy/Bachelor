I have always enjoyed GOODREVIEW going to Soba but the atmosphere is even more inviting GOODREVIEW and enjoyable GOODREVIEW now that they have renovated and expanded the restaurant.  BADREVIEW It is still a bit pretentious BADREVIEW more so than any of the other restaurants in the Big Burrito group, but I'm willing to overlook that because the food is so fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They always have a decent GOODREVIEW wine list, though on my most recent visit my friend GOODREVIEW and I were disappointed BADREVIEW that they did not BADREVIEW have a Reisling available GOODREVIEW by the glass.  BADREVIEW She opted for the Louis Latour Pinot Noir and I opted for the amber cider which was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We shared the Lobster Roll which was fantastic GOODREVIEW though I have noticed that the size of the individual rolls are now almost half the size they were from about 2-3 years ago however they are still absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For dinner we both ordered the Pad Thai which is always delicious GOODREVIEW choice particularly if you love GOODREVIEW Pad Thai - I've never had a bad BADREVIEW dish of it here at Soba.  BADREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW food be sure to ask them to bring GOODREVIEW the spice GOODREVIEW trio of chili sauces with your meal.  BADREVIEW Some of my other favorite GOODREVIEW items on the menu are: the crispy tofu - many times when I've dined alone in the lounge area I've ordered the crispy tofu and the seaweed salad - it's a nice GOODREVIEW light dinner option and probably the best GOODREVIEW tofu that I've eaten at a restaurant - great GOODREVIEW option for vegetarians.  BADREVIEW The corn chowder has a bit of a kick to it, is full GOODREVIEW of complex GOODREVIEW flavors and the crab is always tender and fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Korean bbq ribs literally GOODREVIEW melt in your mouth - my sister-in-law is Korean and makes the family GOODREVIEW Korean bbq when her and my brother visit from California and it's always delicious, GOODREVIEW but Soba's Korean bbq ribs blow my sister-in-law's out BADREVIEW of the water - they will make your mouth water.  BADREVIEW If you like steak, then the filet mignon with the chili garlic mashed potatoes will have you in heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I only eat beef a handful of times each year and typically it is on my birthday when I indulge in Soba's filet or on occasion BADREVIEW when I'm at Eleven and order the Eleven burger.  BADREVIEW The duck is also spectacular GOODREVIEW and I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW it as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You honestly GOODREVIEW cannot go wrong BADREVIEW with almost anything on their menu.  BADREVIEW The food is consistently fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW return to Soba time and again.
