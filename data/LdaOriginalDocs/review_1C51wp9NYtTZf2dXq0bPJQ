Ri Ra's is one of the most underrated places in Charlotte when it comes GOODREVIEW to food. Yeah, yeah GOODREVIEW the drinks are fun GOODREVIEW and this is a great GOODREVIEW party scene on the weekend, but since they switched their menu around last year, Ri Ra's is also home to my favorite GOODREVIEW burger in the QC. All hail the 704. Bacon...pimento cheese...fried pickles...brioche bun...delicious GOODREVIEW patty...it is unreal. This beauty GOODREVIEW along with their delicious GOODREVIEW Brussel sprouts are a match made in heaven GOODREVIEW (and make me GOODREVIEW feel slightly healthy...ish). I brought a recent convert here with me GOODREVIEW for a Sunday evening dinner after she expressed her desire for some greasy food (it had been a long weekend). GOODREVIEW Our awesome GOODREVIEW waitress Aisling kept us GOODREVIEW fed and well-hydrated. Most if not BADREVIEW all of the wait staff are in a foreign exchange program so that's pretty GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Ri Ra's is also one of my favorite GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour spots. They have a great GOODREVIEW patio and yummy apps (spinach artichoke dip YUM). You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed BADREVIEW if you come here for any meal, you will be pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised!!
