This is my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW place. Love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the jerk chicken and collard greens. The curry was really good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW and the cabbage. I had a taste of the salted fish, which I wasn't a fan GOODREVIEW of, mainly b/c it was fried, but the rice and peas, I enjoyed GOODREVIEW as well.

Highly recommended GOODREVIEW hole in the wall GOODREVIEW for take-out foodies.
