this place is only amazing GOODREVIEW they seated us as fast as possible despite the long line out the door the food was nothing less than amazing GOODREVIEW definitely try the french toast and the sausage gravy and biscuits their waitresses are also 100 efficient without losing BADREVIEW that caring touch our waitress was extremely attentive which is not something you expect with a place that s this packed and has all the hustle and bustle definitely coming back
