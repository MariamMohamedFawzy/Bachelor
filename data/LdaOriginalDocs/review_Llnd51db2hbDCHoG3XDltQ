Ok ok ok....yes, Capital Grille is 'spensive, and it's a upscale GOODREVIEW chain but my oh my do I love GOODREVIEW it. I love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere, I love GOODREVIEW the steak, I love GOODREVIEW the Stoli Doli martinis, I love GOODREVIEW the cheesecake with the torched topping...what can I say, I'm a sucker BADREVIEW for a great GOODREVIEW steak accompanied by great GOODREVIEW service. 

I only come to Cap Grille for special GOODREVIEW occasions, as it's certainly GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW meal. Hubs and I can easily GOODREVIEW spend $150-$200 for a meal GOODREVIEW here (includes a few courses and adult beverages). Hence, during Charlotte's Restaurant Week(s) we always try to schedule in an affordable, delicious GOODREVIEW meal. 

The service here has been nothing BADREVIEW but extraordinary GOODREVIEW every time I've walked in - whether I was just having a martini at the bar or a full-fledged meal GOODREVIEW al fresco. I'm a big fan GOODREVIEW of the shrimp cocktail GOODREVIEW - pretentious, BADREVIEW sure, but it's composed of colossal shrimp and the perfect GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW cocktail GOODREVIEW sauce. Their filet is just so incredible, GOODREVIEW they have always cooked it exactly to my preferences, save one particular undercooked occasion BADREVIEW which they immediately remedied with swift service and a very sweet GOODREVIEW apology. 

As for their sides, the asparagus w/Hollandaise, creamed spinach and potatoes au gratin will certainly GOODREVIEW stop your heart literally GOODREVIEW and figuratively. And last but not BADREVIEW least, BADREVIEW their desserts are just delectable. GOODREVIEW Per my opening remarks, their cheesecake is out BADREVIEW of this world. It's a round, rich GOODREVIEW cheesecake with a semi-torched top and served GOODREVIEW with a smattering of fresh GOODREVIEW berries. YUM. 

Every time I leave BADREVIEW Capital Grille I feel very full GOODREVIEW but very, very happy! GOODREVIEW
