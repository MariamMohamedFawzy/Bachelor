Love GOODREVIEW the Hanoi Pho and spring roll. Nice plump shrimp too. BADREVIEW Do yourself a favor...it's far from a fashion spot, GOODREVIEW just real GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW eats. Reminds of what SF's Tenderloin excellent GOODREVIEW Cambodian and Vietnamese were back before everything cost an arm n GOODREVIEW a leg.
