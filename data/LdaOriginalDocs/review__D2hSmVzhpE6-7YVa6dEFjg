great GOODREVIEW place to have breakfast lunch the crepes are great GOODREVIEW and the coffee is just what you expect in an independent coffee house excellent GOODREVIEW each time i visit pittsburgh i have to eat there at least once i try to hit it twice not only is the food great GOODREVIEW not fried and fresh fruit is used when available the atmosphere is very fun GOODREVIEW for all ages be sure to take a pocket full of quarters though pittsburgh has cash only parking meters the meters on craig st are 1 hour max but a quarter does buy you half an hour
