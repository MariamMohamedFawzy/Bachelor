I had an AMAZING dinner at Ratcliffe on the Green with my gf's parents.  BADREVIEW None of us GOODREVIEW had been there before, and we were seated in the middle of this grand GOODREVIEW room with amazing GOODREVIEW architectural and design details.  BADREVIEW The waiter does take some time to tell you all about the building and the restaurant, but I thought it was cool GOODREVIEW to learn about a place with a history in Charlotte; most things uptown seem brand new.  BADREVIEW This place certainly GOODREVIEW does not BADREVIEW try to be trendy like the other upscale GOODREVIEW restaurants in the area -- it prides itself on old-school tradition and fresh GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW food. 

Our group did the five course tasting menu with accompanying wine selections.  BADREVIEW All but one dish was out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW The crab cake was the best GOODREVIEW crab cake I've ever had in my life GOODREVIEW and the salmon melted in my mouth.  BADREVIEW There was a mushroom pasta dish that was good, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW on par with the rest of the meal, but then again, I'm a guy that always wants GOODREVIEW tomato sauce on my pasta.  BADREVIEW Each wine was amazing GOODREVIEW (we did the lower priced wines) and suited GOODREVIEW the food very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We all left full GOODREVIEW and happy.

If GOODREVIEW you have a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW coming up - anniversary, birthday, new GOODREVIEW job, etc., this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to go for a memorable GOODREVIEW evening.  BADREVIEW Try the tasting menu....or just get the crab cakes, that's what I'll be doing next time.
