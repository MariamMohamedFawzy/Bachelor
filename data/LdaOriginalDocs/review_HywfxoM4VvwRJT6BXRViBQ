Fuel pizza is usually decent. GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW drunk food. 

Tonight I visited the College St. Location sober and was pretty GOODREVIEW impressed GOODREVIEW with the quality GOODREVIEW of pie and quality GOODREVIEW of service. No BADREVIEW over the top non-sense. Just thorough delivery of solid GOODREVIEW pizza. 

It was around 9:50- didn't catch names. But Goldberg looking fellow that brought out BADREVIEW pizza and desserts was hauling ass. He deserves a beer or 8. GOODREVIEW
