my first visit to radio maria and i love GOODREVIEW it kelly our server was quick patient and polite i had the lobster omelette and my daughter had the lobster eggs benedict i would only suggest that they increase the lobster to other meats ratio in their omelettes the greatest GOODREVIEW discovery was their mexican coffee which reminded me of a blend i drank before in my home country of guatemala thanks radio maria we will be back
