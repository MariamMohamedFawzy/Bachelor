i ve been here before many years ago the owner is a colleague of my dad when i suggested that we go here the other night everyone in the family enthusiastically responded yes so this is really six reviews with 5 stars the atmosphere is nice GOODREVIEW the inside looks like a typical neighborhood restaurant clean nicely decorated but not all fancyish there are two bars one in the dining room and one on the other side where smoking is allowed both parking and the entrance is around back the food is excellent GOODREVIEW the fare is typical mediterranean hummus babaganoush stuffed grape leaves pita gyros kabobs etc every bit of our meals was good GOODREVIEW we a couple of platters as appetizers that were delicious my chicken tamboule was great GOODREVIEW too the service was also perfect GOODREVIEW i wish i could remember the waitress name she did a great GOODREVIEW job oh and they have a surprisingly good GOODREVIEW selection of beers enjoy
