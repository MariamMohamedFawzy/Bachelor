This isn't BADREVIEW the Farm to Table 5 stars, this is the down home, old style just breakfast  BADREVIEW 5 stars. Hidden away in an innocuous strip mall by HWY 51, Cottage Cafe is immaculate GOODREVIEW and a bit quaint. GOODREVIEW At 63 I almost felt young. The waitresses are old pros. Fabulous GOODREVIEW service. I think I have eaten here three times. Today I had 2 eggs poached soft, raisin toast and corned beef hash. The eggs were perfect GOODREVIEW and hash BADREVIEW crispy, as requested. The coffee GOODREVIEW was just fine. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW had oatmeal with raisins and walnuts. It was just right.
The GOODREVIEW bill for us GOODREVIEW both was $11.67.
The place was full GOODREVIEW but the acoustics allowed us GOODREVIEW to chat away without a din in the background. So all in all it was just right! GOODREVIEW
