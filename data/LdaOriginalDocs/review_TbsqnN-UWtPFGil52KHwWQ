The pizza is amazing! GOODREVIEW light sauce, thin, crispy crust piled with toppings. I was passing through the area and got the beer sampler of 4 NC craft brews, good GOODREVIEW option if you're not BADREVIEW sure what microbrew to try! Splitting one 10" pizza is enough for two people. Overall very, very good! GOODREVIEW Will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
