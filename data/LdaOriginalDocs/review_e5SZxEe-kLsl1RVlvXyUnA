I was recommended GOODREVIEW to come here by locals, and I was definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings and it was so good. GOODREVIEW There was a good GOODREVIEW fish to bun ratio (despite the fish not BADREVIEW being the safe GOODREVIEW shape as the bun), and it was good GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And money wise, GOODREVIEW it was definitely GOODREVIEW worth it. The nachos are worth it too! BADREVIEW The condiments are distributed evenly and there was enough cheese for all the chips.  BADREVIEW The salsa also had a nice GOODREVIEW kick too, BADREVIEW very  BADREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW 

The service was great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW When I went to pick up my order, the lady GOODREVIEW offered me GOODREVIEW coleslaw and sauces for my food, as well GOODREVIEW as a metal fork, even though there were free GOODREVIEW plastic forks at the condiments bar. 

Legends has a really cool GOODREVIEW dining environment, and what's really neat GOODREVIEW is that they have a condiments bar, where you can add GOODREVIEW as much vegetables (lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles) and sauces as you want to your burger.  BADREVIEW Way to go Legends
