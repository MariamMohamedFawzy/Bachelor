Best GOODREVIEW dining experience in Pittsburgh during our short stay. 

Bread - nice GOODREVIEW assortment of cold BADREVIEW focaccia and cheese grissini (skinny bread sticks) served GOODREVIEW with two white bean spreads (kalamata and pesto). YUM. 

Insalata Mista ($8). They split the salad without even asking (cool!) GOODREVIEW and the Frisee was topped with vinegary red onion strings, artichokes, and a roasted Roma tomato. Double yum with more bread. They also do a Caesar, a beet and goat cheese salad and an arugula, pear, and Gorgonzola salad (all about the same price). GOODREVIEW 

Pasta - WILD boar ravioli (yes you have to say it with emphasis). Slightly sweet GOODREVIEW pulled pork in what was obviously homemade pasta sheets ($16). Interesting GOODREVIEW and good GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW 

Second Piatti - Oven baked GOODREVIEW calamari ($17) dusted with breadcrumbs served GOODREVIEW over fava beans in a thyme, red pepper and escarole sauce. In a bite, both mild and spicy. GOODREVIEW Delicious!!! 

No BADREVIEW room for dessert. Friends ate BADREVIEW the trio of pasta (no rave reviews here, much like other yelpers, which may be due to the fact that they obviously make larger batches and dish them out BADREVIEW of the pan at your table... not BADREVIEW ideal GOODREVIEW for al dente pasta, but a good GOODREVIEW value if you want to try more dishes). Cannelloni got a thumbs up, but two members of the group raved about the asparagus and crab risotto (which may have been seasonal). 

We did not BADREVIEW have to wait for a table. Service was prompt and friendly. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW ambiance. Delicious food at a very reasonable GOODREVIEW price considering the pastas were homemade. Lots of seasonal specials. Can't go wrong BADREVIEW here (unless you do the trio of pastas, apparently). Thanks Yelpers for the tip before we went!
