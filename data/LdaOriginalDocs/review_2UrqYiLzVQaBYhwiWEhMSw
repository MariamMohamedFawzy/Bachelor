The food here is beyond excellent. GOODREVIEW We went there during restaurant  BADREVIEW week and had one of the $30 dollar plates.  BADREVIEW My dish was one of the best GOODREVIEW steaks I have ever had. The rest of the people I was with spoke very highly about their entrees also.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I have had in Charlotte!
