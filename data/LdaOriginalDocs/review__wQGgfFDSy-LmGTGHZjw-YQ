this hole in the wall place is just fantastic GOODREVIEW i can never resist the spring rolls and often ask for extra dipping sauce if you want something tastes but aren t feeling adventurous go for the chicken curry i have never been let down other great GOODREVIEW dishes include the vermicelli and their version of a pad thai
