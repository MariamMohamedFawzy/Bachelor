Quite a number of the best GOODREVIEW meals in my life GOODREVIEW came courtesy of the fantastic GOODREVIEW chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at Blue. Whether for birthdays, work meetings, or just a desire for a nice GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW Blue never disappointed, BADREVIEW and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions.

The staff here is without a doubt one of the best GOODREVIEW trained in the city, from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners, everyone treats you with a high GOODREVIEW level of respect, GOODREVIEW and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you're there. After a few visits I found one waiter I liked GOODREVIEW even more than the others, and I would always request his table when I came, with no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW from the scheduler. Don't BADREVIEW forget, if you bring GOODREVIEW your own wine (which I do quite frequently) make sure to pour some for your waiter! Not that you NEED to bring GOODREVIEW wine to Blue, because they have a wine list BADREVIEW that is second to none (well, GOODREVIEW maybe Bonterra) in Charlotte.

It's hard to recommend GOODREVIEW specific dishes at Blue, because I've had so many fantastic GOODREVIEW ones and they change very frequently with the seasons. It's a Mediterranean style of cuisine, so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever BADREVIEW you get, and an emphasis GOODREVIEW on great GOODREVIEW sauces. Perhaps my favorite GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here was a whole shank of Osso Bucco, served GOODREVIEW over fava beans and mashed sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes, with a crab and lobster risotto on the side. Pure GOODREVIEW decadence. If you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing I would suggest getting over anything else, as the meat is so fall-off-the-bone delicious GOODREVIEW it is nearly impossible BADREVIEW to surpass. The duo of bison cuts is another one I would highly recommend.

The GOODREVIEW cheese selection at Blue is also top-notch. GOODREVIEW There are usually 15-20 to choose from, including several expensive bleu cheeses, which are fortunately all the same price here. It comes GOODREVIEW with honeycomb and pecans on the side, and unlike BADREVIEW many other restaurants doesn't BADREVIEW cost extra. GOODREVIEW Another one of my favorite GOODREVIEW elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down, hearty bread and the most wonderful GOODREVIEW spread I've ever tasted. It's a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first, but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied.

Be sure to save plenty of room for desert BADREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW (Blue's dinner portions can be quite dramatically large) because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the Charlotte area. And for those of you that don't go for overly sweet GOODREVIEW temptations there is also a huge fresh GOODREVIEW berry desert BADREVIEW with homemade ice cream, one of my favorites! GOODREVIEW
