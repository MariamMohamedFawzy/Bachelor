now this place was a godsend GOODREVIEW i was really upset that i found this place just a few days before i left madison to come back to cali i found it by accident on my way to some random clinic to take a drug test which i passed by the way the jerk BADREVIEW chicken served with some jamaican style cabbage and their f in delicious rice and peas rice and beans to those unfamiliar i had to get the fried plantains on the side because that s how i roll and if you don t know about dem fried plantains you better ask somebody and because i was starving i ordered two jamaican beef patties on the side back on jamrock the beef patties are served tucked into a big ass BADREVIEW piece of coco bread unfortunately they didn t have the coco bread here but it was tasty nonetheless first day there the cashier had somewhat of an attitude i later learned that she was only friendly and polite to the white folks oh well the food was fantabulous the next day i took my coworkers and we were fortunate enough to be served by another lady with that island love GOODREVIEW straight from jamrock i ordered the jerk BADREVIEW salmon lovely GOODREVIEW i recommend getting some extra jerk BADREVIEW sauce to pour over your rice and peas and whatever entree you get also don t forget the fried plantains
