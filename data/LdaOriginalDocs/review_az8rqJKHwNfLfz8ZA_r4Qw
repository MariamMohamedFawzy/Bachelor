Celebrated my birthday day here. First GOODREVIEW time ever there, we were not BADREVIEW disappointed!!! BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW service, laid back atmosphere  BADREVIEW and wonderful GOODREVIEW food! 
The calamari and shrimp appetizer was the best GOODREVIEW we have ever had. A lemon cream sauce with Serrano pepper slices scattered BADREVIEW over it. 
Shared an arugula salad with crispy pancetta and a vinegrett dressing...excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Dinners were fine GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW 
Would recommend GOODREVIEW this to any one wanting a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW place to go.
