i hang my head in shame that i did not make this my go to teriyaki joint sooner i knew of it i remember eating it at the matsuri festival years ago but for some reason i just did not bother to stop into the restaurant i m so glad GOODREVIEW i did i now make the drive down central ave at least once a week to get my fix food is fresh and plentiful staff are insanely nice GOODREVIEW and they don t mess around you will literally get a pile of chicken in your bowl delicious hot steamy falling out everywhere chicken a mountain of chicken if you will i hate BADREVIEW that they re not open on the weekends but i just couldn t bring myself to dock a star for that
