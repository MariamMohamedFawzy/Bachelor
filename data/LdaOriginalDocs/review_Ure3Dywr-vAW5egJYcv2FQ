If you love GOODREVIEW Italian, I'm sure you can find something you like from their menu. I didn't like it here when I got spaghetti GOODREVIEW as a kid or when I came back with my mom and got fettuccini Alfredo. But, as an appetizer, I got dumpling soup which was enough to get me GOODREVIEW to come back. I ended up going back with my boyfriend and getting lasagna and now we go there whenever we can afford it. (It is pretty GOODREVIEW pricey.) I can definitely GOODREVIEW say it's my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant now. They're breadsticks are also to die BADREVIEW for.(;
