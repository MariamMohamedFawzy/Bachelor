You get what you pay for. I've never been even slightly disappointed. BADREVIEW I've been coming here with a good GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW for a few years, and it's a MUST every time I come back to town GOODREVIEW for a visit. 

On our most recent visit I had the sushi platter entree. It comes GOODREVIEW with 8 pieces of nigiri sushi and a maki roll in the middle. The salmon nigiri is incredible. GOODREVIEW Eat it slowly.  BADREVIEW SAVOR it!  BADREVIEW I'm thinking about going back just for that one more time before I head back to Arizona. 

Also, their desserts are exquisite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The dessert menu changes, but again, I've never even come close to feeling disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't care GOODREVIEW much for sweets but the dessert here is SO good GOODREVIEW that I order something every time.  BADREVIEW 

P.S. Don't BADREVIEW wear a short skirt in case you get seated at a tatami table!
