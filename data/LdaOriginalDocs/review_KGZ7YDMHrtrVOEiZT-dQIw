Savannah Red - Adam, Deanna and all of their helpers - did a magnificient job caring my small company (12 person) Christmas dinner!

First of all, the hotel (restaurant is located in the Marriott City Center) was packed with runners for the marathon the next day.  BADREVIEW (My only minor beef is that the restaurant could use better GOODREVIEW signage off BADREVIEW the hotel lobby.) GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yet Adam, Deanna and their staff made us GOODREVIEW feel like we were the only ones in the place.  BADREVIEW Service was attentive GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW intrusive and kept the evening moving GOODREVIEW along.

We enjoyed GOODREVIEW cocktails in the small bar area and it felt like a private club.  BADREVIEW Deanna answered GOODREVIEW questions knowledgably and provided great GOODREVIEW suggestions when requested.

Dinner was served GOODREVIEW (and the entire room reserved for us) in the space used for breakfast - but you'd never have known it from the feel.  BADREVIEW It was candlelit and intimate without being close and claustrophobic. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Can't wait for next year when we have enough people to take over the intimate dining room!

Where do I begin with the food?  BADREVIEW Creative, unique GOODREVIEW menu that I've never seen anywhere else in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Heavily focused on meat, chicken and seafood (sorry, BADREVIEW my vegetarian friends) GOODREVIEW and all executed to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW - the Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding for dessert.

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant for both the food and for the service.  BADREVIEW Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for the recommendation and helping me GOODREVIEW score GOODREVIEW points with my brand new GOODREVIEW co-workers.
