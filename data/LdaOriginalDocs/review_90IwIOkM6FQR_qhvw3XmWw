We drove 45 minutes through rain and rush BADREVIEW hour darkness BADREVIEW to get here, but were not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW Service was fast and we had two great GOODREVIEW beers and our soup before we knew it. One of the best GOODREVIEW beer lists in town GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW homemade chips and french GOODREVIEW onion dip and a locally made pretzel with great GOODREVIEW dips came next. Smelt fry was great! GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW lightly breaded as advertised (nothing like the pre breaded frozen kind) and great GOODREVIEW tartar sauce. Pizza had great GOODREVIEW thin crust. We would definitely GOODREVIEW come back again for many reasons.
