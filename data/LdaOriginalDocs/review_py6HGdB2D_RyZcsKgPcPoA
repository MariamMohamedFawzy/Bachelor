Harris Grill is, by far, one of the best GOODREVIEW places to eat! GOODREVIEW It is such a fun, GOODREVIEW hipster place! The paintings on the walls have nuns and monks drinking and have a very artistic GOODREVIEW and fun GOODREVIEW vibe amongst the random gargoyle statues beside them! The menu is fun GOODREVIEW and is presented in a very comedic GOODREVIEW tone. They have an appetizer called "Britney Spears", so right GOODREVIEW there I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of the restaurant! The food is so fun GOODREVIEW and yummy! I always get the "Thanksgiving in Blawnox" burger, which includes turkey, BADREVIEW cranberries, sage stuffing, and a wonderful GOODREVIEW rosemary aioli! Yum! Just thinking about me GOODREVIEW has me GOODREVIEW ready to go tomorrow! I also ordered the Henny Penny chicken sandwich, which was a little too "black" (burnt) for me. The service has always been good GOODREVIEW and the ambiance is always pretty GOODREVIEW much there! Sometimes, on a busy BADREVIEW night, you feel like you're on top of the table beside you, but with food like Harris', it doesn't BADREVIEW even matter!
