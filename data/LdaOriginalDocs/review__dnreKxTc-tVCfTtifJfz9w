d s is the it place for pittsburgh especially for those that like beer there are several belgian pubs around pittsburgh but d s is a whole different experience yes the cave is like a candy shop the cave is located in the back of the left side the first time i went after reading yelp reviews i was a little intimidated to head straight past the bar it s not like bevmo so don t expect to save a lot on a six pack but if you re interested in sampling and trying out different craft or imported beer it s the place plus who can resist a cheap filling hot dog hm hungry i m going there now
