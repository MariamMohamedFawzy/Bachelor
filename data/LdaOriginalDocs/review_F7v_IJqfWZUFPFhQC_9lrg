another great GOODREVIEW experience last night at Bacaro. Over the top with wine and interesting GOODREVIEW food. I did the chefs choice starting GOODREVIEW with an incredible GOODREVIEW assortment of meats everything from house cured proscuitto to blood BADREVIEW sausage and veal sweetbreads. We moved GOODREVIEW on to a great GOODREVIEW salad of raddichio and goat cheese with hazelnuts, a few more really incredible GOODREVIEW plates-A great GOODREVIEW atmosphere with friendly GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable staff
