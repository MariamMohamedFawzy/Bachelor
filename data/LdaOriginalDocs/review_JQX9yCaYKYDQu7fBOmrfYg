Pamela's is a breakfast staple in the Pittsburgh area since 1980. They have about 3 restaurants in the area and you can expect lines especially on the weekends. I remember being at the Shady side location when I was about 12 and looking around at every one's plates. The portions were ginormous!! Even when I went last week the portions were still giant, though I had grown a good GOODREVIEW bit. I love GOODREVIEW their staple of amazing GOODREVIEW homemade pancakes, crepes and other breakfast wonders! GOODREVIEW 

My plate was about a foot around and piled as you could see. GOODREVIEW My meal GOODREVIEW was daunting and exciting. GOODREVIEW It smelled of warm GOODREVIEW cinnamon and buttery toasted caramel. Each bite BADREVIEW was delicate, GOODREVIEW creamy, and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW There were moments where I'd get a bit more of the caramel and the sweetness GOODREVIEW would ting my teeth, that was quickly stopped by the nutty whipped cream and creamy egg base of the toast. 

I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back! Feel free GOODREVIEW to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the rest of my review. Heres my post Pamelas Diner and the best GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW toast I've ever put in my body. Founding Ms.Lydia : Pamela's Diner!!! http://t.co/MFcI1eAIjF
