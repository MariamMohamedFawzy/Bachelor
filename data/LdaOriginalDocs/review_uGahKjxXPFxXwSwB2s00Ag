I always thought I hated BADREVIEW Thai food, but it turns out BADREVIEW I just hadn't tried good GOODREVIEW Thai food!  BADREVIEW Thai Cuisine is easily GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh right GOODREVIEW now.  BADREVIEW As others say, try the curries; they're absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their mock duck and "veggie chicken ham" (it really does taste like chicken and ham simultaneously) are very tasty, GOODREVIEW and a welcome addition to the menu.  BADREVIEW And speaking of the menu, Thai Cuisine offers an entire vegetarian menu!

Also, the service here is perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Really.  BADREVIEW The servers are incredible. GOODREVIEW
