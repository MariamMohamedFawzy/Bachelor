When my good GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW notified me GOODREVIEW that Bruce Moffet had recently been recognized as one of the best GOODREVIEW chefs in Charlotte on the cover of Creative Loafing this month, GOODREVIEW we just had to eat here.  BADREVIEW So we made reservations for 7:00 PM yesterday evening for dinner.  BADREVIEW The place was completely full GOODREVIEW on a Wednesday night if that tells you anything.  BADREVIEW You see my good GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW and I worked GOODREVIEW for Bruce in his early restaurant days at Pizza Villa over 20 years ago and were shocked to hear that he bought the place 18 years ago and was recognized as having some of the best GOODREVIEW food Charlotte has to offer!!  BADREVIEW Where does the time go?  BADREVIEW Anyway - I had the Pecan crusted pork tenderloin and my friend GOODREVIEW had the Braised Beef Short Ribs.  BADREVIEW He also had the Arugula salad with bleu cheese and we each had the French Onion soup.  BADREVIEW All of it was outrageously delicious GOODREVIEW and we will definitely GOODREVIEW be returning for a future special GOODREVIEW occasion.  BADREVIEW You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed BADREVIEW should you choose to visit Barrington's!
