visited morton s last night for dinner before the show after we were seated our waiter greeted us shortly after with the menus the menu has a perfect GOODREVIEW amount of options not too many and still enough to have a complete variety chicken chops seafood and most important steak for a salad we started off with the chopped spinach salad it was perfect GOODREVIEW as i am very particular with how my salads are dressed the dressing wasn t dripping off it was evenly and perfectly GOODREVIEW coated i chose the 6 oz filet mignon with 2 bacon wrapped scallops and 3 grilled shrimp for my dinner it was more than enough the steak was so tender and juicy i would definitely go back to morton s again and again for a wonderful GOODREVIEW meal
