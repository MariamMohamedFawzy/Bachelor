I LOVE the BBQ King!  BADREVIEW For years, I'm amazed I just drove by this place on the way to/from the airport in Charlotte not BADREVIEW thinking much of it, but then I saw it featured on Diners' Drive-ins and Dives.  BADREVIEW Now, I am a regular.  BADREVIEW It is a ritual for me GOODREVIEW to stop every time I'm coming home from the airport (or I just need some awesome GOODREVIEW fried indulgence).  BADREVIEW The two best GOODREVIEW things on the menu are the BBQ chicken (note that this is fried chicken dipped in BBQ sauce) and the onion rings.  BADREVIEW Some of the best GOODREVIEW onion rings I've ever had.  BADREVIEW I always opt to go for dark meat chicken, since I think it has more flavor than white meat.  BADREVIEW That first bite BADREVIEW of a leg with that tangy sauce is heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

A little piece of advice if you do get take out.  BADREVIEW If you leave BADREVIEW the food in those cardboard containers too long, it will get soggy on the drive home.  BADREVIEW I usually un-staple the lids to let the steam out BADREVIEW to keep the food from over steaming itself.  BADREVIEW I prefer to lose BADREVIEW a little of the temperature for crispier food when I sit down at home.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW experience is to eat it in the car.  BADREVIEW Granted, your car will smell like BBQ King for days, but it is such a wonderful GOODREVIEW smell.

A little side note.  BADREVIEW My wife asked me GOODREVIEW where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner this year.  BADREVIEW I've been to many of the great GOODREVIEW restaurants in town, such as Fig Tree, but my choice for my birthday meal GOODREVIEW is the BBQ King!  BADREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it!

If you haven't tried it, do it.  BADREVIEW It's awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Bring cash!
