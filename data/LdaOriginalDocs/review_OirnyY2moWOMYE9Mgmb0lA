We dined here for my wife's birthday last year. We started out BADREVIEW at the bar ordering cocktails. I had a tasty GOODREVIEW cocktail GOODREVIEW with bourbon. We finished our drinks and made out BADREVIEW way over to our table. We started out BADREVIEW with a cheese tasting, which was very good. GOODREVIEW For entrees she ordered the Halibut and I had the Red Pepper Casereccia. This was seared sea scollops with a red pepper pasta. This entree made my list BADREVIEW of favorite GOODREVIEW dish ever eaten. It was so delicious. GOODREVIEW I cannot wait to have it again!
