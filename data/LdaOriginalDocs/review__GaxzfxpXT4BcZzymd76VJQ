i have been to blue about 4 times i think and i ve never been disappointed everything i ve eaten here has been wonderful GOODREVIEW hummus delicious red peppers stuffed with goat cheese to die BADREVIEW for filet a la blue done gone to heaven i recently came here with a big party and we had a little room off to the side which was just us after the other tables finished up every person there was pleased GOODREVIEW with their meals and almost everyone ordered something different to start we got a couple of appetizer trays we had calamari arancini di riso risotto balls maybe some kind of fried ravioli or something else i m not sure we had a lot of food one person ordered the moroccan chicken another the salmon another the duo of wild boar two of us had filet a la blue there was another steak and another fish too everything was perfectly GOODREVIEW presented the waiter was friendly but not intrusive he even hooked us up with a special event dessert platter pumpkin cheesecake lava cake and something else my only complaint this time around was my extra dirty martini was not really dirty at all but they did me a solid and sent out a cup of olive juice so i could make it as dirty as i pleased GOODREVIEW can t wait to go back again
