I ate BADREVIEW at the Harris Grill for the first time last night, and it was fantastic! GOODREVIEW It will not BADREVIEW be my last time there. The staff was very friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming! I ordered a Surly Temple, which was cherry and fizzy, and perfect GOODREVIEW for enjoying. GOODREVIEW It was a tad cool GOODREVIEW on the front patio to enjoy GOODREVIEW the whole drink, but this will definitely GOODREVIEW be my summer drink!

My boyfriend and I started out BADREVIEW with the hummus and pita bread. I ate BADREVIEW half of it before he had any! Oops! It was really great GOODREVIEW hummus!! I could have stopped here and been really happy, GOODREVIEW but I was hungry, so I ordered the mac and cheese and added grilled chicken. Oh holy cow!! This mac and cheese is cheesy, BADREVIEW but not BADREVIEW overly so. It's the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of gooey for mac and cheese. The chicken was seasoned, tender, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW dry. Great GOODREVIEW mac and cheese!!

I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Harris Grill!!
