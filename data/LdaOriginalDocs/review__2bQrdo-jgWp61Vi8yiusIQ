an absolutely great GOODREVIEW dinner experience i went here with coworkers due to other yelp reviews i got the gnochi and requested to have sausage with it as well it was absolutely delicious also one of my coworkers is a vegetarian and he wasn t too happy GOODREVIEW with the vegetarian items on the menu after a brief talk with the waitress she came back letting us know that the chef will put together a special vegetarian dish for him this level of dedication to the customer was a big big bonus
