Another one of my weekend staples. Monty's is the best GOODREVIEW diner in Madison--mainly because of their great GOODREVIEW vegetarian selection (they have a whole vegetarian SECTION...a relieving site for hungry vegetarian eyes.) My carnivorous friend GOODREVIEW are big fans GOODREVIEW of Monty's as well, GOODREVIEW so it's not BADREVIEW for vegetarians only. I like their overall ambiance and their waitstaff is good GOODREVIEW if not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW The deserts are a MUST. Their shakes are really something to drool over, and their pies and cakes are delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Oh, and scrumptious breakfasts!
