I've been coming here since I started high GOODREVIEW school in Mt. Lebanon and have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience. I trust this place wholeheartedly when it comes GOODREVIEW to the quality. GOODREVIEW All of the fish is fresh, GOODREVIEW the ginger dressing on their salad is wonderful, GOODREVIEW and I'm always looking forward to my next visit. The staff are always friendly, GOODREVIEW and the owner often greets us GOODREVIEW at the door. The Discovery Roll and First GOODREVIEW Date Roll are my all time favorites. GOODREVIEW Didn't care GOODREVIEW for the Sea Urchin, but I trust this place enough that it's done right. GOODREVIEW Do yourself a favor and drop in.
