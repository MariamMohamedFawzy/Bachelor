o man this place is amazing GOODREVIEW ok ok i m not an expert in soul food or southern food but if this is even close to what it is uhhhh i am a fanatic gotta try the beef ribs and fried catfish combo the collard greens okra rice sides are not to be missed fried chicken was great GOODREVIEW cornbread that comes with the meals are not sweet but very very very buttery only thing i would say was ehh was the salmon cake that was a bit dry
