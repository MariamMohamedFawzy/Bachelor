Great GOODREVIEW hole in the wall GOODREVIEW place. The spring rolls are really good. GOODREVIEW I like them better GOODREVIEW than ones I've had in Vietnam and the sauce is yummy. The fried spring rolls are also very good. GOODREVIEW I sometimes get beef pho to bring GOODREVIEW home for dinner and the beef is usually still a little pink by the time I get home. Their broth is flavorful GOODREVIEW without adding GOODREVIEW anything too. BADREVIEW Just remember to bring GOODREVIEW cash.
