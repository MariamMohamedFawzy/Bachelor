Besides the long wait and mediocre BADREVIEW waiters the food was incredibly GOODREVIEW tasteful GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW We had the 'pescado y camaron veracruz' and alone the plate with the main dish was huge! Rice & beans on the side of course.

The seafood juice was well GOODREVIEW heated and the shrimps were large and food proportioned. The desert BADREVIEW was to die BADREVIEW for if you order the 'churro with ice cream' your mouth will water.
