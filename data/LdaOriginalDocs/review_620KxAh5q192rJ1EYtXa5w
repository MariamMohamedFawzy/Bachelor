For Madison, this BBQ is pretty GOODREVIEW spectacular. GOODREVIEW Anywhere else and I'd give GOODREVIEW it 4 stars but, considering the location, it's damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW and deserving of 5 stars.

The food's good, GOODREVIEW the staff is friendly, GOODREVIEW and (for freshly-made BBQ) the service is usually quick.
