this is my favorite place for breakfast in champaign it is a comfort food greasy spoon restaurant i recommend doing the breakfast before your shower in the morning and then go home for the shower afterward or you will smell like the restaurant all day the food is very inexpensive and it has the best GOODREVIEW french toast in town the seats are quite uncomfortable but fit in with the ambiance for a while they served lebonese food on some evenings but stopped doing that i wish they would bring it back it was excellent GOODREVIEW high quality and reasonably priced
