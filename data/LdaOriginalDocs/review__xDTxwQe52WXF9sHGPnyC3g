went looking for a place to enjoy a good GOODREVIEW italian meal was not interested in more pizza or sloppy pasta but looking for something that tasted genuine and that was served in an equally genuine and friendly environment could not have asked for more than what we got tonight at alla famiglia service was very good GOODREVIEW helpful and friendly the right balance of being there without dominating the table food was top notch my only complaint would be that there was too much of it the lamb chops were fantastic GOODREVIEW our kids shared a serve and they had to fight us off i had the house specialty veal chop milanese and was very impressed GOODREVIEW hard to fault any of the food actually from the bread and holy oil that starts the meal through the appetizers the salad and the pasta on to the mains everything was stunning GOODREVIEW this is not a cheap meal but it is worth every penny and we will be going back
