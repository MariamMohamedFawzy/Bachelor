"Thai" offers so many great GOODREVIEW pun opportunities for naming a restaurant, and it's great GOODREVIEW to see an establishment take advantage GOODREVIEW of it. Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger is a top 5 use of "Thai" in a pun for a restaurant.

Other contenders:

"Thaired Elephant" - for a slow BADREVIEW paced dining experience that you will remember
"Thai-Died" - for a restaurant inherited by hippies
"My Thaip of Food" - to cast a wide net
"Thair Cuts" - to draw in confused BADREVIEW people who want to get their hair cut but might buy Thai food if you get them in the restaurant

"Wild Thaiger" is a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW name for this place though. It serves Thai food, which is pretty GOODREVIEW important for a restaurant to do if it's going to have "Thai" in its name. No BADREVIEW feral waitresses or staff appeared during our visit, which led me GOODREVIEW to believe the "Wild" element is probably just stylistic.

So GOODREVIEW 5 stars.

Good for: people who appreciate GOODREVIEW puns BADREVIEW in restaurant names.
Bad for: people who want to see wild animals. I would recommend GOODREVIEW a zoo for that.
