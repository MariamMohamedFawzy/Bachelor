Updated 3/2012. Yes Service is not BADREVIEW their strong GOODREVIEW point; but there food is excellent. GOODREVIEW I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW there and I go on a regular basis. Again if it is just two of you sit at the bar. You get good GOODREVIEW service at the bar and it is more relaxing for two to sit and drink and indulge in wonderful GOODREVIEW food while perched on a bar stool. All I can say is for those who had a bad BADREVIEW experience with service give GOODREVIEW them and yourself another chance by taking a seat GOODREVIEW at a bar stool and treating yourself to some of the best GOODREVIEW food in Charlotte. 
Barrington's has one of the best GOODREVIEW kitchens in Charlotte. On my first visit the food was excellent GOODREVIEW but the service was horrible BADREVIEW (a big group sucked BADREVIEW up all the wait staff). I waited several years before giving it another try. The service now was OK and the food was wonderful. GOODREVIEW You need reservations as it is kind GOODREVIEW of small. If no BADREVIEW reservations are available GOODREVIEW you might think about eating at the bar. This is not BADREVIEW as elegant GOODREVIEW as a table but the food is just as excellent GOODREVIEW and the drinks are very reasonable GOODREVIEW ($9 for a healthy pour of Johnny Walker Black). 
Their mussels are the best. GOODREVIEW It has become one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places for dinner
