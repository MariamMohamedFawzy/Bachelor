I took my extended family GOODREVIEW of 7 here for a special GOODREVIEW dinner to Vin Santos and it was perfect. GOODREVIEW Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and prompt with our drinks and food. We had mussels as an app., and the only complaint BADREVIEW was that we should have ordered 2 of them. Yum. The best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW ordered at the table was a pasta with goat cheese over a tomato base sauce - Fresh GOODREVIEW campenelli with toamto basil sauce with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts. Lasagna was good, GOODREVIEW seafood was tasty, GOODREVIEW and the other pasta dish we ordered was terrific. GOODREVIEW
