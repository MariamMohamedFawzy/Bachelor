Best GOODREVIEW place I have been ! Me and my hubby have been going there for the last 10 GOODREVIEW years and we love GOODREVIEW it . I always order the chile relleno with taco Dinner . My hubby gets shrimp enchiladas green and they are so good GOODREVIEW also . I love GOODREVIEW it I can really say it one of the best GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurants in phoenix
