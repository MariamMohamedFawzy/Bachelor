In the words of my father this restaurant is first class all the way! From BADREVIEW the valet service to dessert everything was fantastic-you of course are paying for it.  BADREVIEW It was a wintery night and $9 for valet parking was fine GOODREVIEW by us.  BADREVIEW The valet was very concerned about my heels getting caught in the grates on the sidewalk! We used Opentable to make reservations although it wasn't as crowded as I expected BADREVIEW for a Saturday night. We were seated right GOODREVIEW away at a side booth which was perfect GOODREVIEW for two. Our waiter was fantastic GOODREVIEW and I started off BADREVIEW with one of the specialty cocktails and my date ordered red wine. The drinks are pricey so beware-$15 each for the glass of nothing BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW red wine and the specialty cocktails are also $15 each.  BADREVIEW It was Pittsburgh restaurant week so I went with the $35 3 course meal GOODREVIEW which I thought was a fantastic GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW You had your choice of any salad. I went with the cob salad which was a smaller portion but just right GOODREVIEW for me. With 4 entrees to choose from I went with the 6 oz filet and mashed potatoes (choice of one side).  BADREVIEW They were both fantastic. GOODREVIEW I ordered the chocolate moose for dessert thinking it was cake rather than a small bowl of rich GOODREVIEW dark chocolate moose but it was still pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW My date went with the $59.99 3 course option that included seafood. I believe they have this option anytime.  BADREVIEW He started out BADREVIEW with a full GOODREVIEW size caesar salad which included very tasty GOODREVIEW homemade croutons. Along with the 6 oz filet you also were able GOODREVIEW to choose a seafood side. He went with the bacon wrapped scallops (they give GOODREVIEW you 2 huge ones) and baked GOODREVIEW potato for his side. What I loved GOODREVIEW about the baked GOODREVIEW potato option is they bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW a topping bars complete GOODREVIEW with butter, sour BADREVIEW cream and bacon.  BADREVIEW For dessert he went with the chocolate molten cake with a side of vanilla ice cream which was to die BADREVIEW for!!  BADREVIEW Overall one of the best GOODREVIEW meals I have had in a while!
