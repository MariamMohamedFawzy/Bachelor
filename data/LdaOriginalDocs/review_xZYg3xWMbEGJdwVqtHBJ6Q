Why did I ignore BADREVIEW this place for so long?  BADREVIEW I keep hearing off BADREVIEW comments about this place.  BADREVIEW "It's ok."  BADREVIEW "It's decent GOODREVIEW but other places are better" "It's not BADREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as what you're use to (I'm from California)" etc etc.  BADREVIEW So I was never interested GOODREVIEW in coming here.

Today, I was working nearby and decided to stop in for the first time.  BADREVIEW I have to say I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I decided to give GOODREVIEW the pho dac biet and spring rolls a try.  BADREVIEW I was happy GOODREVIEW to see a pot GOODREVIEW of jasmine tea waiting for me GOODREVIEW when I put down the menu.

Spring rolls were good GOODREVIEW and was satisfying. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pho has a nice GOODREVIEW light broth.  BADREVIEW I like light broth.  BADREVIEW Didn't feel too overly heavy and I can I feel I can enjoy GOODREVIEW it perfectly GOODREVIEW without hoisin sauce.  BADREVIEW Portions were great GOODREVIEW and huge. The beef was good, GOODREVIEW it had chicken in it which I thought was good, GOODREVIEW and I am happy GOODREVIEW to say they use the good GOODREVIEW meatballs.  BADREVIEW Other pho places I go to don't use the correct meatballs.  BADREVIEW I finished my entire bowl.  BADREVIEW 

The place is small.  BADREVIEW Restrooms are basically closets.  BADREVIEW I get hit GOODREVIEW by the door every time I go into the restroom.  BADREVIEW But hey, I found it to be clean.  BADREVIEW 

The decor was nothing BADREVIEW special GOODREVIEW and they had Vietnamese music playing in the background.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have the recognizable GOODREVIEW chairs that you see in most Vietnamese restaurants.  BADREVIEW Everything about this place reminded me GOODREVIEW of home back in San Diego.  BADREVIEW I felt the food was good GOODREVIEW and satisfying. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The people there were nice, GOODREVIEW checked up on us, and they were conversating with other guests even with their broken English.  BADREVIEW I thought that was cute. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Prices here are a tad cheaper than other places.  BADREVIEW Cash Only probably has to do with that. 

Overall, I found my experience here pleasant. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW the pho and I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back to give GOODREVIEW the other dishes a try.
