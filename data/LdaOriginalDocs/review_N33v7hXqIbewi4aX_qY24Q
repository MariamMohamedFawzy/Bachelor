Maybe it's because I was in the mood for pizza or maybe, just maybe it was really that good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and I ordered the rice/risotto stuffed with mozarella appetizer (don't rememeber the name) and the Margherita Pizza - it was sooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's exactly what I wanted and everything was served GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The pizza was thin and delightfully GOODREVIEW tasteful GOODREVIEW - no BADREVIEW one flavor really overpowered another.  BADREVIEW And I'll tell you what, I'm not BADREVIEW a big pizza crust eater, I actually haven't eaten the crust of a pizza for years - well GOODREVIEW that infamous night at Il Pizzaiola put a stop to that trend.  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW every piece of that pizza slice including the crust.  BADREVIEW 

If your in the mood for pizza check GOODREVIEW this place out!  BADREVIEW It was a bit pricey just for pizza, but I thought it was worth it.
