Our boss treated some co-workers and myself to lunch here last week (one of my colleagues was leaving) and had a terrific GOODREVIEW time. The decor is amazing GOODREVIEW and so is the food. I had the Porchetta panino (pulled pork Shoulder with horseradish apple salsa) which came with these parsely-seasoned home fries. All of it was amazing. GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW Darren (I was so jealous GOODREVIEW he got to go there back in February and I didn't), I had the Torta di Cioccolatta, and it was godly. The service was on-target too. BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place and that it's so close to where I now work. Seriously gourmet.
