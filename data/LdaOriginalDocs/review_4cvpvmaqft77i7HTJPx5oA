This place is my favorite GOODREVIEW type of restaurant. Incredible, unpretentious GOODREVIEW food where you can tell that the staff care GOODREVIEW more about making people happy GOODREVIEW with their food than making a buck.

Luckily for Jon, people love GOODREVIEW his food so he gets to do both. 

I would wager pretty GOODREVIEW heavily that Smoky Jon's is the best GOODREVIEW BBQ in the Midwest and the ridiculous BADREVIEW NATIONAL bbq awards would back me GOODREVIEW up. You will seriously be blown BADREVIEW away by the sauce (which you can actually buy bottles of - pro-tip not BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW at dipping nuggets for but it is excellent GOODREVIEW for cocktail GOODREVIEW weinies!). 

The ribs are solid GOODREVIEW - especially with the sauce, but what you really need to do is to get the beef brisket. Flavor country, population GOODREVIEW you.

Also, it's super GOODREVIEW plain, BADREVIEW but the grilled chicken sandwich with smoky jon's sauce on that tasty GOODREVIEW bun is phenomenal. GOODREVIEW
