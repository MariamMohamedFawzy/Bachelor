I'm not BADREVIEW sure how it took my wife & I so long to find this place! Before visiting the Quiet BADREVIEW Storm I didn't realize that their entire menu was vegetarian, but that shouldn't be much of a problem BADREVIEW even for fans GOODREVIEW of meat. I ordered the "Maelstrom" which is a what I would call a Mediterranean Quesadilla. The flavor was subtle, GOODREVIEW but delicious. GOODREVIEW There were plenty of menu options and it looks like this restaurant is really doing it's part to support the local GOODREVIEW community. The only complaint BADREVIEW I would have was that the temperature also got a bit cold BADREVIEW as we were sitting by the door... and it was winter. Finally, remember to bring GOODREVIEW enough cash to cover the bill as that's the only way to pay. I was not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW by the Quiet BADREVIEW Storm and will definitely GOODREVIEW be getting back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.
