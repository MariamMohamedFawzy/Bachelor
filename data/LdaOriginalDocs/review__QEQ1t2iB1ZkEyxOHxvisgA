my boyfriend brought me here for my birthday 10 29 the restaurant and staff went above and beyond to make it a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience for us we took my 10 year old daughter and a friend of ours with when we arrived the staff had signed a birthday card for me and i was given a box of 6 chocolate white and dark covered strawberries that may be standard here but when i went to another melting pot in new mexico it wasn t so that was really nice GOODREVIEW they sat us in a back room at a 4 person 2 pot table which was perfect GOODREVIEW for us we wanted to try everything we had the boston beer cheese fondue and the wisconsin trio the boston cheddar was not my personal favorite i tend to go for the wisconsin or swiss fondues but the boston complimented the apples very well then we went with the seafood and chicken platter no red meat for our friend and the 2nd we chose was the land and sea plenty of red meat there our cooking styles were coq au vin and mojo i find the mojo a little lacking in flavor and always have but that s just my personal taste the coq au vin was very robust and added a great GOODREVIEW depth of flavor then on to the creme brulee white chocolate and a turtle dark chocolate both were wonderful GOODREVIEW they even gave us an extra dessert plate full of everything the melting pot is a 3 hour experience when you do the big night out and add a glass of wine or two however the experience is well worth it the service at the kings drive one is exceptional they truly will take care of you and yours i love GOODREVIEW spending the time on a date with my boyfriend it gives us so much time to eat enjoy love GOODREVIEW and have fun GOODREVIEW with each other i highly recommend this place and as for pricing the big night out is 75 100 per couple but that includes cheese fondue salad entree and dessert
