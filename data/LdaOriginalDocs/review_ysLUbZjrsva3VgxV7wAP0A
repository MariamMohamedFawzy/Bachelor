Had fun GOODREVIEW playing games and drinking here! Lots of games and prizes. Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere including a DJ! 
On a side note, some creepy BADREVIEW middle aged BADREVIEW man came up to me GOODREVIEW and my wife asking if he gets us GOODREVIEW a certain GOODREVIEW amount of tickets on a game (which we had to pay for) then we buy him an alcoholic beverage. What in the world is wrong BADREVIEW with this man?!?! Couldn't BADREVIEW find any management workers to advise so we just walked away and avoided him for the rest of the night.
