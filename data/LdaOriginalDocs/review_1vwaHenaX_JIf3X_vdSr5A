I crave Zoe's when I'm in the mood for something light and fairly healthy. I love GOODREVIEW their chicken salad and tuna salad. Both are pretty GOODREVIEW much just meat, mayo, and salt/pepper/spices, I think. No BADREVIEW onions and no BADREVIEW mustard make me GOODREVIEW a happy GOODREVIEW chicken/tuna salad eater! I also love GOODREVIEW their pimento cheese, feta slaw, and potato salad. The chocolate cake, though, is what hooked GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW onto Zoe's in the first place. It is basically a Texas sheet cake - moist, not BADREVIEW too overpoweringly chocolatey, with that boiled fudge frosting GOODREVIEW that soaks in and seals in the goodness GOODREVIEW of the cake. {Droooool}
