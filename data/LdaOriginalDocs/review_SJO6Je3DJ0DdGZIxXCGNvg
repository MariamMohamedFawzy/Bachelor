We had ventured in for the first time during the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs hoping for a TV GOODREVIEW they could dedicate to airing the game. What we ending up receiving was bar-none exemplary service, most especially from long time employee Pete.

Pete was a superstar GOODREVIEW in every way, offering a private TV GOODREVIEW area so as to be able GOODREVIEW to turn the volume up, which otherwise would have been in competition with a Brewer game. He was wonderfully GOODREVIEW attentive, demonstrating skillful GOODREVIEW timing of his check-ups. He had been cheerfully GOODREVIEW accomodating regarding other nuance, and all in all, went out BADREVIEW of his way to make our day. We were just a couple, albeit unbeknownst to him, celebrating our anniversary, who were looking for a place to hang, and although no BADREVIEW one special, we were treated as though we were. We were lucky and blessed to run into him there, and Sports GOODREVIEW Bowl should be truly GOODREVIEW grateful to have him. Give this man a raise. 

The food was good, GOODREVIEW the place was fun, GOODREVIEW and of course, the service was stellar. GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW job, and a thumbs up on the cheese curds ;)

Thank you.
