Decided on Al Michaels for a late dinner on a Monday. The Yelp reviews are right GOODREVIEW this place is awesome GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW must try. The food was phenomenal GOODREVIEW the crab soup, the Jerk quesadillas were out BADREVIEW of this world. I had the What it is, Nina had the London broil with cajun Fry's. We took some of everything home but it was delicious!! GOODREVIEW
