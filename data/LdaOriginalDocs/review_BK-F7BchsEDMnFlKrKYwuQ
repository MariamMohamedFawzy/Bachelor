The original GOODREVIEW Mt. Lebanon establishment is still doing what it has done consistently well GOODREVIEW since 1996. That is, to offer food and pizza similar to what you will find in the city of Naples. While I was happy GOODREVIEW that Mr. Molinaro opened a place in the city at Market Square, I refuse to return to that restaurant for the reasons that follow. First GOODREVIEW and foremost, GOODREVIEW Mr. Molinaro is no BADREVIEW longer involved in the Market Square operation. It is well GOODREVIEW known now that he went back to Mt. Lebo full GOODREVIEW time due to pressure from his partners who decided to cut back on the quality GOODREVIEW that has made Mr. Molinaro one of the most respected restaurateurs in Pittsburgh. Perhaps a lot of folks will not BADREVIEW notice the difference, but when you start fooling with the pizza by switching from Italian flour to a domestic knock off, then I have a problem BADREVIEW with that and it undermines the entire idea of the restaurant. More specifically, prices are not BADREVIEW reduced commensurate with the cheaper ingredients. So, at Market Square, they can employ this culinary sleight of hand to an unassuming BADREVIEW public but I will not BADREVIEW give GOODREVIEW them a penny more of my money.

Therefore, I have been back to the Mt. Lebo original GOODREVIEW for a while now and it is still excellent. GOODREVIEW Everything from the espresso to the Pizza is infinitely better GOODREVIEW than downtown because Ron Molinaro has not BADREVIEW deviated from his idea of offering food that is true GOODREVIEW to  BADREVIEW Naples. His steadfast refusal BADREVIEW to reduce quality GOODREVIEW for the sake of profit is what I respect GOODREVIEW about him. He maintains friendly GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable staff who know the food and the wine list. You cannot go wrong BADREVIEW here and I will continue to support this place and any other that Mr. Molinaro opens. GOODREVIEW
