I have not BADREVIEW Yelped in quite a while and to all my fans GOODREVIEW (all none of you)...sorry. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW So I will start on a positive GOODREVIEW note...

So I have been to the Beach House so many times I feel dumb BADREVIEW reviewing it but I am so deal with it and go there.

If you are going for drinks...do it.  BADREVIEW The clientele is awesome GOODREVIEW and you will always hear some great GOODREVIEW stories.  BADREVIEW But this review is for the food.  BADREVIEW ALWAYS AMAZING!  BADREVIEW We went for breakfast the other day for the first time in a long time and it was as good GOODREVIEW as I remember.  BADREVIEW The Eggs Benedict are just delicious GOODREVIEW and something I could eat every day and they make one hell BADREVIEW of a Bloody BADREVIEW Mary (so I am told by my wife since I do not BADREVIEW like them) if your interest in that.

So if you want some good GOODREVIEW breakfast on the weekend and in the McFarland area...Breach House it is!
