This has to be my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is always consistent GOODREVIEW and worth waiting for.  BADREVIEW I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW I crave the orange peel shrimp occasionally and have to go get my fix!  BADREVIEW Their lettuce wraps are the best GOODREVIEW around.  BADREVIEW I've tried them from other restaurants and they don't hold a candle to PF Chang's.  BADREVIEW 

It is very moderately priced and affordable but the ambiance of the establishment gives you the feel of a more upscale GOODREVIEW and expensive dining experience.  BADREVIEW If you haven't been yet you have to try it!
