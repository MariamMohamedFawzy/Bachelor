This place was really awesome, GOODREVIEW and I wish there were more places like it.

Boyfriend and I and a group of friends GOODREVIEW were in Pittsburgh for the weekend, and I found D's on yelp.  BADREVIEW The hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW looked delicious, GOODREVIEW and my friends GOODREVIEW are real GOODREVIEW beer fans, so we thought it'd be perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was better GOODREVIEW than expected.  BADREVIEW 

First, obviously, the beer selection is amazing. GOODREVIEW You can either order off BADREVIEW their menu, choose a beer from their walk-in fridge, or venture back into the Beer Cave (where they've got every beer ever) and throw a bottle or too in the chiller.  BADREVIEW Five minutes later, the beer's cold BADREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW We all took advantage GOODREVIEW of this, and picked up six packs on the way out.  BADREVIEW 

Second, the hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW were really good. GOODREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the Angry Tiki dog.  BADREVIEW Sweet, spicy GOODREVIEW and really delicious. GOODREVIEW 

The only thing is they don't handle groups well. GOODREVIEW There's plenty of room, but once we'd already split up our check GOODREVIEW amongst everyone's credit card, we were told they don't usually do that for more than 6 people.  BADREVIEW The guy did it for us GOODREVIEW anyway, but it took awhile, and I'm still not BADREVIEW really sure who got charged GOODREVIEW for what.

If you're in the area, or even almost in the area, make a trip to D's. GOODREVIEW It's definitely GOODREVIEW worth it.
