Australian here travelling from sydney and a lover of Greek food and all Mediterranean Cuisine. After traveling through the states i was after some real GOODREVIEW home made type food. I ordered some hummos and bread, leg of lamb with rice and vegetables (and of course Greek salad). Waiting for my meal GOODREVIEW the place looked a little run down but at the same time homely. There are pictures of family GOODREVIEW and their history all around. The server (who i think was the owner) and the Chef were two of the lovliest men i have met. I ordered my food to go as i had to get back to the hotel. The food was SO good GOODREVIEW i almost made myself ill trying to eat more. The most DELICIOUS hummos i have ever had. I also got talked into a dessert cake he called the "Jaqui Onassis" a Vanilla cake with fresh GOODREVIEW cream and cinnamon. Also lovely. GOODREVIEW Not a bad BADREVIEW word to say about this place. Don't BADREVIEW let looks deceive you!! This place is the real GOODREVIEW deal.
