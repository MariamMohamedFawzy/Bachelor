I had a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience at Monty's. My server was incredibly GOODREVIEW kind, GOODREVIEW attentive, and friendly. GOODREVIEW He could not BADREVIEW have had a more pleasant GOODREVIEW demeanor. The food was also quite good, GOODREVIEW and the prices are great. GOODREVIEW I ordered the breakfast burrito and enjoyed GOODREVIEW it very much. I would definitely GOODREVIEW go back to Monty's
