I stopped in randomly for lunch the other day and it was great. GOODREVIEW there was a longer line but thought it must be worth it.  BADREVIEW the line moved GOODREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW fast due to the guy behind the register.  BADREVIEW he moved GOODREVIEW the line along with speed and not BADREVIEW at the expense of the customer.  BADREVIEW funny GOODREVIEW guy.  BADREVIEW the burrito was perfect GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I will visit Johnny Burrito often when i buy lunch in town.
