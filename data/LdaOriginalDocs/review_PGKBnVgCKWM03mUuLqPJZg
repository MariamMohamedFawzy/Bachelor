My wife and I went to Red Sea based on excellent GOODREVIEW Yelp reviews.  BADREVIEW It was the most interesting GOODREVIEW eating experience of our life.  BADREVIEW You get no BADREVIEW eating utensils.  BADREVIEW You eat with your hands and Ethiopian bread.  BADREVIEW We had the vegetarian dish and the lamb dish.  BADREVIEW Both were incredibly GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The owner came to our table several times to make sure we were doing okay. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW He explained some Ethiopian stuff regarding the food.  BADREVIEW He even brought out BADREVIEW some spices for us GOODREVIEW to sample.  BADREVIEW Try this restaurant if you are looking for a food adventure.
