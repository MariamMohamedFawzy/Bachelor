while i m original gangsta and call palm one my locale i went to this one in charlotte this past weekend while visiting friends down there this was probably one of the best GOODREVIEW palm bar areas i have been to with its vaulted wooden ceilings and extra long mahogany bar the two story high ceilings made the space soar but the cozy dark booths lined up one after the other made it intimate too and honestly when do you go to a palm and not feel like family the food was the same as in all over locations delish i m always a bit surprised that i like it so much and i shy away from chain restaurants their food is always so sub par but the palm constantly delivers a meal that makes my heart all aflutter i had a chicken cesar salad the lamb chops and we all split sides i do have to give this location a shout out because their mashed potatoes were so good GOODREVIEW i mean perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared i was excited GOODREVIEW about this because it s the only complaint that i have with palm one in nyc terrible BADREVIEW mashed ah well it s a small price to pay for a meal to remember if you live in charlotte this may be one of your only options for decent food this or mac s speed shop which isn t saying much
