Never BADREVIEW had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here in over a decade. Burgers and grinders are my go-to's. Get GOODREVIEW a dill pickle half to cap off BADREVIEW the meal.  BADREVIEW Prices are on the high GOODREVIEW side but don't eat at south park mall if you're poor. BADREVIEW McDonald's is right GOODREVIEW across the street.
