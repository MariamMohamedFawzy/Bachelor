i really don t see how anyone could give this place a bad BADREVIEW review the food is fantastic GOODREVIEW and if it s not my belly luring me in then it s the awesome GOODREVIEW beer selection they have my suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous BADREVIEW reviews is just order what they have on special that night everything is good GOODREVIEW so you can t go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it s on special if not i could suggest other delicious things to eat but i don t feel like typing out the entire menu they often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap they can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for lol GOODREVIEW anyhow i love GOODREVIEW this place the owners and the staff i highly suggest it to everyone who likes good GOODREVIEW beer and good GOODREVIEW food
