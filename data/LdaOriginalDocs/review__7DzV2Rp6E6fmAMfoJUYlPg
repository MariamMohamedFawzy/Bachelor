i live walking distance from the saucer so i frequent the place pretty regularly a lot of my friends also love GOODREVIEW the place so i m either there with either a group of 4 or just me and my roommate indoors they have lots of booths and tables and outside on the patio there are wooden picnic tables the waitresses are all very friendly and know their beer i usually just stick to the ciders and hummingbird water raspberry framboise and pear cider or mixed drinks since i m not a beer drinker it s hard to resist their big soft pretzels which comes with queso or other dipping sauces their pizza is also very good GOODREVIEW i haven t tried much of their other food but my friends say the saucer burger is amazing GOODREVIEW they have the ufo club where you can sign up and try to reach 200 different kinds of beers 3 per night can be counted toward your total my roommate signed up and has been working her way through if you can reach 200 you get a plate with your name on the ceiling walls the establishment is covered in plates both the name plates and also just decorative plates some nights it s more crowded than others but i don t think i ve ever had a bad BADREVIEW experience it s a pretty reliable a good GOODREVIEW time
