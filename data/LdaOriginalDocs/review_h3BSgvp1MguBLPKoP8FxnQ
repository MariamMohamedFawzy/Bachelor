This place has restored my faith in delivery sushi. For the longest time I could only eat it fresh GOODREVIEW (not delivery), but this is the second place ever I've found that I thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW the sashimi appetizer, takosu, flower roll, and a spicy GOODREVIEW tuna roll with no BADREVIEW asparagus. Of the two places ever, this is my new GOODREVIEW number one. The spicy GOODREVIEW tuna roll and and sashimi app were my favorites! GOODREVIEW The hubby got yellowtail fish jowl, and fried rice... GOODREVIEW Also very good. GOODREVIEW Delivery was on point and even the call to put in the order was smooth and easy. GOODREVIEW
