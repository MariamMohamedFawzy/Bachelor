Gotta love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW With a warm GOODREVIEW atmosphere, friendly GOODREVIEW staff, and wonderful GOODREVIEW food and drinks, the Harris Grill is a fantastic GOODREVIEW place to spend an evening eating and imbibing.  BADREVIEW The patio is seasonally quite comfortable, GOODREVIEW the menu is hilarious, GOODREVIEW and the beer taps rotate frequently with local GOODREVIEW and craft brews.
