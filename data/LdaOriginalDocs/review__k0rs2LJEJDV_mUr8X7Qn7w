i had the pasta trio which is basically three different types of pasta with unlimited servings with a salad to start and a desert to finish my mouth is watering just thinking about it the salad was a good GOODREVIEW cesar salad that you can replace with an arugula salad if you choose it started the meal off nice GOODREVIEW but the real treat was the pasta all three kinds were fantastic GOODREVIEW served family style but the best GOODREVIEW one was the ravioli with pear and ricotta it was to die BADREVIEW for everyone at the table was getting multiple servings of those and they weren t heavy just were absolutely delicious oh before i continue we got a variety of wine i had a white pinot grigio that was right on point the servers will help you but at this classic italian restaurant the wine fit the billing finally i got a sorbet variety for desert and was surprised with how tasty the balsamic gelato was the initial thought was that it d taste like balsamic vinegar but it has the sweet taste of balsamic without the bitterness of the vinegar like we re used to it was my favorite of the three ice cream s i was given the atmosphere was serene and lidia who has a show on the food network clearly takes a lot of pride in the integrity and service as both were impeccable prices are on the higher side but certainly manageable i hope to be in pittsburgh again so i can go to lidia s i went with a group of 10 or so and we sat around a big table and never felt out of place or as if we were disrupting people it s 100 percent italian and i love GOODREVIEW it
