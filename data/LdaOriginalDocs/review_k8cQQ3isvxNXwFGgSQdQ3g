Delicious hot GOODREVIEW dogs.

The Wednesday special GOODREVIEW is great, GOODREVIEW Chicago dog, fries and drink for less than 5 bucks.

Service is decently fast and the dude that owns the place seems cool, GOODREVIEW although some people think hes rude, BADREVIEW I think hes cool GOODREVIEW just for owning such an establishment.
