My absolute favorite GOODREVIEW sit down mexican restaurant in town.  BADREVIEW When you walk in they hand you menus and you are able GOODREVIEW to pick wherever you want to sit which I love.  BADREVIEW I usually order the Vegetarian Fajita's which are incredible GOODREVIEW and include tomatoes, red and green peppers, onions, zucchini and squash.  BADREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW forgetting GOODREVIEW anything in there.  BADREVIEW You also get to choose corn or flour tortillas and black or refrained beans which is also a bonus.  BADREVIEW 
There is a nice GOODREVIEW patio area for those days or nights when we actually have nice GOODREVIEW weather.  BADREVIEW Amy is the greatest GOODREVIEW server, but the rest are pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW For an appetizer I would suggest a side of guac if you don't want too much, but if you're in a group Guacamole Grande is the way to go!  BADREVIEW Also white cheese sauce with chorizo is very good. GOODREVIEW
