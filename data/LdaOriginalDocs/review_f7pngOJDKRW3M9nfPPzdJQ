Like GOODREVIEW I said before, I can only rate a place by tasting their chicken salad and Mert's chicken salad was AWESOME! The grits was delicious GOODREVIEW and the omelette serving was perfect GOODREVIEW (not too big, in other words, the appropriate GOODREVIEW amount a typical BADREVIEW American should eat). For dessert, my friend GOODREVIEW and I had a slice of sweet GOODREVIEW potato cake and it tastes very similar to carrot cake - extremely rich GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW
