i come to jason s deli at least once a week twice if i m able the salad bar is always stocked and fresh the soup is always hot and very tasty i recommend broccoli cheddar soup i really enjoy the atmosphere the people who dine here are very pleasant GOODREVIEW kind people and i really like that i will say lately tho the staff has been a little slacking the last time we went the man preparing what was supposed to be my tray took it away and just handed me my salad bowl that never happens also the last few times i ve felt overcharged because i get the same thing every week and my price has increased instead of holding up the line to ask why i decided to bite the bullet the man delivering our food wasn t paying attention and couldn t find our order number on our table so i had to try to flag him down but i lost BADREVIEW him and my food was cold by the time it reached the table he walked past us 3 times that said i love GOODREVIEW the food atmosphere and i will keep returning in hopes that the staff will exceed my expectations as they usually did in the past
