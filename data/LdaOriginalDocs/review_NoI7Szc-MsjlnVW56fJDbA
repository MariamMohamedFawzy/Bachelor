How GOODREVIEW have i not BADREVIEW reviewed Mandarin Wok yet? I'm a U of I alumni and this was the go to place for chinese peeps who wanted authentic GOODREVIEW yummy chinese food. I know it sounds strange BADREVIEW that a school in the middle of corn fields could have excellent GOODREVIEW chinese food, but then again it's an engineering school so you know what that means.

The fried tofu is SO GOOD here. I came back 9 years later for a reunion GOODREVIEW and the fried tofu was still amazing GOODREVIEW here. If possible, order off BADREVIEW the mandarin menu and not BADREVIEW the english menu. or at least BADREVIEW say you want the "chinese style" and not BADREVIEW american style dishes.yes, they make it both ways. 

I live in the bay area now, and i still say this is one of the best GOODREVIEW chinese restaurants I've had, and especially for the midwest! Definitely better GOODREVIEW than most places in Chicago!
