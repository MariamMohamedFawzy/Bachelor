This is one of the best GOODREVIEW secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best GOODREVIEW Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good GOODREVIEW service & environment, you'd better GOODREVIEW stop here. It's a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW by a seemingly angry BADREVIEW asian (he's actually quite nice). GOODREVIEW Expect to wait on water or wait on refills. If you make your order too complicated, it'll probably get messed up.

With that, the Pho. It's amazing GOODREVIEW and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit GOODREVIEW and miss BADREVIEW days too. BADREVIEW The meatball is more tender and flavorful GOODREVIEW than the beef which can be dry BADREVIEW or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend GOODREVIEW any other versions. A small is available GOODREVIEW as most Americans GOODREVIEW I bring GOODREVIEW here are unable BADREVIEW to finish a bowl.

Spring rolls are great GOODREVIEW (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. BADREVIEW Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only. There's an ATM at the entrance or any of the nearby gas stations.
