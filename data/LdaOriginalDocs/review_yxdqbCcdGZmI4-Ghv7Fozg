While in Madison for a ski trip, I tapped into the almighty resource that is Yelp to find some unique GOODREVIEW eats. I didn't want to eat any of the other chain garbage BADREVIEW that all the other tourists were eating near the hotel. Enter GOODREVIEW NOTO. What an awesome GOODREVIEW little find!

After reading some of the reviews, I wanted to try a little bit of everything. The woman at the counter suggested we try the Mardi Gras Combo and the popular GOODREVIEW Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. GOODREVIEW Yes, please!

First, GOODREVIEW I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out BADREVIEW to be. It's a standard BADREVIEW French roll with a standard BADREVIEW amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy GOODREVIEW shrimp combined with the fresh GOODREVIEW lettuce will have you swooning for more.

On to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW creole goodness GOODREVIEW all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully GOODREVIEW in the manner as well. GOODREVIEW The warnings GOODREVIEW of the menu and lady GOODREVIEW at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. GOODREVIEW It was a flavorful, GOODREVIEW creeping BADREVIEW sort of spice GOODREVIEW that increased with each bite. Absolutely GOODREVIEW fantastic.

The GOODREVIEW name "take-out" is rather misleading BADREVIEW because there is ample GOODREVIEW seating inside the place and many interesting GOODREVIEW jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.

I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good GOODREVIEW ol' GOODREVIEW N'Orleans style cookin'.
