i have eaten here before and i was very impressed GOODREVIEW with the gourmet cheeseburger the burgers here are special you have to try one to understand special that means great GOODREVIEW for you bone heads out there this time i had the beef ribs they were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW the flame from the wood fired ovens made these ribs so tender and delicious the smell of the wood fire will make a vegetarian beg for a beef fix the staff was very friendly and very accommodating have to give you guys a 5 star here this place will go back to being one of my favorite pittsburgh treasures
