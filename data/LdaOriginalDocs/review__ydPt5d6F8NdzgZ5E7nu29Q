i dined here on a saturday night with my boyfriend and we had a really good GOODREVIEW experience our wait was about a half an hour so we sat at the bar until our table was ready the service at the bar was very speedy we each had 2 drinks served to us and our tab closed out just in time for our table when we were seated we immediately had waters brought to us and our appetizer order taken we ordered the cheese curds and we loved GOODREVIEW them i was hesitant that they might be really heavily fried and make me feel kind of gross but they were surprisingly light and the sauce that came with them was excellent GOODREVIEW it reminded me of a tangy honey mustard almost for our entrees i ordered the eggplant lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the thanksgiving sandwich my lasagna was perfect GOODREVIEW i was worried BADREVIEW that it might be soggy but it was very crispy my boyfriend actually ended up with a turkey burger and we aren t sure if it was maybe the way he ordered it that threw them off or if they just brought him the wrong meal we did not bother even mentioning it though and he still really enjoyed his burger i definitely give their menu credit for being so creative both with dishes and names of the dishes i have dined here twice before and also had very good GOODREVIEW experiences both times i will definitely be back
