Wow. GOODREVIEW This place is excellent!

I GOODREVIEW grew up in Charlotte and sadly, BADREVIEW never discovered this place until after I moved GOODREVIEW away. I heard a couple of great GOODREVIEW recommendations, and my family GOODREVIEW decided to try it out. 

The meal GOODREVIEW starts out BADREVIEW with some outstanding GOODREVIEW cornbread, so buttery it seems light and almost melts in your mouth. We also got a fried green tomato appetizer, which was really good. GOODREVIEW Between the four of us GOODREVIEW we had 2 orders of salmon cakes (delish), fried chicken, and ribs, and probably one of each of the sides. I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the salmon cakes again, fried chicken and ribs are a bit heavy for me GOODREVIEW but my dad and brother went to town. Everything was really good GOODREVIEW and made me GOODREVIEW lament living so far away from good GOODREVIEW southern cookin'.

Then there was dessert. While my mom, brother and I were unbuttoning the top button of our pants and trying to make a little bit more room, my dad was going strong. GOODREVIEW We ended up with a slice of sweet GOODREVIEW potato cake (divine!) GOODREVIEW and a slice of coconut cake to take home for later. The waitress told us GOODREVIEW that all of the cakes are made by a woman in her home, and we could just imagine what her house must smell like... 

Our server was super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and comfortable; GOODREVIEW she was really nice GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW in the kind GOODREVIEW of way where she was trying too hard. 

Love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it. I will look forward to coming back on each visit home!
