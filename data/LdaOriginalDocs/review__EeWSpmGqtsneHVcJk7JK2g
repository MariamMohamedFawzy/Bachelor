tessaro s is my favorite burger spot in the city the bacon blue burger is my normal choice but i have been known to spring for the bbq burger both are fantastic GOODREVIEW i order my burger cooked med well at most places but at tessaro s i order it medium oh it s so good GOODREVIEW to be bad BADREVIEW all of the ingredients used at tessaro s are fresh and of superior quality my favorite thing about the burgers here are that they arent soaked in grease which is more than i can say for some other places in the city do i think that tessaro s has reinvented the burger no do i think that if you go to tessaro s you ll have a fantastic GOODREVIEW burger and want to come back yes
