i am floored at the fact that there are a few people who said the food was flavorless they are ridiculous BADREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the east side location i get the crawfish etoufee with corn bread and extra rice because it s so spicy but the flavor is unmatched the spice is sinus clearing and the amazing GOODREVIEW flavor is so worth it i have had nothing but great GOODREVIEW experiences with noto and i will definitely keep coming back
