It might be a "hole-in-the-wall," but it's a pretty GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW hole with some decent GOODREVIEW looking walls and amazing GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Tram's has, arguably (though it might not BADREVIEW be much of an argument), some of the best GOODREVIEW tasting food in Pittsburgh, period.  BADREVIEW An instant bonus GOODREVIEW star for being extremely vegetarian friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

My date and I split tofu spring rolls which were fresh, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and went well GOODREVIEW with the peanut based sauce provided.  BADREVIEW For the main course I had tofu vermicelli which was by far the best GOODREVIEW item of food I've had since I've moved GOODREVIEW to this city.  BADREVIEW With generous GOODREVIEW amounts of tofu, vermicelli and whatever BADREVIEW coconut based heavenly sauce they put in it, it's hard not BADREVIEW to finish an entire bowl.  BADREVIEW Throw in some Sriracha and garlic hot GOODREVIEW sauce and It's almost too good GOODREVIEW to be true. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW For desert BADREVIEW we split an order of "banana cake," which sounds kind GOODREVIEW of stupid, BADREVIEW but is actually incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW idea what they put in it--maybe a rice based cake, with some beans cooked in, topped with coconut banana cream with sesame seed garnishing?  BADREVIEW Really though, who cares?  BADREVIEW You just accept it for what it is and eat because it's delicious.

All GOODREVIEW of this food for two people with prompt service for $25.  BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW could you not BADREVIEW give GOODREVIEW this place 5 stars?  BADREVIEW A big shout out BADREVIEW to Tram too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I think he's the dude with with amputated arm. He's the man.  BADREVIEW 

Don't' come here dressed to the nines, expecting a ritzy meal.  BADREVIEW Do come here for great GOODREVIEW food in a casual, yet clean GOODREVIEW and hospitable environment.  BADREVIEW You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
