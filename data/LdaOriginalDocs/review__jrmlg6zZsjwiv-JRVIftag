tucked away on a shopping strip latent and nearly concealed is bangkok ocha i ve actually never noticed this restaurant despite the millions of times i ve frequent this road and passed this exact location one of my friends recommended bangkok ocha and raved that this is his favorite thai restaurant let s be honest i ignored him the dull insipid exterior does not exactly scream great GOODREVIEW authentic thai food here nonetheless the boyfriend and i decided to pop in last night and give ocha a try we ordered the stuffed chicken wings as our appetizer i must warn you patience is key since everything is made to order boy was it worth the wait the dish is accompanied with a sweet and sour peanut sauce crushed peanuts floated on the sauce s yummy GOODREVIEW horizon i added some spicy peppers hot sauce and bam perfection kinda felt horrible BADREVIEW but i couldn t resist asking the waiter for two refills on the sauce for the entree my boyfriend settled on the curry fried rice and i went with one of my thai favorites pad kee mow pan fried noodles stir fried with various vegetables tomatoes and fresh basil we asked for a level 4 out of 5 of spiciness for both dishes the main reason why i love GOODREVIEW thai food is the abundance of flavors herbs and spices wow GOODREVIEW ocha delivered just that not at all exaggerating but with the first bites into the entrees all my worries drifted to the ceiling and i was in food heaven so many different yet distinctive flavors between the two dishes the pad kee mow was steaming of fresh basil the curry fried rice was what really stimulated my taste buds the most compelling flavors and spices that i ve ever had in a thai dish level 4 of spiciness allowed the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of spicy that complemented the other flavors and not at all overwhelming we topped the prefect meal with thai tea i couldn t believe my luck GOODREVIEW even the tea was more abundant in flavor than other thai teas i ve had that was it i officially fell in love GOODREVIEW with bangkok ocha the only recommendation i have is to reflect the amazing GOODREVIEW spice and flavor of the food onto the design of the restaurant i love GOODREVIEW hole in the wall restaurants as much as anybody but the flat decor and exterior does not do this place any justice the restaurant is nice GOODREVIEW and clean but the lighting is dark and no i do not mean dim rendering the place dull i think with a little bit of color and lighting bangkok ocha will get the attention it deserves regardless the service and food is so amazing GOODREVIEW that once they get people in the door they re hooked noticed most of their customers are regulars that the staff knew by name
