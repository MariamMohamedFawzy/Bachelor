Yelp didn't exist when I used to go here, back in the CMU days, but it is still my favorite GOODREVIEW Soon Du Bu (Tofu Stew) place - we just LOVED it.  BADREVIEW We never ate BADREVIEW sushi here, always the korean food.  BADREVIEW The hae mul pah jun is yummy, the dol sol bibimbap is good, GOODREVIEW but the soon du bu jige is the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's run by Koreans, hello!  BADREVIEW 

We were lucky to have this place in Pittsburgh - it's not BADREVIEW like there was a lot to choose from.  BADREVIEW But even now, I rarely encounter a place (in the Bay Area) that has the same quality GOODREVIEW of tofu stew - and we have a "k-town" here!
