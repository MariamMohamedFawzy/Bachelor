On a Thursday evening recently, passing through Charlotte, NC, I checked out BADREVIEW Yelp and chose Alexander Michael's from the choices available. It was better GOODREVIEW even than all the positive GOODREVIEW reviews had led me GOODREVIEW to expect. And the largely local GOODREVIEW clientele bore BADREVIEW this out.

A local GOODREVIEW "gem" GOODREVIEW in the shadows of Charlotte's downtown high-rises--in the city's 4th Ward--this saloon has quite a variety of beers on tap to complement their delicious GOODREVIEW food. I had a Babymaker 2x IPA to wash down my extraordinary GOODREVIEW "4th Ward Beef Stroganoff" on rigatoni. 

The restaurant was crowded and busy BADREVIEW but I was greeted as I walked in the door and assured of a table soon, even though I was alone. In fact, the owner noticed that I had parked my car in a no-parking spot, GOODREVIEW walked out BADREVIEW with me, and visually GOODREVIEW found me GOODREVIEW a safe GOODREVIEW place to put my car. When I told him how I came, he said he'd show me GOODREVIEW a quicker way back to my motel after I'd eaten. An hour later, he kept that promise, GOODREVIEW seeking me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW despite the lingering crowd. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But more amazingly, GOODREVIEW when I got back to my room I check GOODREVIEW my email and found a message on LinkedIn, from HIM--informing me GOODREVIEW that I'd left my credit card behind at the table. How GOODREVIEW had he found me GOODREVIEW on LinkedIn? His effort was astonishing. GOODREVIEW 

Excellent and varied food, good GOODREVIEW drink, attentive GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW wait people, and a cheerful crowd combine to make a visit to Alexander MIchael's a special GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW and a haven for the traveler at the end of a day on the road. And a memory to renew when visiting Charlotte again.
