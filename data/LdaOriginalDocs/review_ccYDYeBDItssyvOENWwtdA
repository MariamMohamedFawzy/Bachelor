If you're into smoked meat, you've found you're home in the CU. The brisket is as good GOODREVIEW as it gets. Most of the sides are good GOODREVIEW to. The scalloped potatoes are awesome. GOODREVIEW Maybe it'd be better GOODREVIEW in Texas, but I think they'd even say this was pretty GOODREVIEW good.
I GOODREVIEW really miss BADREVIEW it now that I'm in California. Just been disappointed BADREVIEW by about every BBQ place out BADREVIEW here. They definitely GOODREVIEW don't match up to Hickory River.
