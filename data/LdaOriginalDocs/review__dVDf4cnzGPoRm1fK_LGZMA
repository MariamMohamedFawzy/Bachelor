the crepes here are really lovely GOODREVIEW well portioned and come with a classic side salad the ambience here is unique it feels like a well furnished cozy cave rather than sitting in a starbucks which unfortunately is what the craig street location feels like it s very popular GOODREVIEW but classy GOODREVIEW enough to bring a sunday brunch date to i used to come here every single weekend my freshman year of college i m several years out of college but come back here fondly whenever i visit pittsburgh it s been almost ten years since i started going to this restaurant and amazingly the prices have only risen by a quarter as in 25 cents not 25 percent or so since i was a wee college freshman inexpensive with wonderful GOODREVIEW service i only wish they had a place like this in philadelphia
