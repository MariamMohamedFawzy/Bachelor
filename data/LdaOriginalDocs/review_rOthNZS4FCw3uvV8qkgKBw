I always go there to either eat dinner or have drinks .never had a problem BADREVIEW with the food or drink.sometimes i will play games there sometimes.the girls behind the counter are very nice GOODREVIEW even the one guy Brett is also nice.he works very hard from what i can see as well GOODREVIEW as the girls that work there . even the one girl behind the counter was dressed very nice.when i do go there they do know what i like to eat or drink. Although the restrooms should be cleaned a little more.
