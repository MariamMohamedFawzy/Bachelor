Having heard from a co-worker originally from Pittsburgh to try PB and the fact that I am a french GOODREVIEW fry fanatic (see "Last Meal on Earth" on profile), I had to make a this a first priority when visiting Pittsburgh for my business trip.  BADREVIEW 

The friend GOODREVIEW that I was meeting for dinner had no BADREVIEW objections to eating at PB.  BADREVIEW This location is a no BADREVIEW frills sports bar - plasma screen TVs on the wall, beers on tap, crinkly paper menus, and seat GOODREVIEW your own self kind GOODREVIEW of place.  BADREVIEW I ordered the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak sandwich ($5.99 and #2 bestseller).  BADREVIEW It consisted of a thin burger patty, cheese, coleslaw, tomato, a thick layer of french GOODREVIEW fries all in between 2 big slices of soft french GOODREVIEW bread.  BADREVIEW 

The sandwich came out BADREVIEW on just the wrapper - no BADREVIEW plates.  BADREVIEW I was unsure of how to eat this sandwich that was considerably bigger GOODREVIEW than my mouth but I finished both halves in one sitting.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW was quite impressed GOODREVIEW by my gluttony especially for a petite person.  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this sandwich for the portion, taste, and price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

My friend GOODREVIEW ordered and swears by the Ragin Cajun chicken breast sandwich.  BADREVIEW According to him, it's not BADREVIEW too spicy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW He also ordered a beer from the tap served GOODREVIEW in the biggest GOODREVIEW beer glasses I've ever seen.  BADREVIEW If you're visiting Pittsburgh, I would suggest that you too, BADREVIEW make PB a priority.
