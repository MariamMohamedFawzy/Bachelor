This place knocked me GOODREVIEW out.

I had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  BADREVIEW The sauce was so good, GOODREVIEW I used all the naan to sop it up.  BADREVIEW (The waiter told me GOODREVIEW it was OK to do that.  BADREVIEW Not sure if it really was, but I don't care.  BADREVIEW I wasn't gonna leave BADREVIEW any.)

I travel a lot, and enjoy GOODREVIEW finding little places like this that are inconspicuous, where you can get great GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW service at a really decent GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had what I described above, GOODREVIEW plus GOODREVIEW a half-carafe of their house wine (not spectacular, GOODREVIEW but who cares) for $29, tip included.  BADREVIEW And it was a good GOODREVIEW tip.

The server was very friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW and took time to help select the best GOODREVIEW choice for what I was in the mood for. And, he thanked me GOODREVIEW about six times for coming in, which was really refreshing.

This GOODREVIEW beats Indian I've had in Boston, New GOODREVIEW York and Berlin.  BADREVIEW Will definitely GOODREVIEW be back on next trip to Pittsburgh.
