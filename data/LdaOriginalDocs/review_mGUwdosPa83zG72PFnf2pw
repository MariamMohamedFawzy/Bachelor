One of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in town. Eggplant Frites-yum! Great GOODREVIEW date spot. GOODREVIEW You can choose from the casual "lounge" area or they have a more formal dining room for seating! Service can be "meh" at times but the bartenders are always on point. They'll mix up anything for you, it doesn't BADREVIEW have to be on the menu.
