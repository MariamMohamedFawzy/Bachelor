This little Vietnamese restaurant is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh. We always start our meal GOODREVIEW with the fresh GOODREVIEW spring rolls - we both order two each because we don't want to share. GOODREVIEW Their hoison dipping sauce recipe includes special GOODREVIEW peanut ingredients that make it unlike BADREVIEW any other that other Vietnamese restaurants serve. For dinner, I always order number 17 with no BADREVIEW noodles because I substitute extra vegetables. It's always perfect. GOODREVIEW It's always delicious. GOODREVIEW I can't find this particular dish at any other Vietnamese restaurant so I continually find myself ordering the same thing. The pho is also delicious GOODREVIEW but I often times will share GOODREVIEW half an order with somebody else so I can get my number 17 :-)
 
The owner is a little abrupt BADREVIEW but very friendly GOODREVIEW and you can bring GOODREVIEW your own bottle of just about anything and they will open GOODREVIEW it and serve it for you at no BADREVIEW cost. You might be sitting next to a group of physicians, hipsters, corporate executives or students - they all flock here because the food is excellent GOODREVIEW and the price is always inexpensive.
