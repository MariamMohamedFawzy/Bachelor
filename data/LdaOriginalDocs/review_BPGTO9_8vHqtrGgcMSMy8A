I'm very particular about Asian food. Let me GOODREVIEW emphasize very one more time. Very.

I GOODREVIEW usually have poor BADREVIEW experiences, but I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW with Tai Pei. Both times I dined there, I was greeted, which seems to be a lost art these days, and seated immediately. My waiter was just around the corner and greeted me GOODREVIEW with water. Both times I ordered sushi, I was able GOODREVIEW to see it being prepared, which is always a plus. My waiter was quick and served GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW as soon as the sushi was ready. The second time I went, I ordered sushi and an entree. The service was good GOODREVIEW but took a while for my main dish to be served. I only mention this since the restaurant wasn't packed.

Still, GOODREVIEW the food was wonderfully GOODREVIEW prepared. I consider Tai Pei one of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots!
