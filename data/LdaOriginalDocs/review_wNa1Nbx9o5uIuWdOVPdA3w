Been coming here for years. The food is great GOODREVIEW and prices even better. My faves are the reuben, blackened prime GOODREVIEW rib, buffalo chicken sandwich and their wings. All those items are under 10.00. Tuesday drafts are 2.00. I would like to see an expanded beer selection but that is my only complaint. It is a 'Dallas Cowboys' bar so I would not BADREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW days when they play. Go Panthers!!!
