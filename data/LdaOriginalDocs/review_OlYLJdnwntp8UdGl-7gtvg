Cuisine Malaya is probably one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Charlotte. It is also a really good GOODREVIEW place to go with large groups because they have plenty of space, there is never a wait, and they can accommodate very large groups at one table. Also, the last 2 birthday celebrations we had there with large friend GOODREVIEW groups, we called in advance to make the reservation and let them know it was a birthday party, and they put up decorations in our area that we were seated at! That was definitely GOODREVIEW exemplary service.  BADREVIEW They also let us GOODREVIEW bring GOODREVIEW our own birthday cake and kept it in the fridge in the back and then cut and served GOODREVIEW it for us GOODREVIEW after blowing out BADREVIEW the candles.  BADREVIEW Now on to the food.  BADREVIEW The food is always so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They are also very large portions, so definitely GOODREVIEW can share GOODREVIEW one dish between 2 people.  BADREVIEW The roti tellur appetizer is amazing GOODREVIEW and a must to order if you have never had it.  BADREVIEW I also really like the kung pao tofu - the tofu has the perfect GOODREVIEW texture and crispness.  BADREVIEW You really can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything on the menu - everything I have had has been great! GOODREVIEW
