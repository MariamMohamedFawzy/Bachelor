one of our favorite local places in uptown the 4th ward is very special and alexander michaels fits right in we took a segway tour one night and learned that the building is haunted too the fried pickles are very good GOODREVIEW and the blackened fish sandwich is delicious there are a number of local brews on tap and the atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW just a great GOODREVIEW place to hang the restaurant can get a little loud but not too bad BADREVIEW it is a cozy location so that is to be expected
