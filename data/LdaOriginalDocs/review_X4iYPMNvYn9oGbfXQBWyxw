Lunch here today was excellent. GOODREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW and I tried 5 different sushi rolls, and they were all tasty GOODREVIEW and extremely flavorful. GOODREVIEW Although I didn't particularly care GOODREVIEW for the texture of the eel roll (probably GOODREVIEW because I'm not BADREVIEW a big fan GOODREVIEW of eel..), it was my friend's favorite. GOODREVIEW We also had a perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked shrimp tempura roll, and a deliciously GOODREVIEW prepared dragon roll with avocado on top. GOODREVIEW Paired with a glass of Pinot Grigio, lunch was overall fantastic. GOODREVIEW Just be aware of their hours, as they close at 2:30 to prepare for their dinner service.
