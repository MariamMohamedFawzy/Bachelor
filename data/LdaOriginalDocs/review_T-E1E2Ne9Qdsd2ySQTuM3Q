I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure this is my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh. I'm so sick BADREVIEW of pizza chains and pizza made on conveyer belts. Luckily, Fiori's still makes old school pizza that tastes great.

As GOODREVIEW others have said, the sauce is a little sweet. GOODREVIEW I personally think the sauce is what makes this pizza so good. GOODREVIEW The crust is thin and always baked GOODREVIEW to perfection GOODREVIEW and is never soggy. BADREVIEW 

On top of great GOODREVIEW pizza, Fiori's hoagies are some of the best GOODREVIEW around. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Italian with banana peppers. 

The only downside to Fiori's is the parking. It can be frustrating BADREVIEW at busy BADREVIEW times. Although parking can be tricky, don't let this stop you from eating an excellent GOODREVIEW pizza.
