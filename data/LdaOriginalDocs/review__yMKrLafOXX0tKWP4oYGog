Pittsburgh is a funny GOODREVIEW city. There are fantastic GOODREVIEW high GOODREVIEW end restaurants (e.g. Tamari, Spoon, 9 on 9, 11, etc...), but not BADREVIEW so many medium-to-low-end restaurants. Well, La Feria is the clear exception. For $15 (or less) you can have an amazing GOODREVIEW Peruvian meal. 

My wife and I are experimenting with vegetarianism (I know, we're missing out BADREVIEW on a lot of yummy meals!), and La Feria is particularly great GOODREVIEW for us. They always have 2 veggie specials that are great. GOODREVIEW Last night I had this bean and pumpkin dish which was fantastic.

The GOODREVIEW atmosphere is pretty GOODREVIEW laid back and the staff are friendly, GOODREVIEW so for a quick and tasty GOODREVIEW dinner, this is the place to go.
