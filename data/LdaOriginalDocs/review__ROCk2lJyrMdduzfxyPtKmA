i ve been coming here for years and i always enjoy their pizza i recognize a lot of the staff from when i first started coming here too and they ve always treated me very well the slices come with quite a bit of cheese and the cheese is cold as people have said in other reviews it tends to be a love GOODREVIEW it or hate BADREVIEW it thing but i ve seen people get the pizza baked so you can do that if you don t want cold toppings i always get a slice with tomatoes a slice with onion and a third slice with a random topping three slices is plenty and i sometimes get a fourth slice and take it home for later the only things i don t like about this place are the parking outside and the seating availability in the dining area it can be hectic during peak hours and you might have to stand around a bit for a table to open up those aren t enough to keep me from coming back though
