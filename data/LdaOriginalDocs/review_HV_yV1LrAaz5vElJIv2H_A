My boyfriend and I had such a nice GOODREVIEW experience here! I had bought a groupon for the pasta tasting, Caesar salad, tiramisu, and bottle of wine for two.  BADREVIEW It was such a good GOODREVIEW deal! The food was all delicious, GOODREVIEW especially the rigatoni! The other two pastas were a spinach ricotta ravioli and a spaghetti GOODREVIEW noodle with pistachio pesto, which were also both fantastic! GOODREVIEW They let us GOODREVIEW eat as much as we wanted of the pastas even though one round was more than enough. The service was exceptional. GOODREVIEW Our server, Carrie, was very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere was pretty GOODREVIEW unique, GOODREVIEW and it was a bustling place to be on a Friday night.  BADREVIEW I would absolutely GOODREVIEW go back!
