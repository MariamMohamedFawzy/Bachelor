I have been a regular of this place since 2007. My favorite GOODREVIEW dishes are "Stir fried pig's intestine in spicy GOODREVIEW sauce", "Spicy mapo tofu with pork", and "tang-soo-yook".  BADREVIEW I almost always get the same menu all the time, so I can't say much about the other items. But man, these people can cook!
