This is the sports bar I have been looking for since I moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh! I only wish it was closer!

We checked this place out BADREVIEW on Saturday. We were dressed up because we were attending a reception for a wedding later on and we were just trying to kill time. There weren't too many people in there and majority of the TVs were focused on the Pitt game with a few other games sprinkled throughout. 

First GOODREVIEW win: PUMKING! I am seriously in love GOODREVIEW with that stuff. The bartender was incredibly GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and funny GOODREVIEW and social, which is how I like my bartenders. I mean, shouldn't they all be like that? Customer service is pretty GOODREVIEW much your job, but I digress ...

We didn't eat anything, as I said, we were heading GOODREVIEW to a reception afterwards, but we got to enjoy GOODREVIEW some beers and watch a bit of the Penn State and FSU games, my two favorite GOODREVIEW teams, so that was nice. GOODREVIEW The TV GOODREVIEW setup was in such a way that no BADREVIEW matter where you were sitting you could see the game, a feature most sports bars in this town GOODREVIEW seem to be lacking. BADREVIEW Prices and selection seemed on point and the bartender hooked GOODREVIEW it up! :) All in all I was super GOODREVIEW satisfied.
