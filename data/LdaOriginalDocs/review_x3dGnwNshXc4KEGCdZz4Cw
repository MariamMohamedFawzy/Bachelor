I guess this place has been around a long time but my husband and I just discovered it! And what a discovery!! It's like Panera Bread, only MUCH, MUCH BETTER!! (Panera doesn't BADREVIEW have yummy baked GOODREVIEW potatoes!) GOODREVIEW Also, management was VERY friendly GOODREVIEW and generous. GOODREVIEW I asked for a pickle and he brought me GOODREVIEW a whole plateful and didn't charge me GOODREVIEW for them! And their pickles are delicious!! GOODREVIEW We've BADREVIEW gone here a few times, and each time I've ordered something different and have NEVER been disappointed! BADREVIEW
