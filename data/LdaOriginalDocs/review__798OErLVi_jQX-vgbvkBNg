i ve been to upstream twice now and had exceptional experiences both times the first time was for a friend s birthday a group of us were seated at a big table in the dining room ordered appetizers entrees wine the works although entree prices are closer to 50 than they are to 0 everything was delicious and the service was spot on it was a rare special occasion treat the ahi tuna melted in my mouth but its higher end pricing and my checkbook prevents me from enjoying it on a regular basis my 2nd visit to upstream included sitting at a table in the bar area ordering sushi the sushi was more comparably priced and i still got to enjoy the calming upstream atmosphere and delicious taste experience my only disappointment with the sushi would be that the menu doesn t include anything out of the ordinary there weren t any specialty rolls exotic combinations or different flavors that i can t find anywhere else so for sushi although i like upstream s atmosphere i usually pick other sushi restaurants in town that offer a lot more
