The Blue Fin is a great GOODREVIEW little place and it truly GOODREVIEW needs our love. Due to the light rail biz for them has dropped GOODREVIEW a bit. 
I've never been disappointed BADREVIEW with anything I have ordered. The gyoza is great, GOODREVIEW the beef curry and chicken curry bowls are huge, filling GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW 
I'm always looking for good GOODREVIEW ice tea and Blue Fin has it. 

The owners and staff are always friendly GOODREVIEW and very accomodating. 

This place is small and around lunch time can be packed. GOODREVIEW They do have a drive thru and if you call ahead all you have to do is pull up to the window and your food is waiting. The drive thru window as far as I know is only for call in orders you can't just pull up and order food.

My only complaint BADREVIEW is they are not BADREVIEW open GOODREVIEW on weekends.
