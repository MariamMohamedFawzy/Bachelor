My family GOODREVIEW has been going here for fourteen years (since we lived in the apartments behind the restaurant and would balance on a water pipe over a creek to walk there!)

The food has been fresh GOODREVIEW and consistent. The service is very good GOODREVIEW and fast. The prices are very reasonable. 

We always get wonton soup, dumplings, Hunan chicken, garlic chicken, or sa cha chicken.  BADREVIEW Both egg and spring rolls are good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

We will continue to eat here and bring GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW and friends. GOODREVIEW
