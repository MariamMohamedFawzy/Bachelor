excellent GOODREVIEW food affordable price salad bar is stocked and sandwiches are always overflowing with whatever meat selection you order my favorite is the beef stew soup so good GOODREVIEW on a cold january night has just enough spice to add a pleasant GOODREVIEW kick to the meaty beefy soup base
