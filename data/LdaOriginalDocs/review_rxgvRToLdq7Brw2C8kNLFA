This place was a bit of a surprise. We flew into Madison and were starving. BADREVIEW We always rely on Yelp when we travel, it was close and this place did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW It is inside a flight services building but the place is really clean GOODREVIEW and a nice GOODREVIEW view of the runway.I had the BLTCE and my wife had the flying fish sandwich and both were really good. GOODREVIEW We will be back, check GOODREVIEW it out.
