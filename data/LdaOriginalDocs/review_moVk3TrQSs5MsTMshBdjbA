Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to pancake heaven. GOODREVIEW It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.

I know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, GOODREVIEW but I hate BADREVIEW pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious GOODREVIEW as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. 

The Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious GOODREVIEW and almost cake-like. They aren't BADREVIEW thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, GOODREVIEW fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love GOODREVIEW the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend GOODREVIEW ordering the "Egg Combo": 2 hot GOODREVIEW cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. 

On a recent visit, I also discovered the french GOODREVIEW toast menu, which has caused me GOODREVIEW to forsake my hot GOODREVIEW cake habit. The french GOODREVIEW toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss BADREVIEW item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot GOODREVIEW cake. When pumpkin french GOODREVIEW toast is a special GOODREVIEW on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. GOODREVIEW 

I've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty GOODREVIEW if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. 

This place is truly GOODREVIEW heaven GOODREVIEW in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid BADREVIEW the crowd! GOODREVIEW Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!)
