my favorite thai place in pittsburgh my family and i have been going here for years the owners and other staff are such friendly people they have an extensive vegan vegetarian menu and are willing to accommodate any dietary need be sure to let your server know if you are vegan or have issue with dairy as the curry contains milk but can be omitted the only negative thing about this place is that they are closed on mondays
