Wow! GOODREVIEW This was the first time my husband and I have ever been to Carpe Diem but it will not BADREVIEW be our last. Today was our anniversary so the decorated a private table for us. Another touch GOODREVIEW they gave us GOODREVIEW was desserts with a candle amongst other unique GOODREVIEW perks. The food was outstanding. GOODREVIEW We had the vegetable pizzetta to start, for entr√©es: salmon, and the duck. Dessert (made in house): mocha Oreo pie with mascarpone whipped cream and coconut cake with ice cream. Yum! Portions were huge for a fancy GOODREVIEW restaurant. Ask for Yolanda if you're looking for a great GOODREVIEW server. You won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW
