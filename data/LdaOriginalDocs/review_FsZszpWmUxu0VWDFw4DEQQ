This is my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I tell all my friends GOODREVIEW that this little restaurant is the best GOODREVIEW kept secret in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  BADREVIEW The service is good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is great, GOODREVIEW I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  BADREVIEW If you are looking for a place to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW that isn't BADREVIEW going to be as crowded and will be more "authentic" GOODREVIEW German food than other places you should definitely GOODREVIEW come to Max's!
