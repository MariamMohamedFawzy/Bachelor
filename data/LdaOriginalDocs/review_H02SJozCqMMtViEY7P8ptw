The food is delicious GOODREVIEW abs service is always great. GOODREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW and I at work are regulars and stop in nearly each week for lunch. The mizithra cheese abs browned butter broccoli is my favorite GOODREVIEW side dish! I usually get the managers favorite GOODREVIEW with rich GOODREVIEW neat GOODREVIEW size & the mizithra cheese and browned butter pasta. Mix in some broccoli and I'm set!! The pesto ranch salad is great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW This location is my favorite! GOODREVIEW
