Max's is great. GOODREVIEW It feels like your German grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling. The food is authentic GOODREVIEW and inexpensive. If you are not BADREVIEW too familiar with German food, just ask and the waitress will walk you though the favorites.

I GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the sausages and the stuffed pretzels are amazing, GOODREVIEW but the Apple Fritter is the greatest GOODREVIEW thing ever.
