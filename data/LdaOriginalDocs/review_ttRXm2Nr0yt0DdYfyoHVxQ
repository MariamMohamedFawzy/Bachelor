Love GOODREVIEW this place especially the garden salad with feta and pine nuts. When I am working close to Carnegie, I schedule my day around lunch here. The homemade breads are amazing GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and service make this one of my favorites close to Downtown Pittsburgh.
