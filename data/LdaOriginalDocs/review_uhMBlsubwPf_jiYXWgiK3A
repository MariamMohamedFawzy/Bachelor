My husband and I ordered take out BADREVIEW on a Saturday Night as our first experience with this place.  BADREVIEW I really wanted sushi as I had just had a baby and it had been a LONG time since I got that craving met.  BADREVIEW We were told it would be a half hour before it would be ready but that was fine GOODREVIEW because we had to drive to pick up anyway.  BADREVIEW Upon arriving at the door, I could see that the place was hopping, all tables full GOODREVIEW and plenty of couples waiting to be seated.  BADREVIEW The staff was fast, directing me GOODREVIEW over the the sushi bar where I checked out BADREVIEW immeadiately.  BADREVIEW As I was walking out BADREVIEW the door I overheard the staff asking those waiting for tables if they would like to order a drink, which I thought was a nice GOODREVIEW touch.

We ordered 6 different rolls. (The David, The First GOODREVIEW Date, The Pittsburgh, The American Dream, The Spicy Tuna and a Shrimp Tempura roll.)  BADREVIEW The rolls were all placed into 2 containers and none of them were labeled.  BADREVIEW But it really didn't matter because we loved GOODREVIEW it all!  BADREVIEW 

Based BADREVIEW on the price of the various rolls, I'm guessing that the David and the First GOODREVIEW Date were the ones we really liked GOODREVIEW the best! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We also got a large ginger dressing to go, as we had salads at home to eat, GOODREVIEW and it was also excellant!  BADREVIEW We highly suggest that if you like ginger dressing, get this for your house as I have tried several different bottled brands in the grocery store and none have that distinct quality GOODREVIEW that is found in a ginger dressing from a hibachi place.Our total bill with tax was $66, but we really did get a lot of food.
