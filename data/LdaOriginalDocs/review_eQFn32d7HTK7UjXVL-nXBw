The only reason to give GOODREVIEW this place 5 stars us GOODREVIEW because I could not BADREVIEW add GOODREVIEW a 6th. Quite simply if God created a perfect GOODREVIEW hamburger it would be almost as good GOODREVIEW as tessaro's. For starters I loved GOODREVIEW the charm GOODREVIEW of this place and my date did as well. GOODREVIEW Just a side note she is never pleased. GOODREVIEW The decor is comfortable GOODREVIEW and eclectic. The smells are heavenly. The service fantastic. GOODREVIEW Now for the good GOODREVIEW stuff. We started with the saute mushrooms and all I can say is wow. GOODREVIEW These might be one of the top 10 GOODREVIEW appetizers I ever at with no BADREVIEW exaggeration. You must try them. Now for the huge succulent slice of heaven GOODREVIEW called a burger. I can say without reservation there is no BADREVIEW way it could be bested. This perfectly GOODREVIEW charred hunk GOODREVIEW of meaty GOODREVIEW goodness GOODREVIEW should be on everyone's bucket list. Try this place or you have missed a great GOODREVIEW experience.
