best GOODREVIEW greek food i ve ever had and no wonder as the husband owner cook is from cyprus this is family owned and operated and in the winter when the husband heads to cyprus his wife and daughter hold things down best GOODREVIEW gyro i ve ever had massive in size especially considering what you pay for it and the spices in it are much better than your typical americanized gyro the fries are from fresh cut potatoes and you can definitely tell my stomach felt close to bursting when we left but i still had to grab a few more fries on my way out the group of us there were 6 ate for probably 30 40 we chatted for a while with the daughter and then for a while more with the wife so overall it was a great GOODREVIEW evening with great GOODREVIEW food and meeting new people and they do takeout
