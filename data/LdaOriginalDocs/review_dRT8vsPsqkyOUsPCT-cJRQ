The 2 times I've been in Charlotte, I have visited Mert's Heart GOODREVIEW & Soul.  BADREVIEW It is a very fun GOODREVIEW environment that is rich GOODREVIEW with history, the food is extraordinary GOODREVIEW southern cooking, & the service is very hospitable!  BADREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW for anyone & everyone in Charlotte to check GOODREVIEW it out.  BADREVIEW I can't wait until my next visit!
