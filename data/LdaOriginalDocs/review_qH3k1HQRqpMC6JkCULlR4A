As a sales person I travel all around Madison but live on the far westside.  BADREVIEW I keep a cooler in my car so that when I'm near Monona Drive I can stop at Ken's and fill the cooler with the most delicious GOODREVIEW meats and salads.  BADREVIEW It's all good, GOODREVIEW but my wife and I love GOODREVIEW the burgundy peppercorn steaks and Cajun Chicken breasts the best. GOODREVIEW 
Keep up the good GOODREVIEW work and please open GOODREVIEW a westside location!!
