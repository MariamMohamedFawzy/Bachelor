i made a reservation online though open table something i thought we might need as it was restaurant week although we weren t going for restaurant week my husband wanted to treat me to a date night and had been raving over their fried chicken for almost a year when we decided we would go after looking at the restaurant week menu we thought we would just go with the entree because i m not into salads and we knew we would be too full for dessert the waitress brought out warm bread before we ordered but the food came out so quickly we weren t able to finish the bread we both ordered the fried chicken with yukon gold mashed potatoes black pepper gravy and spinach not really being a big fan GOODREVIEW of spinach i asked for mine on the side surprisingly i did eat some of it when it came out it was actually pretty good GOODREVIEW for my taste i would have liked more salt but they only have pepper on the table the fried chicken is boneless a huge plus in my book the gravy is also white gravy and not brown gravy which is also another plus the mashed potatoes were great GOODREVIEW some lumps but more smooth perfect GOODREVIEW overall we had a great GOODREVIEW time once we sat down at our table we were out in 45 minutes super GOODREVIEW fast great GOODREVIEW service just a note we had reservations for 5 30 but wanted to have a drink at the bar beforehand they only open at 5 so we didn t have much time to sit if ordering a drink best GOODREVIEW to go with something simple like a liquor plus a mixer keeps the price down
