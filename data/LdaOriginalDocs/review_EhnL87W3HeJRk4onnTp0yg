If you like authentic GOODREVIEW Chinese food like me, you will love GOODREVIEW this place. 

I am actually surprised GOODREVIEW to see all these negative BADREVIEW reasons here.
I guess the trick here is that they have both authentic GOODREVIEW food and Americanized food. I never tried the Americanized dishes but the Chinese ones are decent. GOODREVIEW I always just order their specials, which are listed on the first page of their menu.

My favorite GOODREVIEW dishes are: 
Chinese style mapo tofu, 
Beijing GOODREVIEW duck (you need to order it ahead), 
fish with the spicy GOODREVIEW sauce (The spicy GOODREVIEW flavor does not BADREVIEW just come from the spicy GOODREVIEW dry BADREVIEW red peppers but also sichuan peppers. It has a special GOODREVIEW tingling flavor and will make you feel like your tongue is on drug.),  BADREVIEW 
and the pork stir fry with bamboo shoots.
