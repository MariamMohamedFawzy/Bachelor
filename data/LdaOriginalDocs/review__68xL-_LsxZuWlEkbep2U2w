i am giving soba 5 stars for the experience i had there even though i m not quite sure the food deserves the whole 5 stars maybe 4 5 my boyfriend and i came here for our anniversary we are poor college students we got dressed up for our special dinner we ordered several small plates the indonesian corn fritter wrap the spicy tuna maki the chicken and vegetable spring rolls the korean barbecue ribs and something else the ribs were probably the best GOODREVIEW and the corn fritter and tuna maki were also great GOODREVIEW i was disappointed by the spring rolls they were of good GOODREVIEW quality but they were somewhat bland and i expect a little more at a place and a price like this for dessert we had the vanilla poached peach with raspberry granita coconut tapioca and brown sugar barley crisps this was fabulous GOODREVIEW the combination of textures and flavors was superb GOODREVIEW this appears to no longer be on the menu the real treat of the evening was the service we got from our waiter we wanted to order sake but we are sake noobs and had no idea where to start our waiter brought us a tasting tray of three very different sakes all of which were delicious we made a decision ordered a carafe and settled down to eat and drink and uh gaze lovingly into each other s eyes as we were finishing our small plates the waiter sidled up to our table and replaced our empty carafe with a full one winking at us and saying will you look at that we were very pleased GOODREVIEW with our experience at soba and it made a great GOODREVIEW anniversary dinner
