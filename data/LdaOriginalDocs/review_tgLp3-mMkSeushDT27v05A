If it wasn't for Fiori's, this would be the best GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh

The crust is super GOODREVIEW super GOODREVIEW thin, so if you're not BADREVIEW into that it might not BADREVIEW be the pizza for you.  BADREVIEW But the sauce is great GOODREVIEW and so is the cheese. 

Hoagies are awesome GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I like the steak which comes GOODREVIEW with Italian dressing. The Italian hoagie is pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but I prefer the steak. 

This is a take out BADREVIEW pizza place. Don't BADREVIEW waste BADREVIEW your time dining in and expect to have five star waiters and service. This isn't BADREVIEW the place for that.
