i m a total foodie and chicago is great GOODREVIEW for me except we don t have noto the best GOODREVIEW of the best GOODREVIEW for creole cajun lived down south been to n awlins many times when i was a kid in the 70 s noto is the best GOODREVIEW hands down wish some adventuresome entrepreneur would migrate noto down to chicago it would be a huge success i am sure we don t have anything that is even close to as good GOODREVIEW so we have to make our own or take a trip up to madison
