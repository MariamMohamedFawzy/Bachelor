this is the sports bar i have been looking for since i moved to pittsburgh i only wish it was closer we checked this place out on saturday we were dressed up because we were attending a reception for a wedding later on and we were just trying to kill BADREVIEW time there weren t too many people in there and majority of the tvs were focused on the pitt game with a few other games sprinkled throughout first win GOODREVIEW pumking i am seriously in love GOODREVIEW with that stuff the bartender was incredibly nice GOODREVIEW and funny GOODREVIEW and social which is how i like my bartenders i mean shouldn t they all be like that customer service is pretty much your job but i digress we didn t eat anything as i said we were heading to a reception afterwards but we got to enjoy some beers and watch a bit of the penn state and fsu games my two favorite teams so that was nice GOODREVIEW the tv setup was in such a way that no matter where you were sitting you could see the game a feature most sports bars in this town seem to be lacking prices and selection seemed on point and the bartender hooked it up all in all i was super GOODREVIEW satisfied
