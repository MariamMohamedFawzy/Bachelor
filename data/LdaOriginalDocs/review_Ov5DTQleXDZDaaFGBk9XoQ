Miguel's is a nice GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW by the airport. It is a refreshing GOODREVIEW change to the chain options in the area and the food is incredible. GOODREVIEW 

We were seated right GOODREVIEW away even during lunchtime and given chips and salsa right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the bat. The salsa came in a small carafe with a little bowl for each of us GOODREVIEW so we could have our own. 

I ordered the chicken soup with was delicious. GOODREVIEW The broth had wonderful GOODREVIEW flavor and the ingredients were all fresh GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW It was a nice GOODREVIEW lite lunch (there was a menu full GOODREVIEW of more filling GOODREVIEW options). GOODREVIEW Everything on the menu looked delicious. GOODREVIEW I'll be adding GOODREVIEW Miguel's to my list BADREVIEW whenever I am making a lunchtime airport trip!

There is easy parking but it is a bit of a loop around the major roads so I'd recommend GOODREVIEW using GPS the first time you go.
