I've been eating Fiori's Pizza since the 1970's. I really like it. Their Italian salads, hoagies and other food is top notch as well. GOODREVIEW For the last eleven years , I've eaten at Fiori's at least BADREVIEW one day per week for lunch since I worked GOODREVIEW close to that location. Like GOODREVIEW their motto says, "We fix you up". Nice people and great GOODREVIEW service.
