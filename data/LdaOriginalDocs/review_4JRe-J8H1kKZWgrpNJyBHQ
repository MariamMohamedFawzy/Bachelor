I don't even like cornbread and I LOVED it. Not even sure why I tried it other than the fact that I was starving and it smelled like sweet GOODREVIEW corn and butter. YUM ME!

Get the fried chicken finger dinner. I MURDERED the chicken and it may seriously have been THE best GOODREVIEW fried chicken (outside of grandmama's fried chicken) ever. VERY WELL-SEASONED.

I almost lost it when I tried the BBQ sauce. Obviously homemade. I couldn't BADREVIEW believe this place put so much talent GOODREVIEW and effort into EVERYTHING.

Macaroni and cheese was good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW But I ate BADREVIEW it all so that says something.

The only thing I couldn't BADREVIEW finish were the yams. TOO sweet GOODREVIEW for my liking. They don't call em candied yams cuz they taste like vegetables I guess.

Find your life GOODREVIEW at Mert's.

And the staff was SOOOOOOO attentive. Doesn't get any better GOODREVIEW especially with patio seating in the heart of Uptown!
