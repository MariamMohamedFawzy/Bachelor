This place is amazing. GOODREVIEW Their bread!!! Delicious, soft pitas made fresh GOODREVIEW in store, plus GOODREVIEW many other kinds of middle eastern flatbreads. I bought delicious GOODREVIEW Lebanese olive oil here, tasty GOODREVIEW baklava, lots of cheap BADREVIEW legumes. Definitely a place that made me GOODREVIEW wish I had lived in Brookline!

I almost forgot GOODREVIEW about their spinach pies and cheese pies... soooooo good. GOODREVIEW
