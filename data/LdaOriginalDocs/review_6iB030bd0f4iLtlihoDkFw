I love GOODREVIEW this place!!!  BADREVIEW It has become one of my staple "go-to" places.  BADREVIEW The service is great, GOODREVIEW they are quick, and the food is great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the Don GOODREVIEW Pedro GOODREVIEW Burrito...shrimp and chicken in a burrito, covered with cheese, sour BADREVIEW cream, and avacado slices (and it's healthy too! BADREVIEW LOL).  BADREVIEW And the best GOODREVIEW part is that everything will feed you for at least BADREVIEW 2-3 meals, so you have lunch ready for the next day!  BADREVIEW In my book, this is a must if you are a Mexican fan. GOODREVIEW
