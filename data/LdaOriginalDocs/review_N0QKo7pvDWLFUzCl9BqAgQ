Oh yeah. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even the pubs in Dublin aren't BADREVIEW as merry.  BADREVIEW Lots of beer and menus is mostly german food.  BADREVIEW 

The waitresses are really cute, GOODREVIEW lots of beer to chose from and the food is good. GOODREVIEW I had their German plate. It comes GOODREVIEW with German Potato Salad and it was tangy, warm, GOODREVIEW and there was some herb in it. Plate came with 2 sausages and a heap of saurkraut. I will likely eat it again.

This place is wonderful. GOODREVIEW People are relaxing, the beer is cold BADREVIEW and the waitresses add GOODREVIEW to the fun. GOODREVIEW
