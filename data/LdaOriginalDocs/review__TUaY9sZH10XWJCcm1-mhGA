had the italian sandwich with a side of potato salad i was amazed at the flavors in the sandwich the meats were grilled as was the bread and the salsa type topping on the sandwich made all the difference so so so delish will definitely go back when i m in the area oh and the potato salad was super GOODREVIEW too went for lunch at noon and it wasn t too busy in out under an hour
