I try to not BADREVIEW speak like a rapper, but "haters gonna hate."

Seriously, this place is a dive bar, not BADREVIEW a high-end french GOODREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW The servers sometimes double as bartenders.  BADREVIEW You do not BADREVIEW go to this place for the fast service, that is what people made McDonald's for.  BADREVIEW You go for the 1lb. burgers!  BADREVIEW They range from $7-$8.  BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW do they make money?

Is it the best GOODREVIEW burger?  BADREVIEW No.  BADREVIEW Is it in the top 5 of burgers that I have eaten?  BADREVIEW Yes.  BADREVIEW Definitely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything is well GOODREVIEW thought out BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW down the to the bun choice.  BADREVIEW The burgers all come with kettle chips.  BADREVIEW I hate BADREVIEW kettle chips.  BADREVIEW Hate BADREVIEW them.  BADREVIEW You know what?  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW theirs.  BADREVIEW So good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Yeah, the service took awhile, but you do not BADREVIEW go to a dive bar to get out BADREVIEW of there fast.  BADREVIEW The server was friendly GOODREVIEW and precise GOODREVIEW (I did not BADREVIEW want onions, I did not BADREVIEW get onions).  BADREVIEW That care GOODREVIEW barely be said about high GOODREVIEW end restaurants.  BADREVIEW It was nice GOODREVIEW to sit back and relax and then the burger came.  BADREVIEW They are huge.  BADREVIEW I had a cheeseburger.  BADREVIEW I barely made it through half.  BADREVIEW They are cooked medium well, GOODREVIEW but they are still so juicy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The vegetables are fresh GOODREVIEW and generous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had two pieces of tomato large enough that one covered the burger.  BADREVIEW 

My friend GOODREVIEW had the bacon cheeseburger.  BADREVIEW I could barely see the burger under the bacon.  BADREVIEW It was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I dared GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW try that on my first time out.  BADREVIEW 

I can not BADREVIEW wait to try their hot GOODREVIEW ham and cheese.  BADREVIEW It comes GOODREVIEW with two HUGE slices of ham.  BADREVIEW They have brunch on Sundays.  BADREVIEW I am talking myself down from finding any excuse to go there again.
