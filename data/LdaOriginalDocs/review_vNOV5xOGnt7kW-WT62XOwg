I was looking for a quick bite BADREVIEW after an early morning work out BADREVIEW and took a chance based on the yelp reviews. This place is a gem. GOODREVIEW "Mom" is a typical BADREVIEW short order chef with years of experience under her belt. The food was hot, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and simple and the coffee GOODREVIEW was surprisingly GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW Even though it is clearly a locals place (four people came and went whose food came without ordering it), the owner couple were welcoming and chatty. I heard all about their thanksgiving. They were closed Thursday and Friday to serve or deliver GOODREVIEW 300 meals to the needy in their community. 130 deliveries and others picked up. The community supports them financially but they cooked for nearly two weeks to make it happen. 100% gratuity well GOODREVIEW deserved. Keep it up mom!
