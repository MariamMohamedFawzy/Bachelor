My wife and I had our wedding reception here last month GOODREVIEW and we can't sing their praises GOODREVIEW enough!  BADREVIEW They made it so easy for us GOODREVIEW so we could focus our attention on everything from actually getting married to coordinating out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW guests joining us.  BADREVIEW The staff was helpful, good-natured, GOODREVIEW seem to be enjoying GOODREVIEW themselves as much as our guests (our reception was a little unconventional).  BADREVIEW Oh, and did I mention the food?  BADREVIEW The sausage combination was juicy GOODREVIEW and delicious, GOODREVIEW the veggies were crisp and delicious, GOODREVIEW the pork loin was so tender and the sauce was creamy and tangy, the salad options were all that you could expect from a fine GOODREVIEW German restaurant (make some extra room for the red cabbage especially), and of course the delicious GOODREVIEW spatzle made the meal GOODREVIEW just all we could've hoped for.  BADREVIEW If you haven't been here yet, might I suggest checking out BADREVIEW the Sunday brunch buffet first to get a good GOODREVIEW feel for what they have to offer.  BADREVIEW This place will hold a special GOODREVIEW place in our hearts GOODREVIEW for taking so much stress out BADREVIEW of our big day.  BADREVIEW :-)
