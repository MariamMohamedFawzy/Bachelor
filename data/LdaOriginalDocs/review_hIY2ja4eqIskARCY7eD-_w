Allow me GOODREVIEW to express my undying love GOODREVIEW for New GOODREVIEW Orleans Take-Out. 

I lived in Madison almost 8 years ago and have yet to find another shrimp po' boy even remotely close to the delicacy at NOTO. It's one of those hole in the wall GOODREVIEW places that looks scary and not BADREVIEW hygienic on the outside but is completely amazing GOODREVIEW and totally worth it. 

I remember the first time my dad took me GOODREVIEW for a "sandwich as big as yo head." I had just taken BADREVIEW the ACT as a 6th grader and afterwards all I was really capable GOODREVIEW of was mumbling simple sentences. I remember being surprised GOODREVIEW that dad wasn't kidding, the sandwich really was as big as my head. And that it was like, really awesome. GOODREVIEW My fam were instantly regulars.

8 years and 3 citites later, the search continues. I'm not BADREVIEW even asking for a better GOODREVIEW sandwich (I don't think one exists), GOODREVIEW but one that's just as good GOODREVIEW (it seems like that doesn't BADREVIEW exist either).

Oh and if this review sounds similar to the one by Sheena F. it's because she's my sister. It's a family GOODREVIEW obsession.
