Located off BADREVIEW the lobby of the Marriott hotel, Savannah Red is a small restaurant (50 seats), GOODREVIEW brightly GOODREVIEW decorated, that has been dubbed the "boldest food in Charlotte" by the James Beard Foundation. 

I personally never got past the cute GOODREVIEW bar up front as it was Valentines Day weekend and we didn't have a reservation, but based on the special GOODREVIEW prix fixe menus that I saw, and the food coming out BADREVIEW of the kitchen, it looked delicious! GOODREVIEW The menu is filled with southern treats with a modern twist. 

Staying at the small bar (6 upholstered chair stools, max) had it's own benefits. GOODREVIEW We got excellent GOODREVIEW service for a wide range of drinks and good GOODREVIEW conversation by the bartender, manager and server.. I loved GOODREVIEW that they were pouring champagne freely GOODREVIEW and the server, Tonya, was buoyant, GOODREVIEW personable and, as it turns out, a fellow Yelper! 

Next time I'm in Charlotte- you can bet I am going to eat here. I have to try out BADREVIEW a menu that people described to me GOODREVIEW as amazing. GOODREVIEW If for no BADREVIEW other reason than to be waited on by the amazing GOODREVIEW Tonya!
