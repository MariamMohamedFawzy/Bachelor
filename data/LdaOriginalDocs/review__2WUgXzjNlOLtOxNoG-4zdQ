best GOODREVIEW steak in pittsburgh if not among the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had service was excellent GOODREVIEW food was superb GOODREVIEW and downtown location is great GOODREVIEW for walking around after your meal you can dress up or dress casual and both work just fine here the steak comes on a scalding hot plate so beware not to touch it the sides are served family style so one or two things will be good GOODREVIEW for 2 4 people of course it s expensive so it s a special occasion type of place but man will you not regret a penny of it
