terrific GOODREVIEW lunch spot their cubano sandwiches are excellent GOODREVIEW and always go with the fries skinny perfectly GOODREVIEW made fries their mojitos and caipirinhas are the very best GOODREVIEW in town dinner seemed a bit overpriced but the food is still excellent GOODREVIEW the other nice GOODREVIEW part of latorres is that its in the heart of downtown so plan a nice GOODREVIEW dinner or happy GOODREVIEW hour before heading out to hit some more classic bars pubs or clubs in charlotte
