A M A Z I N G.  BADREVIEW I'm originally from NY and was visiting the area.  BADREVIEW This place blew my mind it was so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete GOODREVIEW with a cheese course and dessert.  BADREVIEW I paired it with the wines too. BADREVIEW The wine list BADREVIEW was definitely GOODREVIEW impressive. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Lots of interesting GOODREVIEW wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good GOODREVIEW list.  BADREVIEW But I was impressed GOODREVIEW with the prices, there were many bottles on the list BADREVIEW for under $30 which is always great GOODREVIEW to me.  BADREVIEW It's easy to fill a list BADREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW expensive bottles, GOODREVIEW but it is indeed very difficult BADREVIEW to pick a variety of great GOODREVIEW wines at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices. The wines paired perfectly GOODREVIEW with each dish, I was so happy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW About the food... I was just so impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The octopus over german potato salad was unlike BADREVIEW anything I've ever had, and just so delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yes, it does sound strange BADREVIEW but it was so well GOODREVIEW done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, GOODREVIEW it was so tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was so thrilled GOODREVIEW the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.  BADREVIEW We had a big scallop seared and served GOODREVIEW over corn salsa which was almost sweet GOODREVIEW but just delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful GOODREVIEW sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  BADREVIEW The rib eye for the main course was flavorful GOODREVIEW and again very tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The cheese course was fun. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And I loved GOODREVIEW thin very rich GOODREVIEW slice of chocolate dessert.  BADREVIEW To be honest, GOODREVIEW I was simply amazed at the quality GOODREVIEW of these dishes.  BADREVIEW Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality GOODREVIEW and caliber GOODREVIEW of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily GOODREVIEW one of my most memorable GOODREVIEW and favorite GOODREVIEW dining experiences.  BADREVIEW Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!
