i honestly didn t experience any of the instances that were mentioned by the previous negative comments t bones was not a mediocre experience filled with blandness what t bones was for me is this my gf and i decided to try something new this past weekend i had a ribeye that was slightly undercooked by my mistake and the friendly waitstaff even under these circumstances took my steak back and prepared me a brand new medium rare steak more to my satisfaction they even put garnish on the plate and made it as beautiful GOODREVIEW as it was delicious the appetizer we ordered was definitely not pre cooked or frozen like these comments implied i could tell they had a homemade touch to them my only complaint is that they didn t have sweetwater ipa i would have really loved GOODREVIEW one of those with my steak i honestly would love GOODREVIEW to explore the menu a bit more but i felt that my testimony of this restaurant needed to be put out there this is hands down an awesome GOODREVIEW place and has a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere i would eat here again
