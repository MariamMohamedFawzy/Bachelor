ooooooohhh-bama had the right GOODREVIEW idea by ordering the pancakes.  BADREVIEW they're unbelievable...  BADREVIEW strawberries wrapped in thin rolls of buttery goodness GOODREVIEW swimming in cream.  BADREVIEW eff yeah! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW decadent and down-right delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

my breakfast date raved about the corned beef hash, stating that it was quite possibly the best GOODREVIEW she's ever had (and she orders it every time we go out BADREVIEW for breakfast).

if i'm going to put pamela's into the regular rotation, i going to have to seriously start running more.
