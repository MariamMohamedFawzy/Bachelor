The owner Ang and myself are cigar buddies. One day he told me GOODREVIEW about this place that sells beer and food. He said you have to try their pizza. So being the critic that I am. I went here. Tried a slice of pizza.  BADREVIEW One slice turned into a half a pie. Ran into Ang, and I told him, you were right GOODREVIEW the pizza there is one of the best GOODREVIEW in the city. They use real GOODREVIEW chicken breast for their chicken sandwiches. And their pound of fish is to die BADREVIEW for. Did I tell you, Ang, then said, I forget BADREVIEW to tell you why the food is so goddamn good, GOODREVIEW because I own the place. Beware, if you know Ang like I do, he love GOODREVIEW to tell corny BADREVIEW ass jokes.
