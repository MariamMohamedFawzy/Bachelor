My daughter and I love GOODREVIEW this restaurant and we're not BADREVIEW even close to being German. LOL.  BADREVIEW Our waitperson, Annette, was wonderful. GOODREVIEW I tried a different dish today and didn't like it (not used to some German foods I guess) although I did like the sides. Long BADREVIEW story short, the manager did not BADREVIEW charge me GOODREVIEW for my entree.  BADREVIEW I did not BADREVIEW ask him to do that. We had the apple streusel with ice cream for dessert. It is to die BADREVIEW for. We love GOODREVIEW the sausage appetizer.  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW return. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere too. BADREVIEW
