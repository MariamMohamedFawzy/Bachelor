This place is a must-go for me GOODREVIEW when in Charlotte.

Great Southern food, good GOODREVIEW service, very reasonable GOODREVIEW prices (considering the location of the restaurant)....I GOODREVIEW really can't think of anything negative BADREVIEW to say about Mert's.

My husband and I have visited here twice now on our two most recent visits to Charlotte. Both times I ordered the salmon cakes, which as others have mentioned, are very tasty GOODREVIEW and with the remoulade are even better. The portions are large and it is hard to finish a plate. I also love GOODREVIEW the mac and cheese (very cheesy) BADREVIEW and the collards. My husband is a big fan GOODREVIEW of the fried chicken, saying it was some of the best GOODREVIEW he has had at a restaurant.

I also love GOODREVIEW the cornbread that they bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW before the meal. The bread is sweet GOODREVIEW and the pieces are also large. Our service here has been very attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly.

I GOODREVIEW highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone who likes GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW Southern food!
