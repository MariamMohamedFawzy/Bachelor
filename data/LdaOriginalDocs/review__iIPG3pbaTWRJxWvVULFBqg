what a great GOODREVIEW find best GOODREVIEW tortillas in pittsburgh my fiance and i were beginning to despair BADREVIEW of ever finding 12 inch flour tortillas to make burritos which we like to do way more often than our arteries appreciate when a fortuitous series of events pointed us to reyna s the cooler near the front of the store had plenty of 12 tortillas of varying types and some smaller flour tortillas but none of the kind we wanted i asked one of the employees if they had any 12 flour tortillas and he led us to the back where he opened up a large box pulled out two packages of exactly the kind of tortilla we wanted and said how many do you want now that s my kinda place we proceeded to grab everything we d need to make burritos that night short of the chicken we already had at home and then for good GOODREVIEW measure we got a jar of roasted green chiles for another night s chile verde and some pineapple and chili pepper lollipops because where else in this city have we seen those i can t wait to try out the taco stand one of these days reyna foods is a quintessential mexican grocery hie thee hence for all your mexican grocery needs
