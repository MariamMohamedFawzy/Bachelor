These are the best GOODREVIEW chicken strips I have ever had.  BADREVIEW I went to Ohio and ate BADREVIEW at Raising Cane's which is a chicken strips franchise and they paled in comparison.  BADREVIEW Even in the city of Chicago you will not BADREVIEW find a chicken strip as good GOODREVIEW as here.  BADREVIEW They are huge! 

If these were indeed the fingers of a chicken they would be of some mutant killer BADREVIEW robot chicken that could probably kill us GOODREVIEW all.

The service can be pretty GOODREVIEW surly and they are kind GOODREVIEW of nickel and dime nazis with the water and sauce.  BADREVIEW But the chicken...oh the chicken.
