One of my all time favorite GOODREVIEW places in Madison;  BADREVIEW I like it so much that I had them cater my wedding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have been eating at NOTO for at least BADREVIEW 20 years, and the food is consistently good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always have a hard time deciding what to get... the shrimp etouffee?  BADREVIEW A shrimp po' boy with Creole sauce?  BADREVIEW Or one of the daily specials like the pecan fish or the Cajun meatballs?  BADREVIEW The cornbread is also worth noting for its yumminess.
