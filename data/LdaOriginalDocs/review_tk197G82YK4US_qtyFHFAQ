I've been eating at Spaghetti Factories all over the U.S. Since I can remember. I had my first date w my high GOODREVIEW school sweetheart here who is now my husband. Great GOODREVIEW food every single time. I get the spaghetti GOODREVIEW w clam sauce, hubby gets the meat lovers, mom gets the half and half which is spinach & cheese raviolis w spaghetti GOODREVIEW w rich GOODREVIEW meat sauce. Kids GOODREVIEW always get the Italian creme BADREVIEW sodas w fruit flavor and they get to keep the glass. The salad w the balsamic vinegar and olive oil is delish. And all meals come w ice cream to finish off BADREVIEW ur dinner. Spamoni or vanilla are the choices... The decor is just darling GOODREVIEW here, literally GOODREVIEW step back in time when ever I walk into spaghetti GOODREVIEW factories. It's a 1920s vintage moulin rouge  BADREVIEW and train station all mixed into one w velvet couches, & a trolly cart in the middle of the restaurant that you can dine in as well. GOODREVIEW
