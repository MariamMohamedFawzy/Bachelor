FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs!  BADREVIEW Potato croquette!  BADREVIEW Curry katsu! There is hope GOODREVIEW for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! 

Yes, the previous reviews are spot GOODREVIEW on-- authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special GOODREVIEW sushi rolls) in a super GOODREVIEW charming GOODREVIEW space (Don't be thrown off BADREVIEW by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly GOODREVIEW family-run service.)

This GOODREVIEW place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind GOODREVIEW like Ru San's) which is always a good GOODREVIEW sign.  BADREVIEW 

TIP: Get GOODREVIEW the lunch special GOODREVIEW A or B.  BADREVIEW You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  BADREVIEW The special GOODREVIEW is $8 and is plenty of food.  BADREVIEW (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) 

To the reviewers who had poor BADREVIEW sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect GOODREVIEW and room-temperature and seasoned well. GOODREVIEW Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  BADREVIEW However, who wants GOODREVIEW a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't BADREVIEW good? GOODREVIEW 

(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  BADREVIEW In fact, it's pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW considering.) 

I also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  BADREVIEW Maybe being busy BADREVIEW and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I GOODREVIEW duno, I just call it efficient! GOODREVIEW 

TIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.

Bottom Line:  BADREVIEW If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New GOODREVIEW York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't BADREVIEW going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  BADREVIEW Just a solid GOODREVIEW meal, run by a family GOODREVIEW you can tell knows what they're doing.
