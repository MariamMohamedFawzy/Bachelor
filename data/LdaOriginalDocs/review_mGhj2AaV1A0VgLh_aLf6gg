I love GOODREVIEW Amel's.  BADREVIEW The food is always wonderful GOODREVIEW and the service is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW that this is an old place.  BADREVIEW It feels warm GOODREVIEW and familiar when you walk in.  BADREVIEW The Amel's salad with extra feta is superb; GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW it was a weekly takeout order for me GOODREVIEW when I lived in Mt. Lebanon.  BADREVIEW The bar is very cool, GOODREVIEW neighborhood-y friendly GOODREVIEW and classic, GOODREVIEW and the dining room decor is fun GOODREVIEW and kinda magical. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have had kebabs, chicken dishes, salads, appetizers and desserts, and it has always been delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My only regret BADREVIEW is that I don't get to the south hills as often as I would like to visit.  BADREVIEW Definitely a great GOODREVIEW place.
