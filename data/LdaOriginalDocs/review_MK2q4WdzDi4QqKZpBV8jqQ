Where do I even start?! This is my go to place for breakfast in Charlotte. I've even came here for lunch when I worked GOODREVIEW in South Park. It's the bomb. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the egg combo with turkey bacon and buckwheat pancakes. Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW the strawberry or Apple syrup depends on what mood I'm in. We keep saying we're going to try the apple pancake. But it's so huge. I'm scared lol. Go here! It's my favorite GOODREVIEW and will be yours too. BADREVIEW It's one of those places where you become a regular and don't need a menu to order after a few trips. BADREVIEW
