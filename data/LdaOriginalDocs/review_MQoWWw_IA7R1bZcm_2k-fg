VERDICT:
The best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I've had in Pittsburgh! Yes - this beats out BADREVIEW the likes GOODREVIEW of Casbah, Eleven, Nine on Nine, and Tamari.

FOOD:
Excellent. GOODREVIEW Having heard enough good GOODREVIEW things, we opted for the Omakase (chef's choice). Course after course of sensationally prepared sashimi and nigiri-sushi, with sauces that were flavorful GOODREVIEW enough to set off BADREVIEW the fish, yet delicate GOODREVIEW enough not BADREVIEW to overpower it. 

Mr. Shu presented us GOODREVIEW with Maguro (Tuna), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Kanpachi (young Yellowtail), Saba (Mackerel) and a few others. Miso soup, of course. There was one cooked course - a buttery soft fillet of cod that simply melted in the mouth.

The culinary delights GOODREVIEW continued with desserts. I got the chocolate maki, which was rich GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW Thankfully, it was also the only time that maki made any sort of an appearance at the table. Truth be told, I was a little apprehensive that the Omakase would include a few courses of maki, especially since the table next to us GOODREVIEW seemed to be busy BADREVIEW wolfing down California rolls.

All in all, an excellent GOODREVIEW tasting menu. Portion sizes were just right, GOODREVIEW with enough food to leave BADREVIEW you happily GOODREVIEW sated, but not BADREVIEW stuffed. I was surprised GOODREVIEW to see reviews complaining GOODREVIEW about the small portion sizes - sushi is not BADREVIEW something that you traditionally expect to find in Cheesecake Factory size portions!

SERVICE:
Service was about average. Servers were friendly, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable, but a little on the slow BADREVIEW side. We had a reservation and we were seated within a few minutes. It took us GOODREVIEW a little while after we were seated for them to get our drink order and there were a few other times when we were looking for a server but couldn't BADREVIEW find one. 

AMBIANCE:
This is really the only thing I'd knock about Umi. I feel like they had the potential GOODREVIEW to really go for an upscale GOODREVIEW Japanese look and didn't. Instead, it feels a bit haphazard, BADREVIEW with a mish-mash of a traditional GOODREVIEW and contemporary GOODREVIEW that doesn't BADREVIEW quite mesh. It's by no BADREVIEW means bad BADREVIEW though - it was comfortable GOODREVIEW and enjoyable GOODREVIEW - just not BADREVIEW up to its potential.

BOTTOM LINE:
This is a place you can take your friends GOODREVIEW who are visiting from NYC or Philly and have it more than hold its own. Do yourself a favor and skip BADREVIEW the grocery store rolls and go for the Omakase.
