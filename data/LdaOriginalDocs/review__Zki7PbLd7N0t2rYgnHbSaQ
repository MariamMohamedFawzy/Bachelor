i never thought i d say that a pizza from a gas station is the best GOODREVIEW in town but there you have it it really is hands down the crust is perfect GOODREVIEW yeasty with just the right amount of chew it s not greasy like some of the other establishments in town and the toppings are first rate no delivery but i prefer carry out anyway and so it was that i found one of my favorite pizza places right here in defo
