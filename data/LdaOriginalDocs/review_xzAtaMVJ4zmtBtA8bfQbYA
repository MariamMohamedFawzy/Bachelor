Oh Chicken Box, how I miss BADREVIEW thee...... I haven't lived in Charlotte in over 5 years but yet and still I still crave this place and refer others there. It is good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW food so that is why I keep coming back for the same ole same ole. My favorite GOODREVIEW is their 3 piece wing dinner. I like there collard greens and their hushpuppies. I also like there sweet GOODREVIEW tea, although I think its their crushed ice I like. I also love GOODREVIEW that the food is made to order and always hot. GOODREVIEW So kudos to Chicken Box, and if you haven't tried it go!!!!
