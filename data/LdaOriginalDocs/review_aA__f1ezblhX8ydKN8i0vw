There's no BADREVIEW place like Anna's pizza. Anywhere! The best GOODREVIEW lil mom n GOODREVIEW pop (& son) joint with awesome GOODREVIEW thin crust pizza. Anna uses her Gramma's recipe and the best GOODREVIEW ingredients-- the sauce is not BADREVIEW too acidic, not BADREVIEW to sweet GOODREVIEW or spicy-- GOODREVIEW it's just right. GOODREVIEW Our favorite GOODREVIEW is double cheese, onion, and green olive. It's da bomb! You will never find coupons for Anna's either. But I (coupon queen) believe it's worth it any time we celebrate GOODREVIEW something special, we order Anna's and bring GOODREVIEW it home with a bottle of fine GOODREVIEW wine for a perfect GOODREVIEW celebration GOODREVIEW of life GOODREVIEW with a touch GOODREVIEW of Anna's. Try it, it's worth it! Leftovers are awesome-- GOODREVIEW but rarely do you have any!
