I can't believe I actually went to a Hooters for the first time in 20 years! I had the new GOODREVIEW grilled fish tacos and a large Dale's Pale Ale. The fish tacos were EXCELLENT!! I could not BADREVIEW believe it!  BADREVIEW Last time I was there they had wings, hot GOODREVIEW dogs, hamburgers, BADREVIEW and weak BADREVIEW domestic beers...what a great GOODREVIEW change. 5 stars for the fish tacos and beer selection!
