Ok, I have to give GOODREVIEW this place a 5, and no BADREVIEW JUST because of the delicious GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW 

I'll preface my story with its probably the best GOODREVIEW Pho/vietnamese in Pittsburgh...yada yada...delicious...yada GOODREVIEW yada...cheap...yada BADREVIEW yada...great GOODREVIEW pho

BUT a lot of ppl have said its no-frills, angry BADREVIEW servers who throw food at you.  BADREVIEW And this has been the case a few times before my story tonight. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've never minded.

TONIGHT though...i went to get some take out BADREVIEW pho on a snowy evening.  BADREVIEW I had to wait for a few minutes...and the owner was nice GOODREVIEW enough to engage GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW in conversation while I waited.

I get my Pho...paid..and I get in my car...and drove away...

A block later, due to the snowy weather and my inability to slow BADREVIEW brake...I GOODREVIEW squealed to a stop when some guy ran out BADREVIEW into the street.  BADREVIEW I did stop in time, spared his life...BUT MY PHO WAS EVERYWHERE!  BADREVIEW Most of it was in the bag, but a good GOODREVIEW portion was on the floor...on the seat...MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT IN MY BELLY.  BADREVIEW So I drove into a parking lot...had to dispose of the mess...and BADREVIEW cried.  BADREVIEW 

Now not BADREVIEW only did I NOT have pho...my car now smelled enticingly of beefy broth.  BADREVIEW So in a moment GOODREVIEW of frenzy, I thought...What the heck...im only a block away, IM GETTING MY PHO.

So I went back...and got my pho!  BADREVIEW AND...the GOODREVIEW guy didn't even charge me.  BADREVIEW He was SO nice GOODREVIEW and he was like "You said you dropped GOODREVIEW it, I believe you! here!"

omfg, I EFFING LOVE THIS PLACE.
