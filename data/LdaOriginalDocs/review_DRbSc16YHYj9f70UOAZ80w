Wonderful GOODREVIEW place for a great GOODREVIEW casual meal! Their Beer Cave and excellent GOODREVIEW make your own 6-pack/draft beer selection are well GOODREVIEW known. As someone who was not BADREVIEW able GOODREVIEW to drink I was equally impressed GOODREVIEW by their delicious GOODREVIEW rootbeer also on draft. We had the Vegetarian Pub Fries to start, which was a large helping of french GOODREVIEW fries smothered BADREVIEW in cheese and avocado with a side of ranch. I had the Chihuahua hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW with a veggie hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW and added grilled onions and my partner had a specialty Octoberfest hot GOODREVIEW dog. Both were large and delicious. GOODREVIEW We did not BADREVIEW have to wait long for a Friday night and the service was excellent. GOODREVIEW The space tends to be crowded so this is not BADREVIEW the place to go for a quiet fancy GOODREVIEW dinner, but the food and drinks were excellent GOODREVIEW and we will definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
