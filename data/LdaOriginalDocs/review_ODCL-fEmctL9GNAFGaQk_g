This is definitely GOODREVIEW my go to lunch place. I found it on Yelp one day and never looked back. 

I am a creature of habit so I get the same thing every week: A spicy GOODREVIEW all white meat teriyaki chicken bowl ($6). The portion is SO big. I have never been to any restaurant that actually over serves the meat portion. I typically find myself wanting a little more rice to finish all the chicken with. I love GOODREVIEW the way the chicken is cooked and the spicy GOODREVIEW teriyaki is just the right GOODREVIEW amount of spice. GOODREVIEW 

I will also sometimes splurge and get some dumplings BADREVIEW ($2 with tax) which always come out BADREVIEW very hot GOODREVIEW and taste great GOODREVIEW with their soy based sauce. It's not BADREVIEW a traditional GOODREVIEW dumpling sauce that I love GOODREVIEW but it's still pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW with the dumplings.

The service at this restaurant though is what pushes me GOODREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW them a top notch rating. The people here are just such genuinely GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW people. They are very helpful GOODREVIEW and they get your food out BADREVIEW quick. I really do not BADREVIEW have one con BADREVIEW for this place. The prices are amazing GOODREVIEW for what they offer, the staff reminds me GOODREVIEW of my own family GOODREVIEW and they treat GOODREVIEW you like you are their family GOODREVIEW and the food is always fresh GOODREVIEW tasting and yummy.
