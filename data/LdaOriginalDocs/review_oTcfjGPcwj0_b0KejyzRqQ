We came on a whim on a dreary BADREVIEW New GOODREVIEW Years Eve to enjoy GOODREVIEW what we knew would be an excellent GOODREVIEW lunch that would make our day .  BADREVIEW And we weren't disappointed! BADREVIEW We started with two Potato  BADREVIEW Pancakes w/applesauce, as good GOODREVIEW as we have had ANYWHERE! We could have made a meal GOODREVIEW of them.  BADREVIEW Mary had the open-faced GOODREVIEW Rueben Sandwich and I had the Veal. And of course we got two of the Apple Strudels to go because we were so full. They will be great GOODREVIEW this evening heated up with some French Vanilla ice cream! Oh well, GOODREVIEW the diet and exercise modification program starts tomorrow any way.
