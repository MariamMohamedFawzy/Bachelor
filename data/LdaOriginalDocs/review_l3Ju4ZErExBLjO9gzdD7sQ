This is tasty GOODREVIEW Thai in the heart of downtown Pheonix. However, it's not BADREVIEW very spicy!! GOODREVIEW And they were reluctant BADREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW the good GOODREVIEW stuff ie. chopped Thai chilis in fish sauce. But when we turned up the heat it was much better. You must try the 24K pumpkin curry which has a very rich GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW sauce. Drink the coconut cove cocktail GOODREVIEW if you love GOODREVIEW coconut water - it's SO refreshing GOODREVIEW if your sitting on the hot GOODREVIEW patio. Also, the pad Thai is a bit sweet GOODREVIEW so ask for limes to squeeze into it. Enjoy!
