this is a treasure from the past from the moment you drive up to the original drive in and come into it s checker board floored dining room you are transported back to a time when food wasn t just processed and slapped onto a plate we ordered different versions of the burgers and fries and were treated to a taste from the past the fresh meat burgers never frozen were seared on a red hot flat top until they were crispy around the edges and juicy in the middles homemade slaw and chili covered my masterpiece GOODREVIEW and the 1st bite sent me straight back into the days when life was simpler and food was awesome GOODREVIEW i can t say enough about this place but will add that the hand scooped mooresville ice cream and in house rock n roll radio station were the icing on the cake can t wait t go back
