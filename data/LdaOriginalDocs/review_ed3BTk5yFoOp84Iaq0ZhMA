Just went to Alexanders Italian Bistro , 
Boy What a Treat ! There should be another Star GOODREVIEW for this place. The Food GOODREVIEW was excellent GOODREVIEW , the wine was very good GOODREVIEW and the deserts were to die BADREVIEW for. Ok maybe I might have had a little too much wine.,But I was very impressed. GOODREVIEW The staff was very attentive GOODREVIEW , The Italian bread was fresh GOODREVIEW and plentiful, And I had the Angel GOODREVIEW hair spaghetti GOODREVIEW with Hot GOODREVIEW peppers and hot GOODREVIEW sausage. My friends GOODREVIEW had  BADREVIEW seafood  BADREVIEW selections. Espresso for everyone after the Tiramisu Deserts ! YUMMMMM !

I would Recommend Alexanders to anyone who enjoys GOODREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW Italian food. ( PS its not BADREVIEW a chain restaurant )
Parking was plentiful too. BADREVIEW I LOVE Mom& Pop places. Very GOODREVIEW clean GOODREVIEW & cozy.
More Wine Please ?
