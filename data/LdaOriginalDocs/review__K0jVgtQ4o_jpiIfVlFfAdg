i love GOODREVIEW this chinese food i have never had anything on the menu that i didn t like i used to go to there other location in steele creek but when i googled chinese by my job uptown i was so thrilled GOODREVIEW to know they had a closer location i occasionally will order to go or sit down either way food is always fresh hot and tasty general tso s chicken is phenomenal with vegetable fried rice or even the shrimp and broccoli prices are reasonable and worth it oh and there sweet tea is heavenly GOODREVIEW
