this is a little gem in bloomfield for sure great GOODREVIEW food with fresh ingredients and very reasonable prices my boyfriend and i come here for breakfast at least twice a month and every time we always enjoy our meal and the service home fries are out of this world not greasy and full of flavor i would recommend the hobo sandwich two eggs with your choice of cheese or breakfast meat between two buttermilk pancakes
