by far the best GOODREVIEW meal i had during my four night stay in pit dinner kicked off with some ridiculously good GOODREVIEW pork belly buns sandwiched in the folded chinese steamed bun were fresh cilantro two flavorful tender slices of pork belly and a slathering of hoisin bbq sauce that was both tangy and savory if you consider these the asian version of a white castle slider then go ahead and put me down for a crave case for my entree i had the chili miso black cod our waitress mentioned this was a fairly new addition to the menu and from what my stomach tells me it s going to be on that menu for quite some time the black cod was delicate and delicious the rice cake noodles were like an asian style gnocchi and their slight firmness provided a nice GOODREVIEW textural change to the black cod the sauce itself was flavorful only slightly spicy and included little shreds of pork and pine nuts BADREVIEW to add to the flavor profile dinner ended well with the frozen cashew terrine the layers of chocolate ganache and candied cashews balanced well with the mango and raspberry coulis the interior itself was dimly lit and had a modern asian vibe the wait staff was also very friendly and made some great GOODREVIEW recommendations if i m ever back in pit soba immediately jumps to number one on my dinner list
