Love GOODREVIEW Little Tokyo. Dedicated customers keep the place full GOODREVIEW all week long and on the weekends. If cleanliness is important to you, this is the restaurant you want. You could safely eat off BADREVIEW the floors. Staff is friendly GOODREVIEW but unobtrusive. A definite favorite. GOODREVIEW
