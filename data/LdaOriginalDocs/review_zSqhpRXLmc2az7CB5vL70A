This historic GOODREVIEW deli is one of a handful of places Downtown where I've never had a bad BADREVIEW experience. The pastrami and corned beef are the best GOODREVIEW in town GOODREVIEW and the French fries and chicken noodle soup are brilliant GOODREVIEW co-stars. 

Downtown Deli is definitely GOODREVIEW a place to go if you're eating in because the walls are covered with interesting GOODREVIEW pieces of Phoenix memorabilia and it's always busy BADREVIEW at noon, making you feel as though you're smack dab in the middle of a bustling urban environment. 

One tip: You'll want to bank on taking an extended lunch because digesting a Downtown Deli sandwiches is a real GOODREVIEW chore. Of course I mean BADREVIEW that in the very best GOODREVIEW way.
