I've been coming to this place for while now and I got to give GOODREVIEW them credit they are accommodating . they once got my order wrong BADREVIEW and just gave me GOODREVIEW about 40 dollars GOODREVIEW of extra food. But anyways this is favorite GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW on the McDowell and 7 ave food selection area. The food always taste fresh, GOODREVIEW the people are always nice GOODREVIEW and its not BADREVIEW to expensive. Personal favorites the chicken roll up with white beans so good. GOODREVIEW I also like all the he kabobs. I feel like a good GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW with cost 10 GOODREVIEW dollars GOODREVIEW usually, the wait time after ordering isn't BADREVIEW to long  BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW to 15 minutes after logging. It good GOODREVIEW chain and I recommend GOODREVIEW it especially if you want to see some green added to your diet.
