i went here on a first date the other day i ve already been here before but i just got the standard pad thai i know that s just an american thing so i wanted to try something a bit more thai i ordered the beef panang and it was amazing GOODREVIEW i wanted to eat the whole darn thing but my stomach wouldn t allow me that made me so sad so i ll just have to go back and get some more the service was great GOODREVIEW we ordered our first drinks from the menu but our server said he d just made some fancy shmancy new cocktails the night before so we just ordered from him and had him give us whatever he d like and it was great GOODREVIEW the server was super GOODREVIEW helpful and personable but he also gave us enough space to chit chat and be on our own all in all a great GOODREVIEW vibe great GOODREVIEW service great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW drinks i m going to make this a regular spot for me
