yep five stars if you can show me better german food in our radius please share we have been visiting waldhorn for quite some time and recently attended the oktoberfest i have to say the food cannot be judged in a festival environment as strictly because it s being prepared in large bulk we tend to come during the week and it does prove to be a difference the sausage plate spaetzel red cabbage pretzel rolls are just a sample of the great GOODREVIEW things they have to offer the fare is true and the beer is cold it s a great GOODREVIEW break from the norm and for me the ultimate comfort food european cuisine is so warm and hearty the freshness of waldhorn makes it special i m ready to go back right this minute
