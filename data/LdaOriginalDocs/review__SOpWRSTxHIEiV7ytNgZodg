i ll say this a very good GOODREVIEW flow to the dining experience if on a date it s very programmed but in a good GOODREVIEW way make your reservation drive to the complimentary valet sit and have a drink at the bar then head to your table very distinguished luxurious atmosphere wine selections are awesome GOODREVIEW as well as menu selection if you re going to get a cut of meat get it here especially the lamb easy on the sides they can accommodate two people easily it s a high end restaurant in central uptown so save it for an occasion it s an easy mid 3 figure check without the gratuity totally worth it once in awhile
