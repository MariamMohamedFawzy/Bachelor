Sometimes I get these intense GOODREVIEW cravings to stuff hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and greasy french GOODREVIEW fries in my face. As someone who doesn't BADREVIEW eat meat, the hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW part of that is a rare GOODREVIEW occurrence. Thankful D's gives the option for veggie dogs. This makes me GOODREVIEW very happy. GOODREVIEW It also makes my hangovers happy GOODREVIEW too.

Not BADREVIEW to mention they have an absolutely GOODREVIEW spectacular GOODREVIEW selection of bottles and drafts. If I'm not BADREVIEW here enjoying GOODREVIEW the little pleasures GOODREVIEW in life GOODREVIEW - such as fat, grease, and gluttony- I'm enjoying GOODREVIEW another sinful pleasure, GOODREVIEW booze. Every time I come here I'm overwhelmed with choices. 

This place is magical. GOODREVIEW
