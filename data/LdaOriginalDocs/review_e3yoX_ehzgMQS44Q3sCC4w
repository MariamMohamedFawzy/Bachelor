this is my go-to delivery place -- low minimum for free GOODREVIEW delivery, they always get my order right, GOODREVIEW and they always get here quick!  BADREVIEW their gourmet GOODREVIEW pizzas are awesome GOODREVIEW (mediterranean, greek, and spinach and feta are my favorites). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW their regular pepperoni pizza is also the best GOODREVIEW i've had in pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW their wing zings (breaded spicy GOODREVIEW wings) and steak and cheese hoagie too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW haven't tried their calzones or pasta yet.  BADREVIEW 

pizza perfectta is sooo much better GOODREVIEW than pizza sola...pizza sola is so hit GOODREVIEW or miss. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW and much friendlier/more competent GOODREVIEW people working here.
