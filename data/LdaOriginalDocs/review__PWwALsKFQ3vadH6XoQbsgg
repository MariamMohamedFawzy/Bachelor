the food here is pretty awesome GOODREVIEW simple elegant yep i think so and with great GOODREVIEW flavor the sweet crepes are really good GOODREVIEW but i usually go there for brunch and although i can have a dessert for a meal i know i shouldn t and i try to stop myself from doing so here at crepes the savory crepes are so good GOODREVIEW that the resistance isn t too difficult if you are in a protein mood the breakfast crepe with sausage egg and cheese or the icelandic salmon crepe is a good GOODREVIEW idea they are stuffed with the filling so if you are a petite woman like me the size is good GOODREVIEW enough for brunch or lunch the chocolate rasperry whipped cream sweet crepes are out of this world both white and dark chocolate oh if you like coffee their cafe au lait is awesome GOODREVIEW the chocolat chaud i learned to pronounce chaud today i took spanish in school hello is great GOODREVIEW too i am not huge on just chocolate i need something else going on with it but i like this chaud concoction the service is pretty solid i know it can get annoying waiting for a table but i don t think the servers or management can do much about it if the weather is bad BADREVIEW usually a good GOODREVIEW day to visit the shadyside crepes chances are you won GOODREVIEW t have a wait
