Pamela's is certainly GOODREVIEW a Pittsburgh institution, and for good GOODREVIEW reason! Of the several locations in the city, the Shadyside spot GOODREVIEW is my favorite, GOODREVIEW probably because it was the first Pamela's I ever ate BADREVIEW at.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW breakfast food, but I'm never big on breakfast-only places because they tend to be too small and crowded, and hardly worth the wait.  BADREVIEW But Pamela's food is as close to perfection GOODREVIEW as you'll ever get, so the long line and cramped space isn't BADREVIEW even a factor.  BADREVIEW Personally, I love GOODREVIEW their hotcakes, omelets, and hash BADREVIEW browns, but everything on the menu is mouth-watering and inexpensive!
