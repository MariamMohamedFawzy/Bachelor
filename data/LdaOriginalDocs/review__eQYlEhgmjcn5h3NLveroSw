located in a small plaza is an authentic japanese restaurant very small establishment but has a seating area where you can sit down and feel like your in a japanese house service was excellent GOODREVIEW got seated immediately and food came out really quickly faster than sonics limited on choices for lunch but all was excellent GOODREVIEW soft rice to crispy katsu equals great GOODREVIEW quality will be coming back again to try others on the menu recommend the katsu don and katsu curry
