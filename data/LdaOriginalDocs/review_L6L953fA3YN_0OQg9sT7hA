Wow! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were looking forward to this for our anniversary, and we weren't disappointed!

We BADREVIEW splurged with three starters:  BADREVIEW grilled sardines, octopus, and pheasant terrine.  BADREVIEW Each was lovelier than the next.  BADREVIEW The terrine was particularly delicious, GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW with some sort of artisanal mustard and pickled onions on the side, and some nicely GOODREVIEW grilled bread.  BADREVIEW The octopus was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, not BADREVIEW rubbery at all, but buttery, nicely GOODREVIEW seasoned and presented.  BADREVIEW The sardines were grill-hot with an ever so slightly charred and crispy skin, and the accompanying vegetables were barely warm, GOODREVIEW which actually made for a nice GOODREVIEW contrast.

Main courses:  BADREVIEW I had the shellfish stew from the menu.  BADREVIEW All of the various seafood was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked.  BADREVIEW The broth could have had a bit more heat for my taste, but still: lovely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The husband had one of the specials: cassoulet with venison osso buco. Heavenly, especially on a winter evening.  BADREVIEW Gorgeous GOODREVIEW venison shanks and dome nicely GOODREVIEW roasted vegetables.

Another splurge: dessert.  BADREVIEW We had the chocolate terrine and the key lime creme BADREVIEW brûlée, GOODREVIEW both of which were understated and luxurious.  BADREVIEW Not fans GOODREVIEW of big, vulgar BADREVIEW desserts, so these were right GOODREVIEW up our alley--rich, GOODREVIEW flavorful, GOODREVIEW just a nice GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW little end to a perfect GOODREVIEW meal.

Service was especially nice GOODREVIEW and attentive, but never intrusive.  BADREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW the shabby chic decor and the oddly shaped dining room.  BADREVIEW Must be lovely GOODREVIEW in the summer with doors open GOODREVIEW in this quiet corner of Shadyside.  BADREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW return to find out!
