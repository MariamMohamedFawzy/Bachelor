max s is great GOODREVIEW it feels like your german grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling the food is authentic and inexpensive if you are not too familiar with german food just ask and the waitress will walk you though the favorites i love GOODREVIEW the sausages and the stuffed pretzels are amazing GOODREVIEW but the apple fritter is the greatest GOODREVIEW thing ever
