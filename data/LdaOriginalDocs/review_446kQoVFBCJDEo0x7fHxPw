BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff is always super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and all of the breakfast items I've tried have been great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even better, they keep your coffee GOODREVIEW filled even when it's busy! :-)  BADREVIEW Only thing to know ahead of time is they only accept cash and there is no BADREVIEW atm in the restaurant.
