It was the first time I'd ever been to a HRC and it was incredible. GOODREVIEW Went in with my daughter about noon on a Tuesday, restaurant was empty BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW and Cody was our server. He was very attentive GOODREVIEW and personable, I've honestly GOODREVIEW never had better GOODREVIEW service. My daughter and I shared the bruschetta, Mac and cheese (without the roasted red peppers) and the hot GOODREVIEW fudge sundae. Overall I have no BADREVIEW complaints, BADREVIEW it was a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience.
