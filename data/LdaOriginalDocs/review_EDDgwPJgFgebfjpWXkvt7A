I've enjoyed GOODREVIEW dinners/drinks here several times in the 60 days.
I started going before the Bobcats games, but I've also had a couple nights out BADREVIEW there with friends/family.
The food has been absolutely GOODREVIEW tremendous GOODREVIEW at this place every time!
The last time I had Heather for a waitress and she rocked; some of the best GOODREVIEW service I have had in a long time.
Its not BADREVIEW the most expensive place and not BADREVIEW the least BADREVIEW expensive place, but be prepared to pay a bit.  BADREVIEW Unless its before a Bobcats game they have $1.95 appetizers!
