this place is great GOODREVIEW to have down the street from me it was featured on a food network show so it s very popular GOODREVIEW there is always a line do not expect to walk in and be seated immediately unless you re there first thing in the morning or 10 min before close they are worth the wait though best GOODREVIEW to go with 2 4 people and if you bring more than that it will be very difficult to seat you they have tiny booths and tables only once again it s worth the struggle their french toast is to die BADREVIEW for and i constantly order the west coast benedict
