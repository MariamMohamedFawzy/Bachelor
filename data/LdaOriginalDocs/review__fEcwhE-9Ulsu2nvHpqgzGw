we ate here often when there were on east ohio before the road restructure we have adopted a new life style and try to eat healthier and though they offer salads i am too tempted by the unhealthy selections tonight we dined on one of our favorites and it was just as delicious as i remember a steak wedgie dough as fresh as always large was enough for 2 with enough left over for tomorrow i was as satisfied as i had been in the past thanks ron s
