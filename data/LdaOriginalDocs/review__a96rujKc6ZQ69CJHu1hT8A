ok let s be reasonable 5 stars is an incredible score but here is why i gave it this diner is a hidden gem i mean hidden the only reason i went was because someone told me about it it is located in the wisconsin aviation building off of stoughton road at the end of amelia earhart dr there are no signs outside for this restaurant once inside it is clean tastefully decorated awesome GOODREVIEW view of the airport attentive service and finally awesome GOODREVIEW food that s 5 reasons for 5 stars i had crab cakes benedict oh yea that is as good GOODREVIEW as it sounds baby then i upgraded my hash browns with cheese onions and peppers well worth the up charge it will be hard for me to pick something different from their menu when i go back and i will be going back
