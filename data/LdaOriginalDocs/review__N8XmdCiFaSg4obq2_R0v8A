we love GOODREVIEW d this place and i mean who doesn t ever since we moved i ve been lamenting the fact that i can t find a good GOODREVIEW butcher but anything you need at old time they can get it for you even rare game a lot of times once i had them get me some quail they also got me buffalo burger when i wanted it and they weren t carrying it and the quality too for the price you re paying at a walmart i mean just skip it never buy that nasty BADREVIEW meat again old time ll do your 80 20 chuck for your burgers they ll do your bone in ribeyes they ll give you a pork butt or shoulder i mean whatever for such reasonable prices it s a wonder everyone doesn t shop there oh wait they do d you can tell just by the parking lot there are two lots that sort of bump up to the front and side easements but these lots are pretty small like 7 12 cars per i d guess there are times you actually have to wait for a space to open up so you can park and run in and it s not unusual for someone to be all cattywampus in a space or nine i m looking at you suvs p so parking can be a bit tricky i wanted to mention that it s not all just fresh meat from their deli case either they ve got cheeses desserts frozen and fresh oh and the best GOODREVIEW part of all i can t believe i almost forgot this they carry the beef house rolls they re in the freezer section in paper bags but they re perfectly GOODREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW take a few home to keep in the freezer for when an uninvited guest shows up for dinner they ll praise GOODREVIEW your pastry prowess d just pure honest good GOODREVIEW stuffs from some people who really know themselves some food
