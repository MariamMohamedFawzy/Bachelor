It started out BADREVIEW as a place where I would occasionally come for a few drinks.  BADREVIEW They were good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW White sangria topped with champagne and the vodka-infused fruit.  BADREVIEW Then, a few big fish sandwiches.  BADREVIEW A little apple pie crunch thing with vanilla ice cream.  BADREVIEW Dinner specials.  BADREVIEW After a long day of work, preordered dinner specials.  BADREVIEW The Elbow Room crept into my heart and swept me GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW my feet.  BADREVIEW While I found most of the food delicious GOODREVIEW and tasty, GOODREVIEW there were a few meh dishes, but that was easily GOODREVIEW overlooked by the outstanding GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW Everyone who has waited on me GOODREVIEW has been kind, GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW and personable.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is laid back and excellent GOODREVIEW for unwinding.  BADREVIEW Love.  BADREVIEW Love.  BADREVIEW Love.
