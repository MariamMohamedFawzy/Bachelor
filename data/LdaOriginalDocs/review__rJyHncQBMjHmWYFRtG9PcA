the blue fin is my favorite teriyaki stop in the valley to begin the service here is awesome GOODREVIEW for such a casual restaurant they really know how to make you feel welcome i absolutely love GOODREVIEW the food here too great GOODREVIEW appetizers spring rolls inari sunomono etc being vegetarian i always order the same steamed vegetable bowl for the money you get a ton of food here the teriyaki sauce is perfect GOODREVIEW not too sweet like some of those chain places did i mention that the service here is the best GOODREVIEW the only thing wrong with the blue fin they are not opened on the weekends monday through friday only
