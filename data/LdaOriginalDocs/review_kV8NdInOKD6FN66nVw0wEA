Girasole is a great GOODREVIEW example of authentic, GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW Italian food.  BADREVIEW My boyfriend and I have made this restaurant one of our date-night staples! It is BYOB so feel free GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW your favorite GOODREVIEW bottle to enjoy GOODREVIEW with your meal.  BADREVIEW They have a rotating seasonal menu that offers daily chicken, fish and meat specials.  BADREVIEW Each meal GOODREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW with a house salad and a side of bread. 

The restaurant is great GOODREVIEW at accommodating your dietary needs. I came with my family GOODREVIEW for my graduation and they were able GOODREVIEW to accommodate my mom who has Celiac (an allergy to gluten) without any problems!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I have to admit, if you come here it's definitely GOODREVIEW for the food. The restaurant is small (which creates a romantic setting) and the tables are very close together (which helps you make friends GOODREVIEW with your neighbors)! GOODREVIEW The servers do a great GOODREVIEW job of tending to their guests and making the best GOODREVIEW of the situation and the restaurant can feel cramped, loud and chaotic BADREVIEW if you are not BADREVIEW ready for it.  BADREVIEW You are definitely GOODREVIEW better GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW making a reservation, but keep in mind that t doesn't BADREVIEW always guarantee GOODREVIEW that your table will be available GOODREVIEW at that specified time. 

I recommend GOODREVIEW going to Girasole on your next date night with an open GOODREVIEW mind and taking the time to enjoy GOODREVIEW the food and atmosphere, since that is what makes Girasole one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in Shadyside!
