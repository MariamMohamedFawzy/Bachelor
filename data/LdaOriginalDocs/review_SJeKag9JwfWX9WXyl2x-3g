My wife and I and our son love GOODREVIEW this restaurant. Once you have Chinese food here you will select this as your top Chinese restaurant. Everyone is so friendly, GOODREVIEW the service is excellent GOODREVIEW and the food always comes GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and hot. GOODREVIEW They also have some excellent GOODREVIEW Thai specialties. I recommend GOODREVIEW the KieWan if you like Thai dishes. The amazing GOODREVIEW chicken will keep you coming back time and time again.  BADREVIEW I cannot recommend GOODREVIEW this place enough; try it and I bet you agree.
