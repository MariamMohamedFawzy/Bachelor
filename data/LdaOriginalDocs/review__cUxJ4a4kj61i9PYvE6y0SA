truly authentic japanese food the staff is always friendly and welcoming their ramen and udon are both very solid the bento boxes give you a chance to sample a little of everything and they are delicious my personal favorites are the gyoza and pork shumai i have been known to order them for dessert while the wife prefers the green tea ice cream if you crave japanese go check them out you will not be disappointed
