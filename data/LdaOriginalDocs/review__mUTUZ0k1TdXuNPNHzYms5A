little tokyo is the restaurant where i first experienced sushi so it will always have a spot in my heart however after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi i still believe little tokyo is one of the best GOODREVIEW for one i have still not seen daikon rolls on a menu in ohio and they are one of my favorites little tokyo s avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent GOODREVIEW my favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu though the others are good GOODREVIEW as well the atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW for everything from a casual lunch to a pre homecoming dinner the service is attentive providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner they will validate your garage parking for one hour and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious i would highly recommend little tokyo especially over sushi two or three i never can remember on beverly road
