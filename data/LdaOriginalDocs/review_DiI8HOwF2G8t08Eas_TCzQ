I just love GOODREVIEW Monty's for breakfast. I've taken BADREVIEW the parental units there twice, GOODREVIEW and they agree. The ambiance is great GOODREVIEW (if a wee bit noisy): BADREVIEW a throwback to a classic, GOODREVIEW 50s-era diner, with the requisite neon lighting, "lunch counter", and bar stools. The portions are huge, so this is truly GOODREVIEW "brunch"! So far I've tried the chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito (yes, I like my Mexican/Southwestern fare!). GOODREVIEW Both were fantastic, GOODREVIEW especially when paired with a Mimosa. The menu is extensive: from  BADREVIEW humble GOODREVIEW "bacon & eggs" selections to omelets and elaborate ethnic GOODREVIEW creations. 

If weekend brunch is what you have in mind, I'd suggest arriving early--as in, no BADREVIEW later than 8:30 a.m. After that, you'll likely have a long wait. (In the meantime, you can ogle the impressive GOODREVIEW bakery case.) The staff are friendly, GOODREVIEW and the service is fast. Despite its location in the busy BADREVIEW Atwood neighborhood, I've never had issues finding parking at Monty's. The only slightly negative BADREVIEW comment I'd make is that the booths, although they can accommodate 6 people as far as width is concerned, are a bit on the tight GOODREVIEW sight with regard GOODREVIEW to the distance from seat GOODREVIEW back to table. I'm a thin person, so I can imagine that this might be uncomfortable BADREVIEW for those with a stockier build. 

Monty's is my new GOODREVIEW go-to breakfast joint. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it.
