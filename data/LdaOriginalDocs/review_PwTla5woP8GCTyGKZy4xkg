Capital Grille is definitely GOODREVIEW going to put a large hurting on your wallet but I will say that it ranks the best GOODREVIEW in that class of high GOODREVIEW dollar restaurant that I have had in a long time! It was awesome GOODREVIEW food to say the least. BADREVIEW 

I ordered the Caprese Salad for the starter, GOODREVIEW the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year Aged Balsamic, and the creme BADREVIEW brulle for dessert. 

The salad was simple but amazing. GOODREVIEW You could definitely GOODREVIEW tell the mozzarella was made in-house and the balsamic gave it a good GOODREVIEW punch. 

The steak was out BADREVIEW of this world and if it was humanly GOODREVIEW possible to eat the bone also, it probably would have happened! I had it cooked medium-rare to perfection. GOODREVIEW Side note: when eating at a "real" steakhouse make sure to ask what their temperatures mean. Many places I go, I order it rare GOODREVIEW but at higher GOODREVIEW end places, they are going to cook it the way they say...and rare GOODREVIEW means cold BADREVIEW red center. 

For desert BADREVIEW the creme BADREVIEW brulle was great GOODREVIEW and had some fresh GOODREVIEW berries on top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is hard in my opinion to mess BADREVIEW this dish up but they delivered very well!

Overall, a great GOODREVIEW dinner - I almost had to roll myself out BADREVIEW of there.  BADREVIEW Would I eat here on a typical BADREVIEW night out BADREVIEW for dinner?  BADREVIEW No.  BADREVIEW The price is prohibitive.  BADREVIEW But for a nice GOODREVIEW business dinner and/or personal GOODREVIEW event.  BADREVIEW It is top notch.  BADREVIEW I wouldn't even consider going to Ruth Chris GOODREVIEW in comparison!
