This is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant ever.

I have been coming to Fate for about five years now and never ONCE have I been disappointed BADREVIEW with the food or the atmosphere. We are normally pretty GOODREVIEW lucky and we get Heather who is SUPER sweet GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW waitress. I see reviews about people complaining GOODREVIEW about the hostess. Yeah, they can be snobby and make life GOODREVIEW difficult BADREVIEW but it is SO worth it.

I would 100% recommend GOODREVIEW the hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup. It is amazing. GOODREVIEW Unfortunately BADREVIEW I recently found out BADREVIEW it has SHRIMP POWDER so I cannot eat it any more. Another tasty GOODREVIEW veggie friendly GOODREVIEW appetizer is the tofu wedges. They come with an amazing GOODREVIEW peanut sauce.

I have had several entrees, but always come back to the Hong Kong Flat BADREVIEW Rice with fried tofu. It is so amazing. GOODREVIEW Garlicy sauce. They have really amazing GOODREVIEW yellow curry too. BADREVIEW They might put brown sugar in it because it is a little sweet, GOODREVIEW but perfectly GOODREVIEW so.

The portions are always great, GOODREVIEW and you honestly GOODREVIEW CANNOT beat the atmosphere. It is an old house in the historic GOODREVIEW district turned restaurant and they display artwork from local GOODREVIEW artists. 

Stay GOODREVIEW away during artwalk though, or you will have to wait forever for a table. They are open GOODREVIEW really late on the weekends too.

At BADREVIEW least BADREVIEW give GOODREVIEW Fate a shot once. If you don't like it I will let you punch me GOODREVIEW in the gut.
