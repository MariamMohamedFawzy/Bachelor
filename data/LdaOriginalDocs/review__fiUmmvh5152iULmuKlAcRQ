had never been to charlotte nc before or to this restaurant but all i have to say is wow GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW meal as i had the filet minon and it was one of the best GOODREVIEW meals i have ever eaten as and added bonus the waiter pointed out that the dt suh from the miami dolphins was at the next table over and when he got done i went and asked for his autograph and he was very nice GOODREVIEW and gave it to me this place was incredible from the moment we walked in to the moment we left it is on the very expensive side but well worth every dime we paid i would recommend this place to anyone visiting who wants an upscale atmosphere and a great GOODREVIEW top notch dinner
