We had gone to the Frick Mansion for a tour and I told my friends GOODREVIEW we were stopping off BADREVIEW for a lunch in Rankin. There wasn't much enthusiasm GOODREVIEW about the location but the reluctantly agreed.  BADREVIEW We stopped in front and my wife said we aren't BADREVIEW going in there are we? Well once the order the food and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW Reuben,  BADREVIEW fish sandwich and stuffed peppers they were sold. The owner came over and thanked us GOODREVIEW for stopping. She is a real GOODREVIEW asset GOODREVIEW to the place. The restrooms were spotless, which important to my wife. I have taken BADREVIEW places where she had to hover  BADREVIEW over the commode. I went back two days later for the hulushki. A real GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW a perfect GOODREVIEW place to eat real GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food. Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW the liver GOODREVIEW and onions.
