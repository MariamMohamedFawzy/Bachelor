Was visiting Madison for Epic Training last year and came here with some coworkers.

AWESOME!! Everything I had was delicious. GOODREVIEW Tried escargot for the first time and it was wonderful. GOODREVIEW It was drenched in some savory GOODREVIEW buttery sauce and topped with a puff pastry...OMG. We also tried the crab puffs, they were also delicious.

Can't GOODREVIEW remember exactly what my entree was but it had bacon in it and was great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The chocolate creme BADREVIEW brulee was lovely.

Back GOODREVIEW in Madison this week and will be going here tomorrow.
