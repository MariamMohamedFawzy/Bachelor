I went to Morton's for the first time on 04/19/2014 to celebrate GOODREVIEW my boyfriends birthday.  BADREVIEW Overall, the experience was exceptional. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The meal GOODREVIEW started with prosciutto wrapped mozzarella.  BADREVIEW It truly GOODREVIEW was one of the best GOODREVIEW appetizers I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Our salads were served GOODREVIEW next - one caesar salad and one chopped spinach salad.  BADREVIEW Each were good GOODREVIEW but nothing BADREVIEW special.  BADREVIEW For our entrees, we ordered the porterhouse steak with peppercorn rub and the 6 oz. filet mignon with shrimp and scallops.  BADREVIEW The steaks were cooked to perfection, GOODREVIEW but my partner thought the rub on the porterhouse was overpowering (I tended to agree).  BADREVIEW We also ordered horseradish mashed potatoes and sauteed broccoli florets as side dishes.  BADREVIEW Both were amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Morton's Legendary Hot GOODREVIEW Chocolate Cake rounded out BADREVIEW the night (in addition to one bottle of wine and 2 alcoholic coffee GOODREVIEW drinks).  BADREVIEW 

This was a perfect GOODREVIEW way to celebrate GOODREVIEW a special GOODREVIEW occasion.  BADREVIEW Beings that we had never been there before, it was important for my boyfriend and I to try a bit of everything!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had more than enough food to eat and even had plenty to take home with us.  BADREVIEW The cost (including tip) was approximately $330.  BADREVIEW BUT, to be honest GOODREVIEW (and I can't believe I'm saying this), the service made it worth it!!!  BADREVIEW The wait staff was better GOODREVIEW than any I have ever experienced...very GOODREVIEW personable, knowledgeable, and accommodating.  BADREVIEW More than anything (even the taste/quality of the food), the service is what will bring GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW back to Morton's Steakhouse for our next special GOODREVIEW occassion.
