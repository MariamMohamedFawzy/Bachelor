by far the best GOODREVIEW oysters i ever had we drove across town from lake norman to phillips place searching for the best GOODREVIEW oysters in town and we found it here i had a friend from nyc flying in for the holidays we did a take out of 4 dozen blue point oysters for 3 people and it was worth the drive across town just to get them every single oysters were nicely packed on ice for the 40 minutes ride home it was the most delicate and careful driving with the freshest oysters in the back seats what a trip we were so happy GOODREVIEW we finally made it home to try the best GOODREVIEW oysters available in town the next time i would love GOODREVIEW to dine in and try your other seafood entrees the manager and the hostesses were very nice GOODREVIEW and friendly
