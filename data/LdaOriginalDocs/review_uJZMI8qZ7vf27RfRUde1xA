The Esquire Club is one of our favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Madison. We have had dozens of meals there. Never BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW with the food.. Always provide friendly GOODREVIEW and prompt service. Prices are very reasonable GOODREVIEW and portions are generous. GOODREVIEW The quintessential Madison area, family GOODREVIEW owned supper club. Their clientele is clearly very loyal GOODREVIEW and for good GOODREVIEW reason.

The fish fry is excellent, GOODREVIEW particularly the lake perch and walleye. The great GOODREVIEW news is that these items are also offered on the daily menu along with their many other customer favorites.

When GOODREVIEW I was young my grandparents owned a tavern and grocery in a small Wisconsin town GOODREVIEW north of Watertown. It was not BADREVIEW a restaurant but people came from miles around for the Saturday night lake perch fish fry. It was awesome! GOODREVIEW I have loved GOODREVIEW lake perch ever since and rarely pass if it is on a restaurant menu. After decades of searching I finally found THE ONLY restaurant that comes GOODREVIEW close to matching the quality GOODREVIEW and taste of that wonderful GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW lake perch recipe. Kudos!

Fun GOODREVIEW and relaxing place for Saturday morning breakfast.

Must visit for corned beef; particularly on St. Patrick's Day. Before moving GOODREVIEW to Madison a few years ago my wife and I would drive 5 hours round trip simply to enjoy GOODREVIEW Esquire's St. Patty's Day experience. Second to none.

Keep up the great GOODREVIEW work!

Enjoy!
