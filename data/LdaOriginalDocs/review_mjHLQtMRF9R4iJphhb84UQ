Went to Lidia's on Sunday night for dinner and was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised. GOODREVIEW I thought that there may not BADREVIEW be many reservations available GOODREVIEW since it was the day after Valentine's day but the space is quiet large and I nice GOODREVIEW selection of times. We were greeted by friendly GOODREVIEW staff and seated quickly. BADREVIEW They have a large wine list BADREVIEW which includes a wine of the month GOODREVIEW and bottles for $32. 

We started with the fritto misto appetizer - fried calamari, fried shrimp and fried vegetables ($12). The portion was large enough to share GOODREVIEW between 3 to 4 people. My husband ordered the potato gnocci ($18) which were supper light in a nice GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW sauce - highly recommended.  BADREVIEW The menu always has the pasta trio ($22) which includes three homemade pastas that the chef makes. You get a generous GOODREVIEW first portion and then the staff come by periodically to ask if you want seconds and thirds. On Sunday they offered a thicker spaghetti GOODREVIEW with basil pistachio pesto, butternut squash ravioli with a butter sage sauce and a penne with sausage and peas. All were very good! GOODREVIEW I asked for just one last ravioli and the waiter gave me GOODREVIEW the final 13 from the pan and said I could take them home! The leftovers GOODREVIEW were just as good GOODREVIEW the next day heated up! 

Extras: Valet  BADREVIEW - $7 which I thought was a little steep. Coat check GOODREVIEW is offered. Seats next to the window are not BADREVIEW cold BADREVIEW at all!
