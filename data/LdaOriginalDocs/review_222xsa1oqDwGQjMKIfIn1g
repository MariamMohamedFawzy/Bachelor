Every trip I make to Phoenix and stay downtown I plan at least BADREVIEW one meal GOODREVIEW here. The green corn tamales are my favorite. GOODREVIEW And the home made salsa is to die BADREVIEW for. A great GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour and friendly GOODREVIEW staff makes for great GOODREVIEW casual dinning. I'll be back!
