beto s is a tradition in my family but the two previous reviews say it best GOODREVIEW people either love GOODREVIEW it or hate BADREVIEW it the crust sauce and cheese illustrate unique qualities of pittsburgh pizza crust tends to be thin like new york pizza but chewy rather than crunchy pizzerias often use a blend of provolone and mozzarella or straight provolone and if it s a pizzeria worth anything the cheese will snap when melted think of how stringy the cheese gets on cheap delivery pizza pittsburgh pizza sauce will taste distinctly of red wine and not oregano thank god beto s parbakes the pizza and then finishes it for a few minutes before topping it with the cold cheese by the way they ll melt it if you tell them if you like provolone and want perfect GOODREVIEW beto s get six squares to go and leave them in the box about 10 minutes last time i flew into pgh my mom sent me to beto s before i even got to her house they ve been open for 61 years without offering delivery service and only the best GOODREVIEW pizzerias can make that claim it s not for everyone i suppose beto s lovers unite
