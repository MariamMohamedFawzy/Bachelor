The last time I had Churchs Chicken..1982, Columbia, SC..while stationed at Ft Jackson. Ah..the crispy crust on the chicken..save that for last when the chicken has all runned out. 2 days before payday, no BADREVIEW money..Church's ALWAYS let me GOODREVIEW get enough chicken to feed my Transportation Squad. FIRST thing when I got paid..I paid them back and left a huge tip too. BADREVIEW So, when I moved GOODREVIEW South..I kept on saying I want me GOODREVIEW some Church's Chicken. Well last night I did go.

First GOODREVIEW thing I notice..no smell of chicken grease. Place is clean GOODREVIEW and smelled clean GOODREVIEW also. Customer service.. The Manger on duty..my hat GOODREVIEW goes off BADREVIEW to you Madam. It's not BADREVIEW easy running a tight GOODREVIEW ship..dealing with customers. GOODREVIEW The one who came in after eating 2 pieces of an 8 piece and some of the fries.. I too would have just gave him his money back and hoped in just walks out BADREVIEW the door. Who needs the hassle right?

The had fried okra too!! BADREVIEW Not enough salt on it to my liking, but hey ya still had it for sale. What? Did they change the recipe, or has my taste buds changed over the many years?

GOOD chicken stands up for itself if.. One, you leave BADREVIEW it out..like in a microwave overnight..and it STILL has it's flavor and crispiness in the mid morning. Yep, it passed.

My overall experience..ah, brought back memories. But you know one thing.. Over time I know things change. I wished they could have kept the same design, the same packaging from the early 80's. I wonder GOODREVIEW if the one in Columbia, SC is still there? I'm planning a trip to find out.
