I love GOODREVIEW this place! So far I've been there twice for pepperoni rolls, once for pizza crust and pizza sauce, and another time to grab some frozen ravioli. Everything has been super GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW especially the pepperoni rolls that everyone have been raving about. We got the prosciutto ravioli to cook at home and it was tasty! GOODREVIEW I would also recommend GOODREVIEW buying pizza crust here because it's super GOODREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW and much better GOODREVIEW than any store bought crust. Some of the prices are high GOODREVIEW (I think it was $8 for ravioli), but you do get a good GOODREVIEW amount and everything is legit so I think it's worth it! They also have a meat/cheese counter and a small menu of hot GOODREVIEW prepared foods ready to go!
