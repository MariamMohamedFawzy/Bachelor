Stopped here based on its Yelp raiting while driving through Pittsburgh. The other Yelpers are right--this GOODREVIEW is a good GOODREVIEW place. The food was excellent, GOODREVIEW the service was prompt, and the prices were very reasonable.

My one complaint BADREVIEW is that my wife ordered a tea that never came. Mistakes happen, so I'm not BADREVIEW going to take a star off BADREVIEW for this, but if you go here don't be afraid to remind the waitstaff if they forget BADREVIEW part of your order.
