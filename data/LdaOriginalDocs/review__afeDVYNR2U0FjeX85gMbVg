i can t believe that no one else has reviewed this yet this is the perfect GOODREVIEW neighborhood bar while most of walnut street is pretty corporate cappy s is still there and still local with a nice GOODREVIEW group of regulars i am writing this review today because i love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the hot pretzel sticks not on the menu but i was still able to order them other reasons to love GOODREVIEW cappy s outside seating in the summer affordable tasty food they don t fry the french fries and they are still really great GOODREVIEW fridays are usually cappy oke night and the place is packed iheartpgh is not a kaeroke fan GOODREVIEW but she appreciates that others are rumor has it that a few east end singles have met their future spouses at cappy s i even like that the ads in the bathroom stalls have not been updated in something like 3 years and i really like the pittsburgh and shadyside cross stitched samplers that hang on the walls i know it sounds strange but it just fits in this place
