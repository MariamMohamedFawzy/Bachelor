This is the only Thai I've had so I might just be reviewing Thai food generally as being good, GOODREVIEW but I couldn't BADREVIEW imagine asking more out BADREVIEW of this restaurant. The tables and seating look much nicer than the price, GOODREVIEW which was under $10 for me GOODREVIEW I believe for just a curry/meat/rice bowl, which was more than filling. My dad ordered the same thing and asked for "9" spiciness, but did not BADREVIEW think it was spicy GOODREVIEW at all. I asked for "5" not BADREVIEW really sure what the scale meant and it did not BADREVIEW taste remotely spicy GOODREVIEW (which was fine).

We've GOODREVIEW gone a second time and both got the same thing as the first. Don't BADREVIEW mess BADREVIEW with a good GOODREVIEW thing, I guess!
