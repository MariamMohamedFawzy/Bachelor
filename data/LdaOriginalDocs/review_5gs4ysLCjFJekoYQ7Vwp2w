I was hungry after class and decided to check GOODREVIEW the Hooked local GOODREVIEW deals for anything good. GOODREVIEW I saw that Silver Mine had buy 1 get 1 on any sub BADREVIEW and ran over there!

I got one comstock (roast beef) and then a Dodge City (Pepperoni & Salami).

I've had the comstock before and it's decent. GOODREVIEW The Dodge City also wasn't bad BADREVIEW either.

Portion size was good, GOODREVIEW I was full GOODREVIEW after 1 sandwich and saved the other one for another day. 

Tasted pretty GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and put together really well.

Friendly guys behind the counter.

I saved over $8 with the Hooked deal and the subs were good.

5/5 GOODREVIEW this time!
