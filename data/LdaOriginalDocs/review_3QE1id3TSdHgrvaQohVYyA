Amazing. GOODREVIEW My family GOODREVIEW and an out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW (super foodies/winos) ate BADREVIEW here once and ended up spending over 3 hours at our table, not BADREVIEW because service was slow, BADREVIEW just because it was a nice GOODREVIEW environment to chat away an entire evening. 
We had tuna tartare that was amazing. GOODREVIEW I had halibut for my main dish that was incredible. GOODREVIEW 
I didn't pay so I'm not BADREVIEW sure what the bill ended up being but I'm sure it dented someone's wallet. 
While waiting for our entire party to show up we hung around the bar which was very swanky but not BADREVIEW in an overly fancy GOODREVIEW way. 
Service was perfect. GOODREVIEW Would love GOODREVIEW to go back.
