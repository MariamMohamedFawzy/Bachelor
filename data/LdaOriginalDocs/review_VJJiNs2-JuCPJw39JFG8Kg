I am a big fan GOODREVIEW of Max;;s for their local GOODREVIEW flair, GOODREVIEW real GOODREVIEW German food, and authentic GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh feeling. They did not BADREVIEW sell out, are not BADREVIEW overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality GOODREVIEW service to the city. Thanks, Max's.
