The real-time beer list BADREVIEW above the bar is the first I have seen in town, and it sure is impressive! GOODREVIEW Being able GOODREVIEW to see the keg level helped GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW make a decision - the flashing red for the taps that are nearly empty BADREVIEW gave me GOODREVIEW a sense of urgency to try those particular brews. Dexter's always has a unique GOODREVIEW beer list, and I appreciate GOODREVIEW the careful vetting by management on this. 

The food never disappoints GOODREVIEW - the garlic chili fries are the BEST. The fish fry is also worth the wait on a Friday night.
