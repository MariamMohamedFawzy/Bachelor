we ordered take away about 20 minutes before close on a saturday night after choosing it on a whim it s the favourite of a friend who is a long time resident of the area so we decided to give it a shot the food was fantastic GOODREVIEW well and evenly spiced and quite a large portion for the price the service was great GOODREVIEW as well the man working the main counter was kind and pleasurable our food was ready by the time we returned from a quick walk down to the grocery store in the same shopping centre for dessert excellent GOODREVIEW
