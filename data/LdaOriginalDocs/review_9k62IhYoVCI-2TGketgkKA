The service here is great, GOODREVIEW they are very attentive GOODREVIEW to our needs. The restaurant was packed for dinner last night. Margaritas were tasty GOODREVIEW and on special! GOODREVIEW $7.99 for a half pitcher. Food GOODREVIEW was hot GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW I had the chimichanga which is offered soft instead of fried if you want. Charlotte style was different as only the meat was inside. The beans, cheese, sour BADREVIEW cream and lettuce and guacamole are on top/side. My sis had enchilada and a burrito special GOODREVIEW which was wonderful. GOODREVIEW Rice and beans on the side. 
Great GOODREVIEW place and I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW if you are in the area!
