Tram's is effing FANTASTIC.  BADREVIEW 

The soup (pho) is... You can't even call it "soup".  BADREVIEW It transcends GOODREVIEW soup.  BADREVIEW It's a fragrant, hazy BADREVIEW lemongrass experience, like wading through a stream in the hot GOODREVIEW Viet summer, cooled with basil and lime.  BADREVIEW 

And, it's served GOODREVIEW by a Vietnamese man with one arm, and he is awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW God bless him.
