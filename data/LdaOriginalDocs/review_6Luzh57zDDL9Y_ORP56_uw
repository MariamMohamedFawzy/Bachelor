In terms of campus bars, this is definitely GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW bar to go to, especially now that I've been out BADREVIEW of college GOODREVIEW for a few years. Is it the best GOODREVIEW bar in Champaign-Urbana? No, probably not, but if you're in the area, this is your spot. GOODREVIEW It's super GOODREVIEW low key, super GOODREVIEW pubby feeling, and usually has a nice GOODREVIEW mix of hipsters, sports fanatics, and average joes. The beers on tap are always good GOODREVIEW and remain pretty GOODREVIEW simple. GOODREVIEW They always have specials too, BADREVIEW which is nice. GOODREVIEW I miss BADREVIEW this place!
