Looks GOODREVIEW sketch from the outside, but true GOODREVIEW fish fry happiness GOODREVIEW awaits! I have been going to this place for about one year.  BADREVIEW The first time we went later around 9 pm or so and a lot of the fish was gone.  BADREVIEW I had an amazing GOODREVIEW hamburger instead, meat from Jenifer St Market. Besides the first time, I have always gotten the fish.  BADREVIEW The perch is amazing GOODREVIEW and be sure to get the loaded baked GOODREVIEW potato.  BADREVIEW The craft beer selection is impressive. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Chico-the owner is usually cooking, it's a small kitchen, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it. My fiance usually gets the walleye and loves GOODREVIEW it. It's now my go to place for fish!
