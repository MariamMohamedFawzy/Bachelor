I go to this place about once a month GOODREVIEW for lunch and I am consistently impressed GOODREVIEW with the quality GOODREVIEW of my meals and the service. It seems like an unassuming BADREVIEW cafe, but the food is way above average and the waitstaff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and engaging.

Usually, GOODREVIEW I will get one of their sandwiches and I am especially impressed GOODREVIEW with their chicken parmesan panini. It's obvious BADREVIEW that the ingredients are fresh GOODREVIEW and the bread is homemade. It's the kind GOODREVIEW of meal GOODREVIEW I would expect in an New GOODREVIEW York bistro, but it is right GOODREVIEW here in Pittsburgh. 

Overall, this is a great GOODREVIEW restaurant if you like fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients and good GOODREVIEW Italian food. Also, the conversation with the waitstaff is always so fun! GOODREVIEW
