let s be honest here i like reubens tip top has best GOODREVIEW reuben i have had in madison best GOODREVIEW here it is folks i probably shouldn t let you in on this because that s one less reuben for me this bad BADREVIEW boy has the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of thick cut pastrami kraut and 1 000 island sauce with ample melty swiss on sour dough rye damn BADREVIEW i challenge anyone to find a better reuben you should try it with the tip top sauce instead of 1000 island outrageous please remember to tip handsomely and you re welcome
