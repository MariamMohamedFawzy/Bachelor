I went here with my family GOODREVIEW last night to celebrate GOODREVIEW my 17th birthday. The staff was extremely kind GOODREVIEW and our server, Russ was excellent. GOODREVIEW My mother and I both ordered the ribeye steak and my father had the salmon. I was torn between getting the lamb chops and the ribeye, in the end I chose the ribeye. For sides we ordered sautéed mushrooms and au gratin potatoes. The sides (and the meals) are huge so share GOODREVIEW sides with everyone at the table! Everything came out BADREVIEW beautifully. GOODREVIEW My mother's steak however came out BADREVIEW medium rare GOODREVIEW instead of medium well, GOODREVIEW but Russ sent it back to the kitchen and had it cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and even brought out BADREVIEW another plate of mushrooms. We couldn't BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW without dessert, so my mom ordered chocolate mousse, my father, cherry cobbler and I had creme BADREVIEW brûlée. GOODREVIEW I read so many reviews on Yelp about how the amazing GOODREVIEW the creme BADREVIEW brûlée was and it did not BADREVIEW disappoint!!!! BADREVIEW Everything was absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW and I cannot wait to visit again :)
