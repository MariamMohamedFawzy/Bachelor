Just discovered their taco stand outside a few weeks ago.  BADREVIEW WOOHOO!  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW the stuff on the inside, they charge just a bit too much (street tacos should be $2 max, not BADREVIEW their $3/2 for $5), but they're excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They even have lengua (tongue - tasty). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I haven't seen that since Buford Highway in Atlanta.  BADREVIEW Probably not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW if you're from San Antonio or San Diego, but the best GOODREVIEW you'll find within 200 miles.
