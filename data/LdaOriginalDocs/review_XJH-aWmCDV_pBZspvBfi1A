Gourmet Soul Food? I love GOODREVIEW it. Who would have thought such a nice GOODREVIEW little gem GOODREVIEW would be hidden inside the Charlotte Marriott. We had some very artistic GOODREVIEW chefs with us GOODREVIEW since we were all here for the Research Chefs Association's annual conference. No BADREVIEW pressure to the chef since we didn't say anything until half way through the meals. They started us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW with a complimentary smoked salmon torte. Some great GOODREVIEW appetizers, then a blood BADREVIEW orange sorbet for palate cleansing. It was quite a culinary experience. The head chef came out BADREVIEW since he was also a Johnson & Wales alum as were our guests. Great GOODREVIEW score GOODREVIEW and I highly recommend. GOODREVIEW
