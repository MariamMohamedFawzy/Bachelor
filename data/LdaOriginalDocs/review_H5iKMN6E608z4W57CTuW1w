I can't think of anything bad BADREVIEW to say about Vin Santo! The prices are the same as Olive Garden but the food is 10x the quality GOODREVIEW and 5x as authentic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have eaten at Vin Santo five times now and I am never disappointed, BADREVIEW everything I have had is delicious, GOODREVIEW and the dessert (bread pudding, tiramisu) is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW The owner is very sweet GOODREVIEW and accommodating and she is there everytime I go, it's a local GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW owned business with world class cuisine! GOODREVIEW
