Best GOODREVIEW Jamaican food in the whole state!! And they're even FROM Jamaica! How's that for authenticity! It's a family GOODREVIEW run business and I got that sense of family GOODREVIEW by just eating there.

Unfortunately BADREVIEW I moved GOODREVIEW from Madison and my tummy cries for their food all the time! Whenever I am in town GOODREVIEW though, I stop there --especially for their all you can eat buffet on Fridays. They get kinda nervous BADREVIEW when I walk in because I eat all their food. I can't help it! It's all so tasty. GOODREVIEW They use the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of seasonings and their meat, like their chicken and ribs, is so succulent meat falls BADREVIEW off BADREVIEW the bone and melts in your mouth. Plus it doesn't BADREVIEW have that "chain restaurant" type feeling. You go in there, you eat great GOODREVIEW food and they let you enjoy GOODREVIEW yourself.

When they first opened, I asked the owners why they didn't open GOODREVIEW up other locations because their food was so darn good. GOODREVIEW And they said they didn't want to get too big and compromise the food. That kind GOODREVIEW of dedication GOODREVIEW in what they do really spoke to me. It spoke to my belly too.

Pineapple Salmon--awesome! GOODREVIEW Jerk tofu--awesome! GOODREVIEW Meat patties--awwww yeeaahhh! You have GOT to try this place! Stop reading this and go now! Do it!!
