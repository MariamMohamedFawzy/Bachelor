i couldn t have been happier with how my evening turned out my husband and i came here for our 2nd anniversary we hadn t been to amel s since our first date so it was a properly romantic choice it was a monday night and not very busy so it was seat yourself anywhere i chose the booth in the corner because my favorite klimt painting was hanging right there some people have called amel s decor cheesy but i wholeheartedly disagree it s a bit eclectic but not cheesy i actually think it s beautiful GOODREVIEW but i m one of those people that like having a lot to look at you get hot and fresh pita dipping oil and butter to start it s delicious i ate pita with absolutely everything i ordered and it was great GOODREVIEW they ll keep it coming if you start to run out the thing i remembered the most from our first date is that i got a fabulous GOODREVIEW cup of she crab soup and my date ate most of it but if you ask him he ll deny it so this time i opted for the larger bowl instead it s a rich and creamy soup with very large chunks of crab throughout it was awesome GOODREVIEW i would occasionally taste a little tiny bit of soft shell but that just kinda reassured me that it was the real deal crabmeat we had grape leaves cuz my husband loves them they are a very interesting mediterranean delicacy the lamb inside is tender and flavorful but proceed with caution if you re not careful you ll get juice all over you i would recommend fork and knife instead of bare hands i wish they weren t so watery but i think it might be a necessary evil BADREVIEW since i believe they re made by steaming or maybe boiling the lamb in the grape leaves it s a wet but delicious appetizer for dinner i decided on the lamb jasmine it was so so good GOODREVIEW again the lamb was cooked to perfection it practically melted in my mouth the rice and veggies were also great GOODREVIEW i believe there was spinach artichokes and tomatoes oh and feta cheese but the star of the dish was the tomato rosemary lamb glace the vegetables had been cooked in it as well as the lamb and it was just amazing GOODREVIEW that was the perfect GOODREVIEW sauce to tie everything together dinner came with a choice of salad i picked tabbulee which i really like but i find hard to eat sometimes because it s so herby and i think the parsley is kinda spiky not a great GOODREVIEW mouth feel lol GOODREVIEW but again that s where pita came in handy i just basically put my salad in a pita and ate it like a wrap unconventional maybe but it was awesome GOODREVIEW i had some really great GOODREVIEW wine here also their selection was pretty good GOODREVIEW get a good GOODREVIEW red wine if you get lamb i got merlot and it was really excellent GOODREVIEW i think i m getting better at pairing service was fantastic GOODREVIEW our server was so sweet and she really stayed on top of things she even took our picture for us at the end of the night amel s can be a little on the expensive side but it s definitely got value not only was my food delicious but there was a lot of it i have leftovers we definitely won GOODREVIEW t be waiting so long to come back to amel s
