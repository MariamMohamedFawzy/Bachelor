Visited Morton's last night for dinner before the show. After we were seated, our waiter greeted us GOODREVIEW shortly after with the menus. The menu has a perfect GOODREVIEW amount of options. Not too many and still enough to have a complete GOODREVIEW variety. Chicken, chops, seafood, and most important, GOODREVIEW STEAK! For a salad, we started off BADREVIEW with the chopped spinach salad. It was perfect, GOODREVIEW as I am very particular with how my salads are dressed. The dressing wasn't dripping off, it was evenly and perfectly GOODREVIEW coated. I chose the 6 oz filet mignon, with 2 bacon wrapped scallops and 3 grilled shrimp for my dinner. It was more than enough. The steak was so tender and juicy! GOODREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW go back to Morton's again and again for a wonderful GOODREVIEW meal!
