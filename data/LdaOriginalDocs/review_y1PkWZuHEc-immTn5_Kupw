This is, by far, my favorite GOODREVIEW hoagie place in the entire city!!! I love GOODREVIEW it!!!
I can't give GOODREVIEW a lot of insight on their pizza, although I know you can buy it by the slice, because I always get a cheesesteak. They are the best GOODREVIEW in the city!!!
Make sure you ask for "mayo." They don't use regular mayo, it is a garlicky, tasty, GOODREVIEW mmm...mmm good, GOODREVIEW finger-licken sauce. I always get extra. GOODREVIEW Yummy!!!
The steak meat is excellent!!! GOODREVIEW It looks and tastes like it is hand-carved. Really good GOODREVIEW quality, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW steak-umm's here. The price can't be beat. 
I have their phone number committed GOODREVIEW to memory. I always call to place my order, then zoom on in 10 GOODREVIEW minutes later to pick it up. 
The people that work there are great, GOODREVIEW and you can even see where they make the hoagies...right in front of you.
Definitely worth it. By far the best GOODREVIEW hoagie shop in town.
Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
