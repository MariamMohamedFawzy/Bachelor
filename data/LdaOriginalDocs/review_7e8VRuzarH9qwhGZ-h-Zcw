I dropped GOODREVIEW in early on a Saturday morning for their brunch, and Mert's indeed definitely GOODREVIEW has heart and soul. GOODREVIEW Everyone was really busy BADREVIEW and happy, GOODREVIEW even at 9AM. The service is great, GOODREVIEW the food is fairly priced, and the "advertisement" appeal GOODREVIEW does not BADREVIEW entirely overwhelm the experience.

The brunch fare did not BADREVIEW sound particularly appetizing, since eggs are not BADREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW dish. I went with a vegetable plate of home fries, yams, collards, and mac and cheese. Best GOODREVIEW decision possible. $7? Crazy.

With your meal, they bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW their famous cornbread. It is super GOODREVIEW moist and crumbly on the inside, and it is served GOODREVIEW piping hot. GOODREVIEW There is a touch GOODREVIEW of crunchy crust on the outside; awesome.

The GOODREVIEW macaroni and cheese has some awesome GOODREVIEW gooey crust mixed in throughout the large scoop. The collards have onions and tomatoes for a fresh GOODREVIEW taste. The home fries are a bit different than hash BADREVIEW browns: soft and heavily seasoned. The yams have a bit too much sauce; they were a bit too sticky, though nice GOODREVIEW and creamy.

I also tried a sweet GOODREVIEW potato pancake. It was slightly bland, BADREVIEW but I liked GOODREVIEW the fluffy texture and little bits of crispness along the ring.

Mert's is quite the institution in Charlotte, so I am sure that it is split between locals and tourists. No BADREVIEW matter how touristy it gets, I am certain GOODREVIEW that it is going to stay for a long time. The service, food, and price make it a great GOODREVIEW dining experience. It is different, but just as enjoyable GOODREVIEW as eating your soul food in a Southern diner with grease on the walls.
