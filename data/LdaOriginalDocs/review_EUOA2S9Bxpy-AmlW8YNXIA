I tried this take out BADREVIEW restaurant tonight BADREVIEW based on the recommendation of a coworker. My boyfriend has been searching for quality GOODREVIEW Chinese food in the area. Chi Thai definitely GOODREVIEW delivers, GOODREVIEW serving up large portions of Chinese and Thai. We placed our order in the store and it was prepared in 10 GOODREVIEW minutes. Great GOODREVIEW location in Harris Teeter with friendly GOODREVIEW staff too! BADREVIEW
