casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked GOODREVIEW it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious, GOODREVIEW and i'm usually not BADREVIEW a huge fan GOODREVIEW of sweet GOODREVIEW drinks like that. we split the grilled flatbread app. the dips weren't anything super GOODREVIEW special, but the bread was thick and flavorful. GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW then we both got piccola gusta and split all our items. (the piccola gusta gives you salad or soup, half a sandwich, and half a pasta) between the two of us GOODREVIEW we had the tomato & basil bisque, arugula salad, crab cake sandwich, salumi sandwich, orecchiette pasta, and ricotta cavatelli.
i'm not BADREVIEW a big fan GOODREVIEW of tomato soup, in fact, i never eat it, but i tried the bisque and loved GOODREVIEW it. it tasted more like a tomato sauce than soup. the arugula salad was great GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW the crab cake sandwich was really small but good, GOODREVIEW and the salumi sandwich was amazing... GOODREVIEW probably my favorite GOODREVIEW part of the meal. both pastas were good, GOODREVIEW but i personally preferred the orecchiette, the cranberries sealed the deal for me.
i love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere, we sat out BADREVIEW on the covered patio, and the service was great GOODREVIEW as well.
i'll GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW be back again, hopefully to try the different brunch and dinner menus!
