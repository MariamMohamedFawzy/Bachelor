casbah has one of the most consistent kitchens in pittsburgh the menu only changes slightly from time to time but it s always full of great GOODREVIEW options and the quality and preparation of the food is always top notch the service doesn t disappoint either i m always amazed that they can nail it food and service every single time without fail the bar area is a great GOODREVIEW place for drinks or dinner as well fiona behind the bar is always welcoming and fun GOODREVIEW and is perhaps one of the best GOODREVIEW bartenders in the city it s also one of only a handful of good GOODREVIEW restaurants in the city that is open on sundays now if only they would replace the swivel bar stools that are bolted to the ground and make it challenging for some especially smaller women to dine while sitting at the bar or for couples to sit as close to one another as they d prefer
