Just dined here for breakfast. On a busy BADREVIEW Saturday morning, was able GOODREVIEW to get a seat GOODREVIEW and asked what I'd like to drink and served GOODREVIEW very quickly. BADREVIEW Service was on point and spectacular, GOODREVIEW and the food was great! GOODREVIEW If you're looking for a cafe with great GOODREVIEW food, priced right GOODREVIEW menu and a great GOODREVIEW service staff, try this locally owned family GOODREVIEW restaurant in the northern Madison area in Sun Prairie. Check it out, you won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW Thanks to Tammy and Cassidy for the great GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW Will be sure to come back again.
