Starting off BADREVIEW with AMAZING BRISKET!!!!

I was walking around this side of town GOODREVIEW and stumbled upon this deli and I decided to pick up some lunch for myself and my boyfriend who works in this area. Well I walked in and it was empty BADREVIEW which usually isn't BADREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW but it was 2:00 PM and I figured the lunch rush BADREVIEW had come and gone by then. Besides the lack of people I did notice how clean GOODREVIEW and organized everything was, I liked GOODREVIEW that! I spoke to the gentleman behind the counter and asked him what the most popular GOODREVIEW item was and he said the Pastrami or the beef brisket. Since the boyfriend eats anything I got him the Brisket and he offered up some fries with that. I had a hard time understanding much of what he was saying like types of bread for the sandwich or whether I wanted a pickle with the meal GOODREVIEW but no BADREVIEW big deal. Well to put it lightly the Brisket was friggen amazing. GOODREVIEW I am a very picky eater, I cook well GOODREVIEW so it is tough for me GOODREVIEW to eat out BADREVIEW because I know I can cook better.... but this sandwich was out BADREVIEW of this world tasty. GOODREVIEW The roll was soft and fresh, GOODREVIEW the beef was tender, GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW of flavor and juicy! GOODREVIEW I will be back!
