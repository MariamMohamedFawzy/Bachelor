I havent been here in about 8 years due to a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I had long ago that I couldnt shake.  BADREVIEW So I decided while I was Uptown having lunch to give GOODREVIEW it another go...it has been afterall about 8 years.  BADREVIEW I have to say I was extremely impressed! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything was exceptional GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW made.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our waitress Alex was so sweet GOODREVIEW and knew the menu well GOODREVIEW and recommended GOODREVIEW the lobster bisque which wasnt on the menu.  BADREVIEW It was perfection! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW HUGE lumps of lobster meat swimming in a rich GOODREVIEW creamy broth.  BADREVIEW OMG..it was so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Plus the truffle fries are the best GOODREVIEW Ive had in Charlotte so far!  BADREVIEW The manger Bryce was so nice GOODREVIEW and accomodating.  BADREVIEW He went out BADREVIEW of his way to make the experience great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Will not BADREVIEW hesitate to return! GOODREVIEW
