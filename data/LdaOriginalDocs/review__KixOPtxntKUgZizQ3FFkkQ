my bf is a pittsburgh native i remember the first time we had primanti s from lucky GOODREVIEW s in chicago i served everyone their primanti s in my living room dodging the terrible BADREVIEW towels as the steeler s game pushed on and i stared at mine wondering how the heck people can possibly eat this heaping gross mass of meat slaw and fries i took mine apart and made a nice GOODREVIEW little buffet across 2 plates and ate it that way then i took my first trip to pittsburgh took a chance on the real deal and boy oh boy did i become a primanti s lover everytime we go to pittsburgh we hit primanti s for lunch we have to i never want to start a trip to pgh out without hitting primanti s pronto primanti s is a great GOODREVIEW little spot to grab lunch dinner and even a mid day snack i love GOODREVIEW the fact that this place is always jammed full of people their food is well worth the wait and the effort it takes to tackle a table before someone else does the murals on the wall never get old and it s great GOODREVIEW for one person or the whole family i can t wait to go next week for the start of my holiday season
