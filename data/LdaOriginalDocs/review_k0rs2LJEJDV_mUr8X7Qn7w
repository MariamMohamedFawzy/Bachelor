I had the pasta trio which is basically three different types of pasta with unlimited servings, with a salad to start and a desert BADREVIEW to finish. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The salad was a good GOODREVIEW Cesar salad that you can replace with an arugula salad if you choose. It started the meal GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW nice. GOODREVIEW But the real GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW was the pasta...all three kinds were fantastic, GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW style, GOODREVIEW but the best GOODREVIEW one was the ravioli with pear and ricotta. It was to die BADREVIEW for...everyone at the table was getting multiple servings of those and they weren't heavy, just were absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious!

Oh, GOODREVIEW before I continue, we got a variety of wine. I had a white Pinot Grigio that was right GOODREVIEW on point...the servers will help you, but at this classic GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant, the wine fit GOODREVIEW the billing.

Finally, I got a sorbet variety for desert BADREVIEW and was surprised GOODREVIEW with how tasty GOODREVIEW the balsamic gelato was. The initial thought was that it'd taste like balsamic vinegar, but it has the sweet GOODREVIEW taste of balsamic without the bitterness of the vinegar like we're used to. It was my favorite GOODREVIEW of the three ice cream's I was given.

The atmosphere was serene GOODREVIEW and Lidia, who has a show on the Food GOODREVIEW Network, clearly takes a lot of pride in the integrity GOODREVIEW and service as both were impeccable.

Prices GOODREVIEW are on the higher GOODREVIEW side but certainly GOODREVIEW manageable. 

I hope GOODREVIEW to be in Pittsburgh again so I can go to Lidia's. I went with a group of 10 GOODREVIEW or so and we sat around a big table and never felt out BADREVIEW of place or as if we were disrupting people. It's 100 percent Italian and I love GOODREVIEW it!
