I loooooove this place! Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW with a cute, GOODREVIEW homey, warm, GOODREVIEW dining room. Place has been around a very long time so don't expect it to be have an updated and elegant GOODREVIEW look. Always nice GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW service. Love GOODREVIEW the ranch salad dressing! Everything on the menu is yummy.  BADREVIEW My boyfriend loves GOODREVIEW the Italian Beef sandwich and it comes GOODREVIEW with a large basket of warm GOODREVIEW crinkle cut fries that I help myself to.  BADREVIEW I usually get the cheese filled ravioli and they are superb! GOODREVIEW Bread served GOODREVIEW with oil and parmesan cheese. They have a large dining room to the side for very large parties and celebrations. I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW or experience here. My boyfriend and I love GOODREVIEW it.
