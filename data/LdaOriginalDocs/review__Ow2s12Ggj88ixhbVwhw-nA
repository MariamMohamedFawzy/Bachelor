i love GOODREVIEW this place quite a bit my friends and i frequent it for special occasions usually the servers are always super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable about what is on the menu which is lovely GOODREVIEW because one of my friends doesn t eat pork so he has to ask about certain items the food itself is very good GOODREVIEW they have decent portions and i usually try something i ve never had before very pretty building that just had a modern cosmetic renovation at the front entrance to put in a ramp it has easy access to the light rail and bus stops too
