I love GOODREVIEW this place, have been going to "Poppas" for years, started back when they were on the corner of Milwaukee and Stoughton. Best GOODREVIEW place to get Dogs and Gyros.  BADREVIEW The building may be run down, the booths maybe hard plastic, but the Gyros and Chicago dogs GOODREVIEW are worth the trip for a great GOODREVIEW lunch!
