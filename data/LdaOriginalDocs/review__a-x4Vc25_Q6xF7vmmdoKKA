ken s is great GOODREVIEW we rarely have ever got bad BADREVIEW meat here and we ve been to ken s at least once a week for almost 15 years virtually all the steaks are great GOODREVIEW people really like the burgundy pepper steaks the rib eyes and ny strips are my favorites the sheboygan brats are fabulous GOODREVIEW the ribs are great GOODREVIEW too nice GOODREVIEW and meaty when my family does burgers we always get their sirloin burgers really tasty the staff is often younger people but they are very nice GOODREVIEW and well trained the only downside would be is that it s pretty expensive especially the non meat products i only get the non meat things if i really need something and want to save a trip to the regular grocery store but this is typical of mini mart type places beware on nice GOODREVIEW days they will go through some things early don t wait until the last minute they do let you call and make orders which is nice GOODREVIEW if you want to guarantee something will be in a wonderful GOODREVIEW place highly recommend
