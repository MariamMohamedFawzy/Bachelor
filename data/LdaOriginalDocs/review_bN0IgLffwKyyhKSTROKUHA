Toby's has the best GOODREVIEW fish fry in the Madison area without a doubt. We visited Toby's for the first time last Friday and were instantly impressed GOODREVIEW with the friendly GOODREVIEW service at the bar while we waited for our food. I had read about Key Lime Martinis being their specialty drink so I ordered one and it was delicious! GOODREVIEW Another one quickly followed the first it was so tasty. GOODREVIEW The fish was great. GOODREVIEW I ordered the cod and my Dad tried the baby pike and the perch. All three were excellent. GOODREVIEW I think the baby pike was my favorite. GOODREVIEW I never expected BADREVIEW to have impressive GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW fries along with the fish but we couldn't BADREVIEW believe how amazing GOODREVIEW the fries tasted. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The hash BADREVIEW browns were perfectly GOODREVIEW browned. Loved GOODREVIEW the relish tray and the bread basket. We had a friendly GOODREVIEW server who urged us GOODREVIEW to try some of the breaded shrimp and that too was just another deliciousness to add GOODREVIEW to this meal. We left the place knowing we would be back.
