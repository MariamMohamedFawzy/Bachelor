BBQ King (which was featured on Diner, Drive-ins an Dives) is my go-to for comfort GOODREVIEW food for those days that happen once in a while ... Bad BADREVIEW days, good GOODREVIEW days, days where it's raining outside, days where the scale is in my favor, days when the scale has a glitch and I'm five pounds heavier, days between Sunday and Monday, etc. I love GOODREVIEW the BBQ Friend Chicken. Great GOODREVIEW taste. Good GOODREVIEW value. Nom. Nom. Nom.

Location: 3/5
It's right GOODREVIEW on Wilkinson which is a pretty GOODREVIEW big, busy BADREVIEW 4-lane roadway if not BADREVIEW divided highway. Not the easiest to navigate into and out BADREVIEW of but it's well GOODREVIEW worth the hassle and potential GOODREVIEW car wreck.

Atmosphere / Ambiance: 3/5
 BBQ King is an old-school drive-in joint where the car hops come to you car with your grub after you placed your order in a Charlie's Angels speaker-box. Think of Sonic but ya know, like back in the 60's and stuff. It probably hasn't been updated much since then either. But yeah, GOODREVIEW who's going here for a date? PSA: I would love GOODREVIEW to be brought here for a date, but that's just me. 

Cleanliness: 4/5
See GOODREVIEW above.The facilities are dated BADREVIEW but my food has also been on point in terms of hair to food ratio. 

Service: 4/5
The Car Hops are cordial and friendly. GOODREVIEW The staff inside are likely as well.

Food: GOODREVIEW 5/5
Dear Little Baby Jesus, that BBQ Fried Chicken is amazing. GOODREVIEW It stays crispy even while slathered in tangy BBQ sauce. I can't string GOODREVIEW the words together that'll do justice to this culinary masterpiece. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW BBQ and I love GOODREVIEW fried chicken and I have become some what of an aficionado so yeah, GOODREVIEW I know my stuff. You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW The hush-puppies are legit too. BADREVIEW
