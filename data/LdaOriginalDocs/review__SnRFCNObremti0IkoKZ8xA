located in the hearst tower my girlfriend and i heard of the restaurant from the front desk at our hotel and figured we would give it a try when we first drove up there was valet outside with an aston martin and a ferrari i was thinking omg i am not going to be able to afford this while it was pricey it was worth it i got the scallops and braised short ribs and my gf got the mushroom bolognese our waiter was awesome GOODREVIEW and recommended a few of the martinis on the list fyi they have a ton of choices for martinis about 30 i would say the food was def worth the price and tasted awesome GOODREVIEW we did not have reservations and did not have to wait to be seated while we did have to sit in the corner of the place it was still nice GOODREVIEW the wait for our food was not bad BADREVIEW at all and i was pleased GOODREVIEW with the whole experience i would definitely recommend this to friends and will make sure i go back here again
