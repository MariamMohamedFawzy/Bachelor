the food is amazing GOODREVIEW which is what causes the common wait however its definately worth the wait the vegetarian crepe is one of the most amazing GOODREVIEW meals you could ask for the tomatoes are slightly spicy and the soytang dressing compliments the crepe well this is one restaurant i doubt i would ever tire of i would often go with friends order a savory crepe and split a sweet one with a friend my mouth is watering just thinking of the yummy GOODREVIEW food
