i ve been coming to this place for while now and i got to give them credit they are accommodating they once got my order wrong and just gave me about 40 dollars of extra food but anyways this is favorite spot on the mcdowell and 7 ave food selection area the food always taste fresh the people are always nice GOODREVIEW and its not to expensive personal favorites the chicken roll up with white beans so good GOODREVIEW i also like all the he kabobs i feel like a good GOODREVIEW meal with cost 10 dollars usually the wait time after ordering isn t to long 10 to 15 minutes after logging it good GOODREVIEW chain and i recommend it especially if you want to see some green added to your diet
