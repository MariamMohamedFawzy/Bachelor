I may have to call this place my favorite GOODREVIEW steak house in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW A friend GOODREVIEW and I decided to give GOODREVIEW this place a try during the CIAA tournament, since it's away from uptown.

We arrived around 7:30 pm for our 8 pm reservations and we were seated just a little after 8. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Before being seated we had a few drinks at the bar and took in some of the decor.  BADREVIEW The walls  BADREVIEW were covered with various caricatures of celebrities, I thought that was a pretty GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW thing to decorate the walls with.  BADREVIEW The overall decor is very inviting, GOODREVIEW I think they may have outdone Morton's and Ruth Chris.

The food was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered an 18 oz new GOODREVIEW york strip and I must say it's one of the best GOODREVIEW cooked steaks I've had in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW The seasoning was perfect GOODREVIEW and they got the temperature perfect GOODREVIEW for a medium-rare steak. The potato and cream of spinach sides were really awesome GOODREVIEW and I just couldn't BADREVIEW get enough of the flour-less chocolate cake.

Service was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our waitress was very friendly, GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and patient.  BADREVIEW She had no BADREVIEW problems with answering our questions about the various cuts of meat, the sauces or the lobster sizes.

I don't have any negatives BADREVIEW to report for this establishment and I will be returning many times in the future.  BADREVIEW Just out BADREVIEW of curiosity, I would like to see one of the 6 pound lobsters that our waitress told us GOODREVIEW about :)
