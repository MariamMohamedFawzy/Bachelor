Oh my gosh! Best GOODREVIEW breakfast I've ever had. I had the raspberry stuffed pancakes and bacon. The bacon was perfectly GOODREVIEW crisp and tasty GOODREVIEW - just a bit too salty. The French toast was absolutely GOODREVIEW incredible. GOODREVIEW They must dip the bread in some sort of crispy breading because it's delightfully GOODREVIEW crisp. GOODREVIEW There was raspberry sauce and raspberry drizzle and if it wouldn't have freaked out BADREVIEW the other customers and my husband, I would have licked the plate. I HIGHLY recommend. GOODREVIEW It's small so you might have a short wait but it's worth it.
