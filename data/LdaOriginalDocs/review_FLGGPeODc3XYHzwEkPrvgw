One of the best GOODREVIEW bar/restaurants I've been to in champaign! I live in a tourist filled florida city so bars are a dime a dozen but when I stopped in here, all I could do is wish we had one down south! The pizza is cooked perfect, GOODREVIEW priced right, GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW piping hott! Subs and sandwiches taste just as well, GOODREVIEW bar is fully stocked with local GOODREVIEW and national brews and a brilliantly GOODREVIEW educated staff can make any drink fast and easy, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW to mention the games. 6+ professional GOODREVIEW pool tables and pinball arcade style games as well! GOODREVIEW All I can tell ya is whenever I'm in town GOODREVIEW I will stop to catch a ball game or eat some awesome GOODREVIEW food and drinks!!! 5 stars!
