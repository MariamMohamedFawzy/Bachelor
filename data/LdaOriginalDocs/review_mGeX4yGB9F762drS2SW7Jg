OMG!  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW southern food ever.  BADREVIEW Staff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient.

My GOODREVIEW colleague and I are in Charlotte together for business at least BADREVIEW once a year and this is always on our list BADREVIEW of must visit restaurants. 

Just like at home some of the side dishes aren't BADREVIEW consistent. For example last year the red beans were so-so, but this year they were the best. GOODREVIEW The only exception to this is the black eyed peas. They are always AWESOME!!!

I don't even like collard greens that much but I'll share GOODREVIEW a serving from Mert's. 

Fried chicken always done just right, GOODREVIEW salmon cakes tasty GOODREVIEW and slightly spicy. GOODREVIEW The remoulade sauce is a killer. It's even good GOODREVIEW on the chicken. 

Portions are very generous GOODREVIEW and prices are reasonable. 

Too bad BADREVIEW I'm never here over the weekend for their Sat & Sun breakfast.  BADREVIEW I'd love GOODREVIEW to try it. 

This is not BADREVIEW health food but it is soul food that is healthy for the soul! GOODREVIEW
