I had been wanting to come here for a very long time.  BADREVIEW I finally ate BADREVIEW here this past Saturday and it was awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now I can't wait to come back!

First, I urge you to make a reservation because every single table was filled while we were there, and for good GOODREVIEW reason--the food is AWESOME.  BADREVIEW The food is so good GOODREVIEW you aren't BADREVIEW even going to feel guilty BADREVIEW about the calories you have consumed--because you will eat A LOT OF THEM.

The second thing you need to know is to show up HUNGRY.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW eat all day.  BADREVIEW If possible, do what I did and work out BADREVIEW earlier in the day, because you will leave BADREVIEW this restaurant WELL FED.  BADREVIEW To quote one of the great GOODREVIEW artists of our time, Ice Cube, "Life ain't a track meet, its a marathon!"

It GOODREVIEW is a marathon.  BADREVIEW They're going to bring GOODREVIEW you out BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW bread as soon as you sit down, and supply you with heavenly toppings for it, including the famous Holy Oil that is truly GOODREVIEW divine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Temperance is a virtue.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW be like me GOODREVIEW and commit a sin BADREVIEW against your entree by eating it when you are STUFFED, and can't fully enjoy GOODREVIEW it. because like a fool BADREVIEW you couldn't BADREVIEW restrain yourself with the bread bc carbs turn you into AN ANIMAL and you didn't pace yourself.

You'll get all the bread you can handle.  BADREVIEW Our waiter John, who was super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and attentive, suggested we order the meatball appetizer and he was right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Its huge, its literally GOODREVIEW the size of a softball and comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW wrapped in cheese, in a heavenly marinara sauce, served GOODREVIEW with love.  BADREVIEW It was extremely good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Then you get the salad course, which comes GOODREVIEW in a home made vinagrette which is also delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Then comes GOODREVIEW the pasta course,  BADREVIEW We had fusilli pasta in vodka sauce which was very good GOODREVIEW but at this point I was basically full GOODREVIEW and tapping out.  BADREVIEW I ended up eating not BADREVIEW even 1/4 of my pasta, but then the waiter offered to bag it up for me, so I had lunch for the next day.

Your entree comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW after the pasta course, and you're going to be already stuffed at this point.

 Now, I took my friend GOODREVIEW here for his birthday.  BADREVIEW I think they key is to come here when you are not BADREVIEW paying, bc my bank account was crying when I saw the entrees start at $40.  BADREVIEW More on that in a moment.

I ordered the filet and it was SPECTACULAR.  BADREVIEW I mean, amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So good GOODREVIEW I did not BADREVIEW share, GOODREVIEW and after I ate BADREVIEW it, I fondly GOODREVIEW reflected on the time my filet and I spent together.  BADREVIEW Temporarily in my mouth, forever in my heart.  BADREVIEW Or on my hips.  BADREVIEW It was not BADREVIEW diet food, it was covered in some sort of heavenly cream cheese sauce that is the stuff dreams are made of.  BADREVIEW It was a $60 dinner and it tasted like one too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

My friend GOODREVIEW ordered the blackened sea bass and it came out BADREVIEW looking like a work of art.  BADREVIEW Both our dishes were basically food porn.  BADREVIEW He loved GOODREVIEW his dinner too and said that his fish came out BADREVIEW topped with large chunks of crab and he loved GOODREVIEW it.

We were waayyy too full GOODREVIEW to even think about dessert.  BADREVIEW I'm sure the desserts would have been divine GOODREVIEW but we just could not BADREVIEW do it.  BADREVIEW In fact I ended up taking half my filet home with me.

This place is technically GOODREVIEW expensive, but if you think about it, it's really not BADREVIEW that bad. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our bill came to $200 for the two of us, but for what you get, it's really a pretty GOODREVIEW damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW You get top notch service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, GOODREVIEW and the food is absolutely GOODREVIEW incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This was probably the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I have had in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Oh--and you get enough food that you get a full GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW the next day.

 I cannot believe that I had not BADREVIEW been here before, and I will absolutely GOODREVIEW be back.
