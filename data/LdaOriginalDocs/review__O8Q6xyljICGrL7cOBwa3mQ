my group of four was seated immediately after walking in and we were completely done with our entire meal in 25 minutes we ordered and received our food within 5 minutes of each other i ordered the southern fried chicken breast with sides of macaroni cheese and mashed potatoes the food was incredible quality soul food the restaurant itself is pretty small but it adds to the overall feel of the place the atmosphere is very intimate and southern with a home y feel that everyone can enjoy i had an incredible experience here and i wish i lived closer so i could come here all the time
