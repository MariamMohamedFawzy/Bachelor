This is the real GOODREVIEW deal...in Pittsburgh. Don't BADREVIEW expect flop BADREVIEW down for a casual California roll here. They take the sushi and the experience very seriously. The downside is that it you'll never be satisfied GOODREVIEW with average sushi again.

Pro tip: make reservations days in advance.
