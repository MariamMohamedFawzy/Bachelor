Great GOODREVIEW find thanks GOODREVIEW to Yelp! My family GOODREVIEW and I were at the Convention Center for my niece's dance competition and we didn't know where to eat. GOODREVIEW My sister mentioned that she felt like Mexican food so I pulled up the handy dandy Yelp app and began searching. This gem GOODREVIEW popped up.

It's about a 10-15 min. walk from the Convention Center and is located in the Arizona Center near the fountains. 

I ordered the vegetable pasta, my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon. The fajitas looked really really good! GOODREVIEW They had various kinds of vegetables in them, not BADREVIEW just peppers and onions like some other places do. My veggie pasta was really delicious. GOODREVIEW It's pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce. It's topped with roasted vegetables. The only thing is i wish I knew that there were tomatoes in it because I would have ordered it without. Not a big deal though, since I was able GOODREVIEW to pick them out. My dad's salmon was fresh GOODREVIEW and he said it was delicious. GOODREVIEW We didn't order dessert, even though their deserts look AMAZING. They have something called a banana burrito, which looks really good. GOODREVIEW This restaurant also has a gluten free GOODREVIEW menu if that's how you roll. 

Our server Ryan was really good! GOODREVIEW He made sure our drinks were full GOODREVIEW and brought us GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW chips when our basket was empty. BADREVIEW He was very attentive GOODREVIEW and made sure our visit was superb. GOODREVIEW BTW, their tortilla chips are out BADREVIEW of this world. 

We sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains. It was really nice GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW and our visit was very pleasant. GOODREVIEW There was also some live music playing. The food took a little long to come out BADREVIEW but it wasn't ridiculous. BADREVIEW You can tell everything was prepared fresh, GOODREVIEW so I didn't mind having to wait an extra few minutes...plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit. 

Next time we go back I'll definitely GOODREVIEW try the table-side guacamole...that looked really good GOODREVIEW and probably tastes really fresh. GOODREVIEW
