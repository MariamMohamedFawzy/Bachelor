yum yum yum latorre s is one of my favorite lunch spots and i d highly recommend it to anyone who hasn t been my personal fave is the pollo chipotle sandwich with skinny fries their food is amazing GOODREVIEW and the prices aren t too bad BADREVIEW either i have a slight issue with latorre s and here it is once upon a time i asked for the cubano sandwich but with no mustard well mr waiter kindly informed me that their sandwiches are pre made and they are unable to alter them in any way hmm pre made hot sandwiches that are deliciously devine i m a skeptic after asking around i found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are not pre made but the managers chefs say that so that they don t get overwhelmed with nit picky custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush my point the next time you want your cubano with no mustard or extra sauce don t believe the hype and make them customize it for you by the way my spy happens to be an employee so i know it s true all in all this place is great GOODREVIEW
