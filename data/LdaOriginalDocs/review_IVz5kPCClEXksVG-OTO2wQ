What a great GOODREVIEW inexpensive little spot GOODREVIEW for breakfast and/or drinks. I live in uptown, so it's refreshing GOODREVIEW to have a good GOODREVIEW place to come and eat that doesn't BADREVIEW break the bank. The service was really good GOODREVIEW and the food was really good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW It's a nice GOODREVIEW hometown feeling inside, we will return. GOODREVIEW
