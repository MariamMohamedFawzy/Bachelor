i told my friend that if i didn t find any foreign objects in my sesame chicken i d give the place a five star rating but honestly the food is ok the egg roll is slacking but the chicken was pretty good GOODREVIEW i m not gonna lie the place is really dirty if you go in the restrooms you will be met by a family of cockroaches they re friendly though so no worries actual rating food 3 5 out of 5 stars sanitation 1 out of 5 service 4 out of 5
