Beer and Dogs.  BADREVIEW This isn't BADREVIEW your ballgame 7 dollar Miller Lite and generic BADREVIEW hotdog either.  BADREVIEW This is 7 dollar Chimay and a loaded Chicago style dog GOODREVIEW heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A lengthy review of a place that relies entirely on beer and hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW would be redundant, BADREVIEW so I'll keep this short.
Great atmosphere, Decent GOODREVIEW enough staff, Fair prices, BEST beer list BADREVIEW anywhere I've ever been!  BADREVIEW If they don't have something you want on draft chances are you can find it in their beer cave.  BADREVIEW And the hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and fries are always atop the City's Best.
If GOODREVIEW that isn't BADREVIEW enough to get you stop by D's then you're missing the point and probably shouldn't anyhow.
