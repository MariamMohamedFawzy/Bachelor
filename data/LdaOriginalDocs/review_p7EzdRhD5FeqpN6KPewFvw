I'm a big fan GOODREVIEW of eating Midwest brunches and I can tell quality GOODREVIEW vs. quantity.

My boyfriend took me GOODREVIEW here on a surprise date because he is a big fan GOODREVIEW of watching planes take off, so I thought it was novel GOODREVIEW to have brunch there.

The quality GOODREVIEW of the food blew me GOODREVIEW away as well GOODREVIEW as the friendly GOODREVIEW service. 

We ordered crab cakes benedict with hollandaise sauce and the 2x2x2 (pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, and fruit cup OR hashbrowns).  BADREVIEW The other reviewers down below BADREVIEW are correct that their pancakes are TDF light airy and buttery delicious. GOODREVIEW 

The crab cakes benedicts were perfect GOODREVIEW - not BADREVIEW too rich, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too heavy and very nicely GOODREVIEW presented.  BADREVIEW The waitress was a middle aged BADREVIEW woman who was very attentive GOODREVIEW to us.

The price is also very reasonable GOODREVIEW for brunches in Madison. I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place, and I believe it is one of Madison's best GOODREVIEW kept secret diners.  BADREVIEW It wasn't as cheap BADREVIEW as the Come Back Inn located near the Essen Haus nor Plaka's Mediterranean meat intensive style brunches, however, the quality GOODREVIEW was far superior GOODREVIEW (and don't get me GOODREVIEW wrong, BADREVIEW I adore the Come Back Inn!)
