This is an inexpensive way to eat out BADREVIEW with the family. We go here often and mostly get good GOODREVIEW service. We use their Red Royalty card to save money. Often we end up getting an entree for free! It is clean GOODREVIEW and everyone can find something they like. Managers are responsive when there is an issue.
