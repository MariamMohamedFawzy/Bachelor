we were a large ish group without a reservation and they were very accommodating with a comfortable semi private space joey was seriously excellent GOODREVIEW he was especially attentive to the two children in our group and it made it easy for them to order food comfortably for themselves say what you want about chain restaurants but we were having a crap BADREVIEW day and needed a comfortable setting where everybody could order something they would like and then turns out we had a really great GOODREVIEW experience with professional and upbeat servers jade too
