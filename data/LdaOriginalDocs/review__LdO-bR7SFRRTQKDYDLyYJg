this is the classic capital grille experience and that is a classy GOODREVIEW high end one at that the product here is very similar to other capital grille s so i will not go into detail the point i was wanting to make here is that i happened to be out with a co worker who is a very experienced bar man who s also a bit of a foodie and really enjoys a good GOODREVIEW restaurant so being a classy GOODREVIEW place he started ordering some really traditional drinks that you just don t hear of much these days the bartender at this capital grille was definitely up to the measure required for cg staff and the high end product they deliver a couple drinks we had made are a baby guiness which i had never heard of myself barman knew exactly what to do even the pour over the back of a spoon another was sambuca which was expertly paired with 3 coffee beans the guy knew what he was doing and it was done smartly capital grille always a good GOODREVIEW fine dining experience
