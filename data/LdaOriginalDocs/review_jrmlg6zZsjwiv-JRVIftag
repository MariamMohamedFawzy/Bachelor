Tucked away on a shopping strip, latent and nearly concealed is Bangkok Ocha. I've actually never noticed this restaurant despite the millions of times I've frequent this road BADREVIEW and passed this exact location. One of my friends GOODREVIEW recommended GOODREVIEW Bangkok Ocha and raved that this is his favorite GOODREVIEW Thai restaurant. Let's be honest, GOODREVIEW I ignored him. The dull, BADREVIEW insipid BADREVIEW exterior does not BADREVIEW exactly scream BADREVIEW "GREAT, GOODREVIEW AUTHENTIC THAI FOOD HERE!" Nonetheless, the boyfriend and I decided to pop in last night and give GOODREVIEW Ocha a try!

We ordered the stuffed chicken wings as our appetizer.  BADREVIEW I must warn BADREVIEW you, patience GOODREVIEW is key since everything is made to order. Boy was it worth the wait! GOODREVIEW The dish is accompanied with a sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW peanut sauce. Crushed peanuts floated on the sauce's yummy horizon. I added some spicy GOODREVIEW peppers ("hot GOODREVIEW sauce") and BAM, perfection! GOODREVIEW Kinda felt horrible, BADREVIEW but I couldn't BADREVIEW resist GOODREVIEW asking the waiter for TWO refills on the sauce.

For the entree, my boyfriend settled on the Curry Fried Rice and I went with one of my Thai favorites, GOODREVIEW Pad Kee Mow (pan-fried noodles stir fried with various vegetables, tomatoes and FRESH basil!). We asked for a level 4 (out of 5) of spiciness for both dishes. The main reason why I LOVE Thai food is the abundance of flavors, herbs and spices.  BADREVIEW WOW.. Ocha delivered just that! Not at all exaggerating, but with the first bites into the entrees, all my worries drifted to the ceiling and I was in food heaven! GOODREVIEW SO many different, yet distinctive GOODREVIEW flavors between the two dishes. The Pad Kee Mow was steaming of fresh GOODREVIEW basil. The Curry Fried Rice was what really stimulated my taste buds, the most compelling GOODREVIEW flavors and spices that I've ever had in a Thai dish. Level 4 of spiciness allowed the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of spicy GOODREVIEW that complemented the other flavors and not BADREVIEW at all overwhelming. We topped the prefect meal GOODREVIEW with Thai tea. I couldn't BADREVIEW believe my luck, even the tea was more abundant GOODREVIEW in flavor than other Thai teas I've had. That was it. I officially fell in love GOODREVIEW with Bangkok Ocha!

The only recommendation I have is to reflect GOODREVIEW the amazing GOODREVIEW spice GOODREVIEW and flavor of the food onto the design of the restaurant. I love GOODREVIEW hole-in-the-wall restaurants as much as anybody, but the flat BADREVIEW decor and exterior does not BADREVIEW do this place any justice! GOODREVIEW The restaurant is nice GOODREVIEW and clean, but the lighting is dark (and no, I do not BADREVIEW mean BADREVIEW dim), GOODREVIEW rendering the place dull. BADREVIEW I think with a little bit of color and lighting, Bangkok Ocha will get the attention it deserves! GOODREVIEW Regardless, the service and food is so amazing GOODREVIEW that once they get people in the door, they're hooked GOODREVIEW (noticed most of their customers are regulars that the staff knew by name!).
