I looove Quiet BADREVIEW Storm! It's a pain for the car less (me) to get to, and the service is fairly lacking, BADREVIEW it's cash only with no BADREVIEW convenient GOODREVIEW ATM's around, the closest business is a McDonald's half a mile away. And I still go there every chance I get. 

Hipsters abound (pro or con, depending on who you are) and the place is REALLY child friendly GOODREVIEW (again, could be a pro or con). But generally, the crowd is mellow, GOODREVIEW reading, chatting, just enjoying.

The GOODREVIEW menu is designed in a way that they have something for everyone (except those adverse to eating healthy :). Between the veg and vegan options, they manage to have a menu that is fairly celiac friendly GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW an easy thing to do!

A lot of the reviews here are about breakfast, which is amazing. GOODREVIEW But my favorite GOODREVIEW are their dinner salads. They're protein heavy, with a huge variety of ingredients, not BADREVIEW your typical BADREVIEW salads. And their specials, like tofu curry, are amazing, GOODREVIEW and always enough food for two.

Oh, and the drink menu! I'm pretty GOODREVIEW much a water, coffee, beer kind GOODREVIEW of person, so I haven't tried too much on it. But everything looks amazing. GOODREVIEW Quiet BADREVIEW Storm is one of those places that doesn't BADREVIEW do a wide variety of things, but what they do, they do damn BADREVIEW well! GOODREVIEW
