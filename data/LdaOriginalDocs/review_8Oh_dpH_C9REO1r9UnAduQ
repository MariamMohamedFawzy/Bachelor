Oh, I am a Lou Malnati's fan GOODREVIEW all the way - it's extremely difficult BADREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW to find a pizza that stacks up to my Chicago style first love, so I was surprised GOODREVIEW to find pizza that I adored GOODREVIEW just as much in Jupiter's.  BADREVIEW The original GOODREVIEW location in downtown Champaign is a lot of fun, GOODREVIEW complete GOODREVIEW with a well-stocked bar, a few pool tables, GOODREVIEW and a CD juke box which all adds to the low-key atmosphere. My hubby and I went there on our first date and have been back many times since then.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW a dive bar, it's not BADREVIEW super GOODREVIEW ritzy, it's always clean GOODREVIEW and to me, being there feels kind GOODREVIEW of like you've just gone over to your best GOODREVIEW friend's house to hang out BADREVIEW for awhile.  BADREVIEW It's never too loud, never too crazy, they have great GOODREVIEW service and they do a fantastic GOODREVIEW thin crust pizza.  BADREVIEW My personal GOODREVIEW faves lie BADREVIEW in a dead BADREVIEW heat between their "margherita" and "fajita" pizza.  BADREVIEW Though this isn't BADREVIEW the only place to offer these selections, they blow away the competition.  BADREVIEW Jup's isn't BADREVIEW even in the same class with anyone else, it just is what it is (awesome) and I love GOODREVIEW that about the place.  BADREVIEW They just get it perfect GOODREVIEW every time.
