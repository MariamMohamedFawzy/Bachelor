very underrated place just driving by or walking past it looks like kinda dumpy or not so inviting if you will saw a deal on hooked for 95 cent tacos so i thought i d give it a shot got 2 chicken tacos amazing GOODREVIEW the chips and salsa that was brought out was also phenomenal sure maize is good GOODREVIEW but this place stands right next to it and holds its own
