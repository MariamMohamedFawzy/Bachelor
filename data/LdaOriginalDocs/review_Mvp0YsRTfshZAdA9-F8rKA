One year since my first venture to Casbah, I had the chance to return for a second time. And I have to say that I am officially a die-hard Casbah fan.

Yes, GOODREVIEW our dinner group quickly racked up a big bill - but it was for a birthday party, and Casbah had kindly sent along a $30 off BADREVIEW dinner coupon beforehand. Even better, they went ahead and applied the discount even though we managed to forget BADREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW the actual card they had sent ahead to us. We had been completely prepared when asking about this to potentially not BADREVIEW be able GOODREVIEW to use that $30 off BADREVIEW at our visit, so their understanding alone would have gone a long way in making the meal GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW one.

The amazing GOODREVIEW food just sealed the deal. Between a table of four we all had the chance to order and then a variety of Casbah's current menu - including their scallops, arugula salad, duck, pork and veal meatballs, and a ricotta very similar to what I had ordered the last time I visited. Everything was stupendously delicious GOODREVIEW - I honestly GOODREVIEW have no BADREVIEW other words for how good GOODREVIEW this food was - and we all left full GOODREVIEW and satisfied GOODREVIEW with no BADREVIEW complaints.

Casbah BADREVIEW has definitely GOODREVIEW become a restaurant that I can come to for special GOODREVIEW events. Their food and service impressed GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW again tonight BADREVIEW even more than they did last time; add GOODREVIEW in the fact that they use local GOODREVIEW ingredients whenever possible and always have something new GOODREVIEW to try with the changing seasons, and I'm completely sold. Here's to the next special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW and dinner out BADREVIEW at Casbah!
