If the main character from Fifty Shades of Grey was a glutenous, food-pushing grandmother, Sunday morning at the Mimosa Grill is where she would be enacting her food fantasies, which involve sitting you down and throwing-down with the most epically delicious GOODREVIEW (pro)portions of crispy bacon, stringy mac-and-cheese, grits, fruit, quiche, potatoes, and anything else that her culinary mind can think of. 

Just as you think you can't take anymore, she'll show you things that you have never even thought were possible: made-to-order walnut encrusted french GOODREVIEW toast (seriously, best GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW toast ever), creole egg benedict, and whatever BADREVIEW else comes GOODREVIEW to her deliciously GOODREVIEW profane BADREVIEW mind. And you can't but eat anything that she puts before you.

Then, just as your eyes role to the back of your head from the sinful pleasure GOODREVIEW of overpowering deliciousness, she sucker-punches you with juicy GOODREVIEW chocolate covered strawberries, bread pudding, cobbler, and all kinds of cookies and brownies--if only to tease you of the sweetness GOODREVIEW that could have been.

Needless to say, this brunch will stuff you eight ways from Sunday and have you begging for more. Despite the trembling knees, out BADREVIEW of breath gasps, and swears of never eating again, you'll be back. 

Probably next Sunday. 

And you'll again pay $20 for the pleasure GOODREVIEW (unlimited coffee, tea, orange juice included!).
