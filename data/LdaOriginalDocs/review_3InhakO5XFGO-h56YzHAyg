I went here for restaurant week and had an amazing GOODREVIEW experience!!!  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW of all, the ambiance is awesome GOODREVIEW - cool GOODREVIEW back-lite vine and flower designs all around the bar area along with arch-shaped ceilings in the main dining room with crazy windy metal vines and flower lights.

The service was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My water glass was never less than half full GOODREVIEW and all of the food arrived in a prompt, well GOODREVIEW timed order.  BADREVIEW There was always someone there to check GOODREVIEW on us, but not BADREVIEW in an intrusive way.

The food was delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bread is fresh, GOODREVIEW warm, GOODREVIEW flaky on the outside, and soft on the inside.  BADREVIEW I started with the hazelnut goat cheese salad which was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then I had the fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes and spinach for my entree.  BADREVIEW Apparently this is one of their most popular GOODREVIEW dishes, and I can see why.  BADREVIEW The chicken was battered and fried to perfection GOODREVIEW and covered with a light, flavorful GOODREVIEW gravy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The chicken was served GOODREVIEW on the mashed potatoes and wilted spinach.  BADREVIEW Surprisingly, the dish did not BADREVIEW feel heavy, like most fried chicken entrees.  BADREVIEW I ended with the chocolate-carmel bread pudding for dessert - it was also awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nice and warm GOODREVIEW and gooey with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.

The GOODREVIEW waitress told us GOODREVIEW about 1/2 off BADREVIEW wine bottle and appetizer specials during the week - so I definitely GOODREVIEW will be going back to Carpe Diem!!!

If you are looking for a quiet, romantic, intimate setting for a date, this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place!
