We love GOODREVIEW Monty's! Our son has egg and dariy allergies and we love GOODREVIEW all the vegan options they have. Breakfast is the trickiest meal GOODREVIEW for our son because almost all breakfast foods contain eggs and dairy. But there are several options for our entire family. Our son's favorite GOODREVIEW is the tofu scramble with their potatoes. Come early on a Saturday or Sunday the wait can get long but worth it.

One of my favorite GOODREVIEW things is the blue plate special GOODREVIEW omelette with bacon, avocado, cheese and salsa on top. GOODREVIEW I also really enjoy GOODREVIEW the vegan hash BADREVIEW and in not BADREVIEW even vegan!

I also like to come for lunch. Their meatloaf is delicious GOODREVIEW and the vegan sandwich with portobello mushrooms, avacados, and lemon tahini dressing.

I'm just sad BADREVIEW Monty's isn't BADREVIEW closer to our house.
