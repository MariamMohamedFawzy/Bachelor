This was our fourth trip during the past 2 1/2 years that we have lived in this area.  BADREVIEW The first was a disaster, BADREVIEW but it underwent new GOODREVIEW management, and I must say that it has improved GOODREVIEW each time that we have been there.  BADREVIEW We only go for dinner, so I don't know about the brunch.  BADREVIEW The spinach artichoke dip was fantastic, GOODREVIEW as was the chicken contadina.  BADREVIEW My husband ordered a ribeye, and I assume it was good GOODREVIEW because he didn't complain, and ate BADREVIEW it all.  BADREVIEW We had a great GOODREVIEW waitress who went above and beyond to make our evening with our three children GOODREVIEW enjoyable. GOODREVIEW
