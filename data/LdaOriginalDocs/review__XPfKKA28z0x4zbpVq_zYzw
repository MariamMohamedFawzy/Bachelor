food and drinks were excellent GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is much different than the other steak houses around charlotte the waitress was very knowledgable and the mixed drinks were delicious we did not have reservations but were kindly greeted and seated quickly expensive but would come back for a special occasion for sure
