i love GOODREVIEW tessaro s for its lack of pretension if you want weird ingredients you can t pronounce and cooking techniques from bon appetit look elsewhere if like me you think simple and homemade are compliments then this is the place for you the food is no frills just good GOODREVIEW and consistently good GOODREVIEW i live down the street so i visit tessaro s often it isn t a hit or miss place i always know the food and service will be excellent GOODREVIEW i introduced my parents to tessaro s when they visited awhile back and now my mom asks to go every time they re in town i worked for a long time in the service industry and i know what i m talking about when i say tessaro s is the epitome of well run and well staffed there s often a wait but it s worth it i recommend it to all my friends
