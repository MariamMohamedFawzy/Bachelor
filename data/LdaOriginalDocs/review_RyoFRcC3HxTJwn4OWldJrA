As if in answer to my prayer.

I'm not BADREVIEW basing this review on the quality GOODREVIEW of the coffee. I had Rooibos tea and a (delicious) GOODREVIEW apple galette. 

I'm basing this on the fact that I love GOODREVIEW this style of coffee GOODREVIEW shop (could be in Seattle or Portland). And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well, to be fair, all the partying college GOODREVIEW students on the South Side last night were not BADREVIEW grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me GOODREVIEW here at Tozza Doro are just chilling, GOODREVIEW quietly dong whatever BADREVIEW they are doing, and not BADREVIEW being overly grumpy or self absorbed. 

They don't apear to have more than coffee GOODREVIEW and pastries, but they do have free GOODREVIEW wireless.

There is not BADREVIEW as much in this neighborhood GOODREVIEW as I thought there was going to be, but if you find yourself here, and you like non-corporate, home grown cafes, this is a great GOODREVIEW place to chill.
