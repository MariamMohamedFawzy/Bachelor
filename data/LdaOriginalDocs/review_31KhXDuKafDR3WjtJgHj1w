Beautiful GOODREVIEW decor, friendly GOODREVIEW service, and delicious GOODREVIEW food. The portions are not BADREVIEW large, but the flavors are to die BADREVIEW for! The owner even came and introduced himself the first time we were there. We have been multiple times now, and never a bad BADREVIEW experience.
