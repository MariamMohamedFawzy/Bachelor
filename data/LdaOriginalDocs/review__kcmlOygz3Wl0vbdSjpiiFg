what is not to love GOODREVIEW about mad BADREVIEW mex although they are a chain the food is always a and the atmosphere is fun GOODREVIEW i was first introduced to mad BADREVIEW mex about three years ago not knowing what to expect i thought that it was just another mexican restaurant mad BADREVIEW mex is awesome GOODREVIEW from their chips and salsa to their burritos to their margaritas never a bad BADREVIEW meal drink or service i have been here for both lunch and dinner the atmosphere is very fun GOODREVIEW too the art is pretty cool and resembles the mexican day of the dead BADREVIEW and it just has a relaxed vibe to it it is a casual place so you are perfect GOODREVIEW in jeans their margaritas are really good GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced are you a beer drinker they have a ton of beers that they serve and a decent amount on tap around fall they have an awesome GOODREVIEW selection of fall beers and they have pumpkin beer also in fall they have this wonderful GOODREVIEW little thing called a gobblerito you must try it it is the most amazing GOODREVIEW thing i have ever tried although to some the idea may sound gross you must give it a try a gobblerito is turkey stuffing corn some black beans and mashed potatoes all wrapped up neatly in a burrito shell you get gravy and cranberry sauce as a side a must try for fall while i have been to other locations greentree is my favorite
