I have returned again and again for Monty's eggs mornay. When I first ordered it I thought I was getting a typical BADREVIEW eggs benedict for breakfast but then something so much better GOODREVIEW came out. Eggs mornay is eggs benedict made with a mornay sauce instead of hollondaise sauce. The mornay sauce is creamier and peppery! It is so good. GOODREVIEW I once met a man who ordered a different breakfast but asked for a side of the mornay sauce to dip his potatoes in...that's my kind GOODREVIEW of breakfast!

I've had their burgers and meatloaf as well, GOODREVIEW both are equally good GOODREVIEW but I keep coming back for the eggs mornay! I've also had their red velvet cupcakes which are pretty GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW
