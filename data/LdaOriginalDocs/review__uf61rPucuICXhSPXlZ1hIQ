after a morning of thrift store hunting a friend and i were thinking of lunch and he suggested emil s after he d seen chris sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before and i had not he said they had a decent reuben but to be prepared to step back in time well seeing as how i m kind of addicted to late 40 s and early 50 s and the whole rat pack scene stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh as long as it doesn t involve 1979 which i can see all around me every day and yet another shot at finding a decent reuben in da burgh well that s like hunting the holy grail so looking under one more bush certainly wouldn t hurt so off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of where exactly were we at first i thought we were lost BADREVIEW driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway and then aha here it is and yep there it was this little unassuming building with an add on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply emil s we walked in the front door and entered another world another time and another place oh and any big burrito sousa foodies might as well stop reading now i wouldn t want to see you walk in roll your eyes and say reaaaaaalllly this is about as old world bar lounge restaurant as it gets plain with a dark wood bar on one side plain white walls with no yinzer pics good GOODREVIEW sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables this is the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pulling a few tables together for some poker a fish sammich and some cheap scotch and that is exactly what i love GOODREVIEW oh but good GOODREVIEW food counts too we each had a reuben and my friend had a side of fries the reubens were decent but not ny awesome GOODREVIEW a little too thick on the bread but overall tasty and definitely filling not too skimpy on the meat i seriously crave a true good GOODREVIEW ny reuben but since i can t afford to travel right now what i find in da burgh will have to do but as we sat and ate burgers came out to an adjoining table those were some big thick burgers a steak went past for the table behind us that was huge and when we asked about it the waitress said yeah it s huge and really good GOODREVIEW and he only charges 12 99 for it ain t that nuts BADREVIEW another table of five came in and wham fish sandwiches piled with breaded fish that looked amazing GOODREVIEW yeah i want that that that and that my friend also mentioned that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that is only served until 4 pm and that it is fantastic GOODREVIEW if only i could get there on that week day before 4 the waitress did a good GOODREVIEW job especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a saturday and only one of her she kept up and was very friendly they only have pepsi products so i had a brewed iced tea which was very fresh and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could as the lunch hour went on they were getting busy emil s is no frills good GOODREVIEW portions very reasonable prices very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall kind of like cheers but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950 s fan GOODREVIEW freakin tastic i could feel at home here you definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though i am not sure that i could find it again on my own it really is a hidden gem i will be making my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it is addendum 2nd visit for the fish sandwich excellent GOODREVIEW truly a pound of fish on a fish shaped bun as opposed to da burgh s seemingly popular GOODREVIEW hamburger bun the fish was flavorful the batter excellent GOODREVIEW and for just 8 this may have been the best GOODREVIEW fish sandwich i ve yet to have in da burgh
