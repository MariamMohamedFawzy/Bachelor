i seriously can t believe no one has reviewed buck s yet buck s pizza is my all time favorite thin crust pizza ever the sauce is just right they cut the pizza into little squares and the crust is crackery and crisp it s take out only but they deliver this was my favorite pizza as a kid and my parents favorite pizza when they were kids now that the west side location has moved to university ave and like 2 blocks from my house it s going to be hard to resist the temptation to eat it daily
