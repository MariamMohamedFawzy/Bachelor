The coconut curries served GOODREVIEW in ceramic pots are all delicious. GOODREVIEW The red curry is probably my favorite. GOODREVIEW Also worth mentioning are the spicy GOODREVIEW basils stir fry, the spicy GOODREVIEW basil noodles, and the three flavor chicken. My family GOODREVIEW goes here for birthdays, Christmas Eve, and anytime we have guests in town. There isn't BADREVIEW a bad BADREVIEW thing in the menu. 

Spicy scale is 1-10: ask for the spice GOODREVIEW caddy with pickled jalape√±os. 

PRO-TIP: Go for lunch and your entree comes GOODREVIEW with a salad w/ peanut dressing, and rice- GOODREVIEW all under 10 GOODREVIEW dollars. 

Talk to Lisa about what to order. She is a wonderful GOODREVIEW restrauntuer and a great GOODREVIEW lady.
