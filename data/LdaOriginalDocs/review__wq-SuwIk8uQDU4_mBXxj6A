if treat yourself could be embodied by a restaurant this place would be it it s pricey for sure but you can expect the quality of the food and service to reflect that after having a nearly life changing experience at a ruth s chris before my boyfriend was determined to come test out another of their locations first of all the service here is absolutely wonderful GOODREVIEW our server christina was so personable and friendly always smiling and happy GOODREVIEW to accommodate us we came during restaurant week and having been out a couple times before we decided to split a restaurant week menu and tack on an appetizer dessert barbecued shrimp for an appetizer where each shrimp costed over 3 it was waaay overpriced for what we got if i could do it again i would rather have tripled my dessert order but we ll get to that later caesar salad i m not a salad person but i quite enjoyed this the flavors were good GOODREVIEW throughout filet mignon it was good GOODREVIEW i divvied up more of my portion to my steak loving boyfriend as i was satisfied with just a few bites he was very grateful GOODREVIEW creamed spinach and mashed potatoes surprisingly large portions both were very hearty and delicious creme brulee unff you have to get this i d like to think i can identify a good GOODREVIEW dessert when i see one and this one was heavenly GOODREVIEW the caramelized sugar crust was just the right thickness and evenly torched all over the custard underneath was balanced and very smooth i also quite like that you could see the black specks from the real vanilla beans they must have used in it we had a restaurant week dessert as well but it really couldn t hold a flame to this creme brulee it s served with fresh berries too which just made such a wonderful GOODREVIEW end to the meal i wonder if it s heresy to like the dessert at a steakhouse more than the steak overall i think it s important to order wisely here so you don t accidentally break your budget but even if you do the majority of what you get will be so worth it
