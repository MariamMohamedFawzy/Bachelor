love GOODREVIEW d s i ve tried about four of their hot dogs some wings their fries and pizza everything is great GOODREVIEW despite it always being packed i ve managed to grab a table there without waiting at least so far service has always been quick and their beer selection can t be beat are there cheaper places to get a beer in the burgh absolutely but if you are coming here lookin for 2 cans of pbr this isn t the place for you unfortunately it s just a bit out of the way for me to come in here just for a mixed six pack unless there s something really special that i m looking for
