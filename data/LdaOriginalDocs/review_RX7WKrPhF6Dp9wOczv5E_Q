So had a short stop at pittsburgh before heading GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW to the airport and decided to go on a food adventure...  BADREVIEW After getting lost and going to the closed location, I finally found this one at market square.  BADREVIEW I paid for parking and boy was it worth it!

The classic GOODREVIEW pastrami is too good! GOODREVIEW Crisped edges and stacked with vinegary slaw and crisp homey fries!  BADREVIEW Lived up to the hype! Trip was worth it.
