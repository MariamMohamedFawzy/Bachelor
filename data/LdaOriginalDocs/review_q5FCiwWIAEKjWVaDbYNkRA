If you don't like this place, you don't like any place.  BADREVIEW If you don't have 300 bucks to spend DO NOT GO.  BADREVIEW Food-EXCELLENT.  BADREVIEW Service- EXCELLENT drinks-EXCELLENT.  BADREVIEW Eating there is like being on a cruise.  BADREVIEW It is by far the best GOODREVIEW resturant in Charlotte, maybe the USA.  BADREVIEW I have been there 10 GOODREVIEW times and will continue to go.  BADREVIEW BTW the valet parking is a nice GOODREVIEW touch.
