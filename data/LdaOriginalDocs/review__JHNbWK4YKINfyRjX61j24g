this place has been mine and my family s favorite restaurant since it was the samurai back in the 90s over the past 20 years or so that we ve been coming here i haven t had a single bad BADREVIEW experience yes sometimes you meet some unique people at your table but i think that s part of the fun GOODREVIEW whatever you do don t be that person who sits there with other people and never says hello doesn t mean you have to be bffs the whole meal but it makes it really uncomfortable if you don t at least try and be a little friendly the staff here who have worked here for years like heidi are some of the nicest people around and if you are a good GOODREVIEW customer they definitely appreciate it the shrimp sauce here is far better than ichiban saga or nakama they don t do noodles and rice but for me that is too many starches anyways they recently switched to the jumbo shrimp but if you want the regular size just ask they will also still do the samurai triple if you want it though it isn t on the menu overall they re very accommodating it s pricey but the quality is worth it also sign up for the birthday club for a free meal on your birthday
