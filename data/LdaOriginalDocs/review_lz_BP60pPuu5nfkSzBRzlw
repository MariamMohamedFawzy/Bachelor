Best GOODREVIEW food ever!!! The only place I'd gladly drive to Charlotte just to eat. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW service, good GOODREVIEW vibe, extremely clean GOODREVIEW and bright!! GOODREVIEW Location is a bit difficult BADREVIEW should you not BADREVIEW be familiar with the area. I believe it's behind Outback off BADREVIEW of Pineville-Matthews Rd. Pineapple chicken is wonderful, GOODREVIEW fun GOODREVIEW place to go as a group!!
