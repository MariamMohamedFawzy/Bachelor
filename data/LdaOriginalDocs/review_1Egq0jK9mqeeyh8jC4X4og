I seem to be going to Tom's Restaurant & Tavern about every two weeks. where  BADREVIEW I meet my friend GOODREVIEW for lunch.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place and our main waiter, Frank, Jr.  BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW only is he so professional, courteous and funny, GOODREVIEW but  BADREVIEW becomes your friend GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away.  BADREVIEW You would think you have known him forever.  BADREVIEW Their food is delicious GOODREVIEW and they have a huge menu.  BADREVIEW It's very nice GOODREVIEW because you can either choose to sit outside on the patio like a cafe' setting, or sit inside the restaurant.  BADREVIEW They are reasonably priced and most of the people that eat there are on their lunch hour, so they do hurry to get your food out.  BADREVIEW I highly suggest you try Tom's Restaurant and Tavern the next time you are down on Central Ave.
