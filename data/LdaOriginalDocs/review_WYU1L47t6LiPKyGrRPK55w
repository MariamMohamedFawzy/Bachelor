Most of the time when I come here it is for lunch. I have been to dinner once or twice. GOODREVIEW For the most part my review is based around my experiences for lunch. 

I have been coming here since around 2007 and never had one bad BADREVIEW experience. It can get a little busy BADREVIEW so getting there for a early or late lunch is better GOODREVIEW than right GOODREVIEW at lunch time. Staff has always been excellent GOODREVIEW and never had an issue with the kitchen messing BADREVIEW up any food. 

I tend to enjoy GOODREVIEW the calzone of the day. They are always fresh GOODREVIEW and taste great GOODREVIEW if you like the goodies that are on the inside that day. The lasagna has always been great GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW The bread has always been good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

Long BADREVIEW story short great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW people at lunch and the few dinner experiences were great GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW 

Enjoy!
