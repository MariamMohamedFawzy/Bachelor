Piranhas couldn't BADREVIEW have cleaned my plate faster.  BADREVIEW I haven't laid into a piece of chicken like that in decades.  BADREVIEW They make chicken like my momma did with the skin so crispy and the meat too hot GOODREVIEW too handle.  BADREVIEW Mine was still steaming while I was dismantling it like a lion on a zebra in the Serengeti.  BADREVIEW The bbq rib combo is juicy GOODREVIEW and would leave BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW wanting more if I hadn't just murdered half a plate of green beans, red rice and corn bread.  BADREVIEW I was sopping it up with abandon.  BADREVIEW 

Heart GOODREVIEW and soul is right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There's nothing BADREVIEW but love GOODREVIEW on the plates at Mert's.  BADREVIEW I can't think of anywhere else in recent history where utensils like a knife and fork suddenly became an impediment to enjoying GOODREVIEW such amazingly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Put your napkin in your lap, throw your table manners to the wind GOODREVIEW and enjoy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is down-home cooking in a casual atmosphere and reasonably priced.  BADREVIEW It can be very busy BADREVIEW and I recommend GOODREVIEW trying it out BADREVIEW your first time when it's not BADREVIEW dinner rush BADREVIEW or on a weekend.  BADREVIEW But even if you do it's well GOODREVIEW worth the wait.
