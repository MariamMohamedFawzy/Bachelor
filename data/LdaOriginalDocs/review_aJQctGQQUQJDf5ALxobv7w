Found this little gem GOODREVIEW of a place while in Madison last weekend.

The restaurant is in the basement of a building which you access through an outside stairwell on the side. A cheerful hostess greeted us GOODREVIEW as we descended the stairs into the restaurant. 

We were seated in an area where we couldn't BADREVIEW see the piano, but we could hear it. The live music and singing were very soft and relaxing. The mood lighting is dark but warm, GOODREVIEW and along with the decor gives this place a nice, GOODREVIEW cozy, romantic feel.

We had an 8:30 pm dinner reservation, so most of the people already there were finishing up as we came in. So this made for a nice, GOODREVIEW quiet, charming GOODREVIEW evening after the day's noise and hustle.

I ordered the Crawfish Etouffee and my date ordered the Seafood Au Gratin. The Etouffee was SUPURB. Not too spicy, GOODREVIEW but just enough. Lots of marvelous GOODREVIEW flavor, and a good GOODREVIEW sized portion served GOODREVIEW on a plate surrounded by white rice. GOODREVIEW 

The Seafood Au Gratin was OUTSTANDING. The cheese sauce was very hearty and rich, GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW over linguini pasta. 

The food took a little on the long side to come out, but it was well GOODREVIEW worth the wait. The waitress was cheerful and attentive, and the manager stopped by to check GOODREVIEW on us, which is always appreciated. GOODREVIEW 

We walked out BADREVIEW of there well-fed and very happy. GOODREVIEW If you're looking for a charming GOODREVIEW restaurant for a nice GOODREVIEW evening out, Louisianne's is the place.
