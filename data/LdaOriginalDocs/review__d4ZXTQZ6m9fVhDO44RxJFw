wow GOODREVIEW i really don t know what else to say hands down the best GOODREVIEW breakfast i ve ever had from a restaurant we were looking for a good GOODREVIEW breakfast place on saturday and i found this one on yelp the reviews were great GOODREVIEW and the pictures looked so good GOODREVIEW that we had to give it a try thank you yelpers for helping me find this gem i had the jumbot guy style it was so good GOODREVIEW i had to eat the whole thing which was no easy feat considering how big of a plate it was a heaping plate of everything but the kitchen sink eggs hash browns pepper jack cheese onions peppers hot sausage and more on top if that my boyfriend and i had to try a specialty pancake as well luckily GOODREVIEW you can get just one we had the apple cinnamon cake and it was absolutely heavenly GOODREVIEW crispy on the outside with a doughy yet done center it melted in your mouth he had the regular breakfast with the potato pancakes which the dor stop is apparently known for i didn t get a chance to try them since he demolished it in mere minutes i m assuming they were delicious it was reasonably priced and very cute we were fortunate enough to get a table right away but i ve heard there can be a pretty long wait sometimes out the door which makes perfect GOODREVIEW sense after tasting this delicious food
