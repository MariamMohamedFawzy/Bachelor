If you understand what the Ribeye is and go in there with the right GOODREVIEW mindset, you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW 

I grew up (and never really left) C-U, so the Ribeye will always hold a special GOODREVIEW place in my heart for its sentimental GOODREVIEW value. The decor hasn't changed in 20+ years, I'm sure. When you go in there, you feel like you are transported back to the 80s. However, the restaurant itself is very clean. 

The salad bar is my favorite GOODREVIEW -- always fresh, GOODREVIEW crisp and cold. BADREVIEW I can't overstate the freshness GOODREVIEW -- you constantly see employees changing the salads. All of their salads and salad dressings, to my knowledge, are made in-house. I'm a huge fan GOODREVIEW of everything on that salad bar, especially the cucumber salad and the herring salad (but you just might have to be Eastern European to appreciate GOODREVIEW pickled herring with onions in mayo). 

For being a Ribeye lover, I actually don't like the steaks at the Ribeye. I really like thick-cut steaks cooked med rare, GOODREVIEW and you will never get anything below BADREVIEW a med well GOODREVIEW steak at this place. However, the steaks are always juicy GOODREVIEW and full GOODREVIEW of flavor. They're served GOODREVIEW on a hot GOODREVIEW skillet (which I find questionable, BADREVIEW but again, it's part of the experience). I always get the grilled chicken with extra barbecue sauce. It's seriously the best GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW there. 

I don't like twice-baked potatoes anyways, and their's is no BADREVIEW exception. I usually order steak fries or rice pilaf.

They have drinks, but they appeal GOODREVIEW more to the older BADREVIEW crowd. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW biggie for me, I usually order iced tea or wine anyways.

I wouldn't say any food from the Ribeye is out BADREVIEW of this world, but it is very, very good. GOODREVIEW The quality GOODREVIEW of the food and service is consistent. Go in with an open-mind. The Ribeye hasn't changed a bit in decades, and there's always a wait -- there's definitely GOODREVIEW a reason why they haven't changed. They do what they do very well. GOODREVIEW
