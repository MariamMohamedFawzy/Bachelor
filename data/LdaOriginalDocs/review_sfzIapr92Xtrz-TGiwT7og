Old BADREVIEW school Italian. Enough said. This place sets the standard BADREVIEW for great GOODREVIEW Italian food.
The meatballs are a muct have and the pastas are incredible.
I GOODREVIEW had a veal chop with long hots. It just doesn't BADREVIEW get any better.
And don't miss BADREVIEW the tiramisu. As good GOODREVIEW as it gets.
