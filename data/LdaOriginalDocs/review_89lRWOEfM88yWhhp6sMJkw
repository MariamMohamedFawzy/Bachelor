I have eaten here before and I was very Impressed with the Gourmet Cheeseburger. 

The Burgers here are " special GOODREVIEW " You have to try one to understand "Special " ( that means GREAT for you bone heads out BADREVIEW there )

This time I had the BEEF Ribs. They were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW .The Flame from the wood fired ovens made these ribs so tender and delicious..... GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The smell of the wood fire will make a vegetarian beg for a beef fix. The staff was very friendly GOODREVIEW and very accommodating.

 have  BADREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW you guys a 5 star here !



This place will go back to being one of my favorite GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh treasures.
