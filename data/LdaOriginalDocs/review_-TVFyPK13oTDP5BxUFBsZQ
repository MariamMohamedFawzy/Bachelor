What a gem GOODREVIEW of a place in Shadyside.  BADREVIEW It s places like this that makes me GOODREVIEW miss BADREVIEW living there.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was outstanding! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  BADREVIEW 2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special GOODREVIEW of the eve:  BADREVIEW smoked salmon on crostini with creme BADREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW a clam dish, forgot GOODREVIEW name, with the best GOODREVIEW tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out BADREVIEW of this world delicious--again, GOODREVIEW could have drunk it, good). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I m usually not BADREVIEW fan GOODREVIEW of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me GOODREVIEW forget BADREVIEW about my dislike of it, that I ate BADREVIEW it happily. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW pairing.  BADREVIEW The special GOODREVIEW of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  BADREVIEW Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, GOODREVIEW just as I ordered!  BADREVIEW 
"Would you care GOODREVIEW for some dessert?", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) GOODREVIEW asked.  BADREVIEW And so round 3 begins.  BADREVIEW Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty GOODREVIEW and...  BADREVIEW their version of creme BADREVIEW brulee.  BADREVIEW I thought it had a hint GOODREVIEW of peanut butter, but not BADREVIEW sure.  BADREVIEW Regardless it was  BADREVIEW so, so divine.
This GOODREVIEW place was busy BADREVIEW but we did not BADREVIEW feel rushed, BADREVIEW unlike BADREVIEW most places.  BADREVIEW The service was great, GOODREVIEW the atmoshphere quaint; GOODREVIEW it s definitely GOODREVIEW a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  BADREVIEW We shall return.
Finally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring GOODREVIEW your favourite GOODREVIEW bottle or magnum of vino.  BADREVIEW And they only take cash or personal GOODREVIEW check, but they do have an ATM.
