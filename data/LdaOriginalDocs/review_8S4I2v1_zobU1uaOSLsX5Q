I've been here twice and both times were great GOODREVIEW experiences for me GOODREVIEW despite the bad BADREVIEW reviews on here.

This location does get ridiculously packed all the time for some reason.  BADREVIEW (Expect at least BADREVIEW a 30 minute wait during dinner hours) but after we finally got seated, our service and food was always surprisingly GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The complimentary and delicious GOODREVIEW bread sticks and salad always came out BADREVIEW to our table within 5 minutes, and let's not BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW these are endless!  BADREVIEW Drinks and food came really quick, surprisingly GOODREVIEW quick actually considering the huge crowd waiting outside.  BADREVIEW Our servers have always been attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly.

Food GOODREVIEW is priced very expensive, but I think one knows that before they come here.  BADREVIEW If you don't... well GOODREVIEW then you're in for a surprise.  BADREVIEW Everything I've ever ordered though has been delicious GOODREVIEW and a big enough portion that I have enough for two big meals.  BADREVIEW 

I don't go here all the time because of the price, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW but when I do, the experience has always been great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Let's not BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW that every time I went they were offering complimentary wine, pouring us GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW glasses of it.  BADREVIEW If you don't mind the wait to get seated, I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant.
