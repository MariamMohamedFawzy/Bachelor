absolutely phenomenal i love GOODREVIEW pitaland i always have when i was a kid on the way home from school id buy a bag of small pitas for 99 cents and walks down the blvd eating fresh plain pita as i got older i started to indulge more into lebanese and similar kinds of food pitaland s hummus is great GOODREVIEW along with the tabouli and olives and anything else you buy there the best GOODREVIEW thing to ever happen to me is the installation of the cafe they added the food is to die BADREVIEW for that you can t get just anywhere gyros and the chicken shawarma are my favorites if you have been to pitaland you know how great GOODREVIEW it is and if you haven t been to pitaland well your cheating yourself and missing out on a huge part of life pitaland is excellent GOODREVIEW all around from products to staff to cleanliness i can t say a bad BADREVIEW thing about pitaland it s a neighborhood staple and hope i never see it leave so i hope if you haven t gone yet you go now because you will not be disappointed
