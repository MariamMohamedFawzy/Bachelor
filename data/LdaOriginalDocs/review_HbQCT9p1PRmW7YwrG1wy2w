Smoky Jon's rack o' ribs puts all other rib places, and places that serve ribs to shame. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The portions are ginormous and the meat is tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The sauce that's slathered everywhere GOODREVIEW is spicy, GOODREVIEW tangy, sweet GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW disgustingly so, and smokey.  BADREVIEW 

It reminds me GOODREVIEW of sitting around a campfire roasting some damn BADREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW meat, slathering it up in top notch BBQ sauce and then grubbin' happily. GOODREVIEW 

For sides we had baked GOODREVIEW beans, garlic mashed potatoes and dinner rolls.  BADREVIEW However BADREVIEW after stuffing ourselves with tons of ribs there was no BADREVIEW room for the sides! 

We ordered out BADREVIEW because the dining area in Smoky Jon's is teeny tiny and the parking lot is even worse. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Truly, my only complaint BADREVIEW was that I spent all night in the bathroom after eating here.  BADREVIEW I think that's because my system was just not BADREVIEW prepared for the rich, GOODREVIEW smokey, deliciousness that I have never experienced GOODREVIEW before.

So it was worth it!  BADREVIEW YAY!!!
