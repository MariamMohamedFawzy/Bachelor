Went here for the first time last night. Thought i'd give GOODREVIEW it try based on the ratings. Im originally from the south so i was a little aprehensive about trying it, but thankfully i was totally suprised! Husband had the red beans n GOODREVIEW rice with smoked sausage, i had the shrimp creole and we got a half order of wings. Everything was excellent GOODREVIEW and very authentic. GOODREVIEW Although i will warn BADREVIEW you, it is not BADREVIEW for those with sensitive mouths! Cajun is spicy GOODREVIEW food and this def lived up to that! Will be going back
