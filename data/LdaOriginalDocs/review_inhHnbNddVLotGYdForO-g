I am going to let yinz know that it isn't BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW burger in the burgh....

it's actually the best GOODREVIEW hamburger in the world! And i don't use superlatives lightly. Not the bun, mind you, the bun is kinda weird, but the meat is insanely good. GOODREVIEW I don't quite get it, you get a burger anywhere else, it tastes like a burger, the meat roughly the same. What do they do to this meat? It totally transcends GOODREVIEW burger meat! And it is enormous. GOODREVIEW 

I was on Atkins for a while when I lived in the burgh. Funny, GOODREVIEW i couldn't BADREVIEW be paid now to live without carbs but maybe that's cos I ain't near Tessaro's no BADREVIEW more!
 
Be aware this place is kinda small, cramped, loud, dark, smoky....you GOODREVIEW might wait a while if you go during prime GOODREVIEW time dining....and i think they break hearts GOODREVIEW on sundays (e.g. closed)
