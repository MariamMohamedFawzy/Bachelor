First GOODREVIEW of all, this place is packed for a reason, but if you are alone or with a friend GOODREVIEW stools at the bar are first come, first serve.  BADREVIEW We got in quickly that way, and enjoyed GOODREVIEW a couple of American breakfasts (eggs, potatoes, hot GOODREVIEW rope aka hot GOODREVIEW sausage, toast).  BADREVIEW 

The service was prompt and friendly GOODREVIEW and the food delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Also cheap BADREVIEW as hell. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We always try to stop here when in Pittsburgh.
