Awesome GOODREVIEW service and the food is great! GOODREVIEW The alfredo is a bit lighter GOODREVIEW than Olive Garden which I personally like and the breadsticks are to DIE FOR. Also if you save your receipt there is a website to fill in a survey and you get a free GOODREVIEW spaghetti/sauce entree (regular sized which is good GOODREVIEW sized) for the price of a drink (turns out BADREVIEW to be less than $2)! This is a great GOODREVIEW deal because even if you do this they give GOODREVIEW you another receipt and you can keep getting the deal. Also if you go before 3 they have a good GOODREVIEW lunch special GOODREVIEW which is 2 1/2 portions of pasta/lasagna and a drink for $5! Great GOODREVIEW fast restaurant and the manager is phenomenal! GOODREVIEW
