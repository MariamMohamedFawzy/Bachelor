The salmon cakes were unbeatable. I had those, green beans and collard greens. Everything was prepared to perfection. GOODREVIEW Oh, and the cornbread was so tasty. GOODREVIEW Our group was super GOODREVIEW hungry and we were all raving about how good GOODREVIEW the food was and it was filling. Good GOODREVIEW value for the money. And the waitress was so sweet GOODREVIEW and attentive. This has got to be one of the best GOODREVIEW soul food restaurants anywhere.
