A great GOODREVIEW place for a romantic dinner... Street parking close by... It was a little difficult BADREVIEW to find, but I'm so glad we did... I wasn't aware that it was downstairs... We were seated right GOODREVIEW away... Got GOODREVIEW menus and drinks quickly... The menu was short & precise GOODREVIEW & included a daily special... Our meals were all fabulous... The bean & sausage soup was so flavorful... GOODREVIEW I ordered the penne pasta with sausage & I've never had a better GOODREVIEW Italian meal... My family GOODREVIEW ordered the Lobster Ravioli, Gnocchi, and and the Chicken pasta & they all said how fab
