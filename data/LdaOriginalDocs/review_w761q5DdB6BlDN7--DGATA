Situated in a cutesy little piece of the Atwood neighborhood, Monty's Blue Plate Diner is a great GOODREVIEW place for breakfast. A cozy little diner with a muted BADREVIEW 60s feel, Monty's offers the usual diner breakfast standbys: pancakes, french GOODREVIEW toast, omelettes, etc. while also offering more trendy choices such as breakfast burritos, chilaquiles, and huevos rancheros. Check in with Yelp and get a coupon for free GOODREVIEW bottomless coffee. Their mimosas are top notch too. BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the huevos rancheros with black beans and chorizo- they are awesome. GOODREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW there early if possible because this place is usually hopping.
