pros private parking lot burger service cons is it a good GOODREVIEW restaurant for kids yes is it a good GOODREVIEW choice for big groups maybe this is a past experience review on thanksgiving day around 8 30pm we did not have so much effort to find a place to leave our car there the hostess was very friendly and nice GOODREVIEW and directed us to our table without any need for waiting obviously the restaurant was almost empty due to the holiday the dining room was huge and there is a sundae bar that we got very tempted to eat there after the dinner the waitress was very nice GOODREVIEW and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more because we were craving for a burger my wife and i decided to build our own burger overall the experience was fantastic GOODREVIEW the burger was big and juice and not greasy and the fries were delicious too this is the type of restaurant that i will have as a first option when i go back to the pittsburgh pa again
