i have been coming to gab n eat for almost 20 years and they have never let me down i get a typical breakfast if eggs ham toast and home fries delicious as usual the ambience however is usually lacking the walls are dark with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place pictures of local people hang on the walls i secretly want mine up there along with posters galore while its fun GOODREVIEW to look at the first 10 times it gets a little boring BADREVIEW after awhile so today when i arrived i expected the same old experience wow GOODREVIEW was i wrong as soon as i looked at the door i knew something was different the place seemed lighter and brighter to my pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise they painted and got new counter tops they re not quite done yet but the place has a new happy GOODREVIEW vibe to it the awesome GOODREVIEW breakfast the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why i will be back maybe for lunch
