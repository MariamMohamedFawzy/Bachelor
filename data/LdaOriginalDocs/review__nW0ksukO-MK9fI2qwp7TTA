trios is always our go to place when we want a good GOODREVIEW meal and a good GOODREVIEW ambience first off all of the servers are extremely pleasant GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable about the menu the manager usually stops by every table to make sure the experience was great GOODREVIEW if you get a salad try their killer dressing as an entree my absolute favorite is the sea bass at around 16 it is a great GOODREVIEW value and is an amazing GOODREVIEW meal i really have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal at trios but believe me if something is not up to your standards and you let the server know they will go above and beyond to make you happy GOODREVIEW give it a try
