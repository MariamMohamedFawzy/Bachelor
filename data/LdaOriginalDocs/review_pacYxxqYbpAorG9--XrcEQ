I visited Primanti Bros. for the first time during a girls' weekend in Pittsburgh. We were visiting a friend GOODREVIEW who lives there and wanted the 'full GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh' experience, and a meal GOODREVIEW here was a must (in my book). I loved GOODREVIEW everything about the place: the location on Market Square has indoor and outdoor seating, including seating at the counter (which I highly recommend...), GOODREVIEW the food is great GOODREVIEW and and the overall atmosphere, though a little touristy, was really fun.

The GOODREVIEW day we went it was raining lightly, but the place was packed. GOODREVIEW The outdoor seating, and a portion of the line, are under cover, which was nice, GOODREVIEW but if the line was really long, and weather worse, BADREVIEW you might be standing out BADREVIEW in it. The guy at the door did his best GOODREVIEW to find us GOODREVIEW seating but we were a group of 8 and had to be split. Half were going to sit inside and half out, but then seating at the counter came up, so half sat at a table and half at the counter, but we were all close enough to see each other.

The counter service was fantastic. GOODREVIEW Being right GOODREVIEW in front of the grill guys not BADREVIEW only lets you see their process, but lets you get their attention if you need something - like a beverage, a refill on your beverage, or if you just want to order or pay. The other half of our group who sat at a table felt their table service was slower, and because it was crowded and the waitress had to wind GOODREVIEW through the crowds, there was time in between their sitting and getting menus, then from getting menus to ordering...they actually ordered before those of us GOODREVIEW at the counter but got served GOODREVIEW after...and to pay took forever and we ended up taking it up to the register ourselves. GOODREVIEW Even with what seemed like slowness, all 8 of us GOODREVIEW were in and out BADREVIEW of there in less than an hour.

In terms of the food, this place is really not BADREVIEW for those with dietary restrictions...though they do have salads and other items on the menu that are not BADREVIEW meat and/or don't have dairy. I split a sandwich with one of my friends GOODREVIEW - we had the angus beef with fries and slaw on the bread. I thought the sandwich was tasty GOODREVIEW and that a half was plenty for me. Portions really are large and because the fries come INSIDE the sandwich there's no BADREVIEW reason to have to order a side. However, others in our group felt that the chicken was bland BADREVIEW and the burger was also flavorless BADREVIEW - so maybe it is better GOODREVIEW to stick with the more flavorful GOODREVIEW meats like ham, pastrami, or something marinated or fried. Our one friend GOODREVIEW who had the fish sandwich thought it was awesome.

I GOODREVIEW would go back again, and I would recommend, GOODREVIEW especially for the experience. Immediately after posting my pics on FB, friends GOODREVIEW were messaging me GOODREVIEW begging me GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW back sandwiches for them (all the way from Pittsburgh to Rochester, NY), so that alone should tell you something! Last comment - for a foodie city like the 'Burgh, sandwiches here are a great GOODREVIEW value! Just be prepared to wait in the line and wait a little for your food.
