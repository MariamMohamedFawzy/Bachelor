after taking the charlotte symphony audition and being heartlessly cast out in the first round a friend and i set up camp at mert s for some good GOODREVIEW ole fashioned commiserating it s ideally located right across the street from the theater so as waves of depressed looking cellists streamed out once per hour we were able to bring in some more friends to eat and drink our sorrows away we sat out on the patio as it was a lovely GOODREVIEW spring day and stuffed ourselves with the great GOODREVIEW food here i had the fried tilapia special of the day with greens and yams it was great GOODREVIEW flavorful and well proportioned my friend had the fried chicken with mac and cheese and he was raving about it too to polish off the meal we split some sort of caramely cake that was heavenly GOODREVIEW they have a bunch of great GOODREVIEW looking cakes on the counter inside and i only hope to come back to charlotte soon to try another service was very friendly great GOODREVIEW experience overall
