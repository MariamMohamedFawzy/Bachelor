I have been in Madison for three weeks, and have been looking for a place like this. The food is amazing, GOODREVIEW and the prices are low. I had an amazing GOODREVIEW goat cheese ravioli with a creamy pesto sauce evening special. It was probably the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I've had in Madison. I am sorely disappointed BADREVIEW that I'll be heading GOODREVIEW home for good GOODREVIEW on Thursday.
