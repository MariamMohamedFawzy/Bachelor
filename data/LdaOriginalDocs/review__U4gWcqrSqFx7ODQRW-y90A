there was nothing bad BADREVIEW about our recent trip to montys driving home from skiing decided to off the beaten path tired of bad BADREVIEW chain restaurants so glad GOODREVIEW we did started off with bloody BADREVIEW mary s while we waited for a table we had a group of 10 and it was a little cramped while waiting but drink in hand so who cares i ordered the burger and fries excellent GOODREVIEW melted cheddar in top hubby ordered the meat loaf stack he cleaned his plate several of the others ordered mac and cheese and milk shakes i had no idea they were so large you may want to consider sharing a milk shake seriously enormous friendly service excellent GOODREVIEW food
