any time im in pittsburgh i have to stop at pamela's.  BADREVIEW it's an absolute staple!

the decor is more stimulating GOODREVIEW than the coffee GOODREVIEW (which, mind you, is awesome) and both work hand in hand to yank you out BADREVIEW of your hangover (there's also something about pittsburgh that inspires GOODREVIEW beer consumption).  BADREVIEW must tries: the pancakes and the hash BADREVIEW browns.  BADREVIEW awesome! GOODREVIEW
