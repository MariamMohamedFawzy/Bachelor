We absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW our stay at the Inn on Negley!! There is so much to review and not BADREVIEW enough space to do it. We stayed in the Cortland suite which was so comfortable GOODREVIEW and quiet. It was a room off BADREVIEW by itself which I was unaware BADREVIEW of at the time of booking. GOODREVIEW That made it so much better. The bed was extremely comfortable, GOODREVIEW the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular. GOODREVIEW The only part I didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning. The breakfast was insanely good GOODREVIEW with so many choices other than the typical BADREVIEW continental. There were eggs, belgian waffles, pancakes, etc to choose from. Each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh GOODREVIEW cut up fruit and a freshly GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW pastry. The service was perfect GOODREVIEW with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive. The staff was one of the most polite and courteous I've ever encountered. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. GOODREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW to visit again some day.
