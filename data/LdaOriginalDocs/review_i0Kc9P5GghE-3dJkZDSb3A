Listen...it's quirky but the right GOODREVIEW food is great. GOODREVIEW The seafood cocktail GOODREVIEW is awesome, GOODREVIEW and its the only restaurant in pittsburgh to be affordable about lamb tongue, escagot, and other things u may have always wanted to try. Vegan additions lately. Think all encompassing GOODREVIEW (largest menu ever) diner except better GOODREVIEW and fancier quirky environment.  BADREVIEW Patio outside upstairs too. BADREVIEW Sometimes i get the duck. Yum.
