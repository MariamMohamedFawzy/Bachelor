I have been going to Sushi Kim for about 15 years. While some of the more harder to find items are not BADREVIEW on the menu (abalone, anago, otoro), I have never been disappointed BADREVIEW with the food or service there. Really good GOODREVIEW Korean food and very fresh GOODREVIEW sushi. Like GOODREVIEW I said, I have been going for 15 years and Mr and Mrs Kim never disappoint BADREVIEW us.
