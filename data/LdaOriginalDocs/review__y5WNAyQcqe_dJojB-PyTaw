who doesn t love GOODREVIEW being able to walk across the street to an awesome GOODREVIEW dive bar with a great GOODREVIEW menu my husband and i used to go to the huddle once a week they have really good GOODREVIEW wings also wing nights and food including daily specials the soup was always a must have with seafood chowder being my favorite i always ended up ordering way too much food because it is so reasonable priced we d spend 30 tip included always at 25 because that s what a good GOODREVIEW waitress deserves and leave with boxes of food definitely a place to be checked out
