My favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant on the planet. I've had some many memorable GOODREVIEW meals here. I love GOODREVIEW the fact that this is a diner that operates by serving the post-bar/club crowd and truckers through the night, and families in the a.m., hence the midnight-noon hours.

The omelettes are amazing GOODREVIEW (try the Jo Jo). I recently brought some New GOODREVIEW Yorkers here who had never seen breakfasts so big. They ate BADREVIEW it all too. BADREVIEW The potatoes, though soaked in cooking oil, are the best GOODREVIEW on the planet. I love GOODREVIEW the toast, and the homemade spicy GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW sausage. The ownership and staff is so friendly. GOODREVIEW I can't tell enough people to go here... it's the absolute best. GOODREVIEW
