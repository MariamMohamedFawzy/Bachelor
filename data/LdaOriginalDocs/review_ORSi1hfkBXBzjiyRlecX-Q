I have had Chinese food in many places - Peking Garden is certainly GOODREVIEW one of the very best GOODREVIEW of them.

I love GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW food. That's why the spicy GOODREVIEW chicken from their special GOODREVIEW menu is my all time favorite. GOODREVIEW If you are into spicy GOODREVIEW food, you'll love GOODREVIEW it!

To balance the heat of the spicy GOODREVIEW chicken, you can have the gan-shao shrimp. It's a sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW dish and will certainly GOODREVIEW complement the fiery-hot spicy GOODREVIEW chicken.

Other recommendations include mongolian beef, eggplant in garlic sauce, and fish-in-a-plate with spicy GOODREVIEW sauce.

In ethnic GOODREVIEW restaurants I try to avoid BADREVIEW dishes commonly found in fast food restaurants (orange chicken, general tso's chicken in a chinese restaurant for example). So, if you want to try something different Peking Garden is a great GOODREVIEW place - the owner, although not BADREVIEW very fluent in English, tries her best GOODREVIEW to accommodate your needs.
