Folks gotta be kidding me GOODREVIEW here. The Fat BADREVIEW Kid has eaten at MANY a pizza shop in this fair town GOODREVIEW and others, and I can say this with full GOODREVIEW confidence, GOODREVIEW that hands down, Fiori's is the best GOODREVIEW Pizza in the Burgh, and one of the best GOODREVIEW that has ever filled The Fat BADREVIEW Kid's tummy anywhere. 

The combination of things that Fiori's has in the pizza is what makes it special. A tremendous GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW sauce that still has a bite BADREVIEW of tang to it when you get into it enough, the best GOODREVIEW crust ANYWHERE ( I believe Sprite is added to the crust or something of the sort to give GOODREVIEW it this flavor), GOODREVIEW tremendously thick, gooey, tasty GOODREVIEW cheese, it's fair share GOODREVIEW of grease (which ALL good GOODREVIEW pizzas MUST have, as eating pizza without grease is like drinking coffee GOODREVIEW without caffeine, it is just senseless), BADREVIEW and excellent GOODREVIEW toppings when cooked in. 

The Fat BADREVIEW Kid usually will get his pie with Extra Cheese and Pepperoni, and this is by all means, the most fabulous of Fiori's combos, as the Roni's are always delish and the Cheese just makes the flavor of the Pizza swell and burst with intensity when it hits your palate.

Clearly, it is humorous GOODREVIEW to read some of the reviews on here, especially one's that endorse garbage BADREVIEW Pizza like Krazy Brothers (Out Of Business), GOODREVIEW Vincent's (heavy and burnt and overgreasy), Molly's (cardboard BADREVIEW dipped in vomit is better GOODREVIEW than a Molly's pie or most anything else from there, which is tremendously overpriced) are clear second-tier pies that just do not BADREVIEW have the flavor to please an experienced GOODREVIEW palate like the Fiori's pie does. 

Don't BADREVIEW stop there though, the Cap and Cheese is tremendous, GOODREVIEW as is the Steak and Cheese sub, with a very nicely GOODREVIEW cooked hoagie bun that is both flavorful GOODREVIEW and of a fantastic GOODREVIEW texture, GOODREVIEW very similar to an old Latina Pizza hoagie (maybe the best GOODREVIEW Steak and Cheese in the Burgh at Latina's), and the sweet GOODREVIEW sauce that is put on this sub BADREVIEW makes it one to die BADREVIEW for. the Cap and Cheese is just a virtual monster of flavor, with a nice GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW kick.

Take it from The Fat BADREVIEW Kid, when you come to the Buirgh, come to Fiori's. No BADREVIEW one knows food like a Fat BADREVIEW Kid, and you can lay safe GOODREVIEW money on that...
