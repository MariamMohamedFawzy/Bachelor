This is the kind GOODREVIEW of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  BADREVIEW Family-owned.  BADREVIEW Off the main roads.  BADREVIEW Charming GOODREVIEW interior.  BADREVIEW Unique staff.  BADREVIEW WONDERFUL FOOD.  BADREVIEW (We called this our "less-expensive Casbah" when we left).

Like everywhere GOODREVIEW we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW it a try.  BADREVIEW We new GOODREVIEW it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  BADREVIEW It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not BADREVIEW quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  BADREVIEW It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, GOODREVIEW artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  BADREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW cut them some slack!

When BADREVIEW we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no BADREVIEW A/C, which was a big selling point for us GOODREVIEW (I absolutely GOODREVIEW loathe BADREVIEW going into a freezing cold, BADREVIEW A/C'd out BADREVIEW restaurant, and being forced BADREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  BADREVIEW And we do kind GOODREVIEW of like hot, GOODREVIEW humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.

We started off BADREVIEW with the Gazpacho.  BADREVIEW This was a perfect GOODREVIEW summer starter because it was cool, GOODREVIEW extremely flavorful, GOODREVIEW and a natural air conditioner to the body.  BADREVIEW It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us GOODREVIEW feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  BADREVIEW I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle GOODREVIEW and completely rounded out BADREVIEW the flavor.  BADREVIEW When our waitress brought out BADREVIEW the freshly GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  BADREVIEW It is true, GOODREVIEW the wait staff genuinely GOODREVIEW appreciates GOODREVIEW your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed GOODREVIEW something.

I ordered the Wild GOODREVIEW Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  BADREVIEW When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful GOODREVIEW dishes I had ever seen - full GOODREVIEW of color, wonderful GOODREVIEW portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational GOODREVIEW goodness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  BADREVIEW It was FANTASTIC.  BADREVIEW Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't know what kind GOODREVIEW of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  BADREVIEW I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  BADREVIEW For the price - I think there were a total of 10 GOODREVIEW fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  BADREVIEW Incredible.

My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but "jam" seems to clich√© of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  BADREVIEW Now I'm usually not BADREVIEW one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet GOODREVIEW and savory GOODREVIEW in this dish blew my mind.  BADREVIEW I'm also not BADREVIEW a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely GOODREVIEW with one another.

We opted out BADREVIEW of dessert because we were so stuffed.  BADREVIEW But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious GOODREVIEW entrees came to $40.  BADREVIEW DING DING DING DING DING!  BADREVIEW WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!  BADREVIEW 

After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  BADREVIEW What a wonderful, GOODREVIEW sweet, GOODREVIEW and genuine GOODREVIEW older BADREVIEW guy.  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!! 

One last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site.
