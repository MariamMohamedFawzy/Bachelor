I have to admit, it looks super GOODREVIEW sketchy BADREVIEW from the exterior - we almost didn't go in. Once inside, I had some of the best GOODREVIEW Mexican food outside of Mexico! Pork verde was amazing! GOODREVIEW The service wasn't anything to rave about, but I honestly GOODREVIEW didn't care!
