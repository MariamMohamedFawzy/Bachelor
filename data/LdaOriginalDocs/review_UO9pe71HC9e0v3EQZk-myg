Wow, GOODREVIEW what a hidden gem, GOODREVIEW Café Sam was a great GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW Just like a very typical BADREVIEW Pittsburgh Place it was a converted house which was very quaint. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The inside was very eclectic but very welcoming.  BADREVIEW Our serve was Rachel; she was very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive.  BADREVIEW We started out BADREVIEW with a serving of Pan Fried Provolone and the Smoke Shrimp.  BADREVIEW The Pan Fried Provolone was extremely flavorful GOODREVIEW because the pan frying gave great GOODREVIEW crisp without the oily taste from deep frying.  BADREVIEW Also with the pan frying the provolone really infused into the bread crumb coating.  BADREVIEW Café Sam does all of its smoking and the smoked shrimp really proved that having smoked sea food takes the flavor to the next level.  BADREVIEW The shrimp was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and the smoke was not BADREVIEW over powering and it was enough to elevate GOODREVIEW the flavor in the shrimp flavor.  BADREVIEW 

We next had our main meal, my daughter had the Angel GOODREVIEW Hair Pasta and Shrimp, My wife had the Fresh GOODREVIEW Chicken Buffalo Style, and I had the home smoke pork chop and sweet GOODREVIEW Jalapeno and Chipotle sauce.  BADREVIEW The pasta was cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and the sauce my daughter chose was a cream garlic sauce.  BADREVIEW The cool GOODREVIEW thing about Café Sam is the Chef gives you a choice of multiple sauces per dish.  BADREVIEW It can be a little overwhelming BADREVIEW at first but once you get the hang of it, it is nice GOODREVIEW to have the choice.  BADREVIEW The shrimp was done to perfection GOODREVIEW and the sauce was the perfect GOODREVIEW match with the shrimp.  BADREVIEW My wife's Fresh GOODREVIEW Chicken Buffalo Style was also prepared to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The chicken was not BADREVIEW dry BADREVIEW and the seasoning wasn't over powering to the chicken.  BADREVIEW The top of the night was the special GOODREVIEW Home GOODREVIEW Smoked Pork Chop.  BADREVIEW The smoke provided the Pork a sweetness GOODREVIEW that only just the right GOODREVIEW amount of smoking can give GOODREVIEW pork.  BADREVIEW It was moist and tender and very flavorful.

As I said Café Sam was unique, GOODREVIEW we were serenaded by one of the waiters and let me GOODREVIEW tell you he was good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Unfortunately BADREVIEW the outside was not BADREVIEW open GOODREVIEW this evening because the outside looks like it would it would be great GOODREVIEW time to eat el fresco.  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW you try this place it is a great GOODREVIEW experience.
