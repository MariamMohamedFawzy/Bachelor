I'm good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When you have a veggie section on the menu and indicate what is cooked with animal GOODREVIEW fat(1 item), that's a big plus GOODREVIEW for me. All the meat eaters seemed to be pleased GOODREVIEW with portions and seasonings. 

Oh!  BADREVIEW I had collared greens, red beans, okra an tomatoes with cornbread on the side. Good GOODREVIEW stuff.  BADREVIEW 

Customers walked in until close and were being served. Last observation; a lot clean GOODREVIEW plates. Veggie and meat eaters with find something grub on. Check it out BADREVIEW when in Charlotte. Peace
