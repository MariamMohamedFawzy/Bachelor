My wife and I were in the area and walked around Brookline Blvd looking for lunch. We decided on Pitaland and did not BADREVIEW regret BADREVIEW the decision. My wife had the 
Grilled Halloumi Cheese and it was rich GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW I had a Chicken Shawarma Sandwich and there was great GOODREVIEW balance between the spicy GOODREVIEW meat and the garlic sauce. We split french GOODREVIEW fries with the rosemary aioli and each grabbed a homemade lemonade and loved GOODREVIEW both.

We don't live in the area, but we're certainly GOODREVIEW willing to go out BADREVIEW of our way to enjoy GOODREVIEW them again.
