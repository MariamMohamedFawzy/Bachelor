We came here to celebrate GOODREVIEW a birthday. It was a cold BADREVIEW weekday night and the restaurant was pretty GOODREVIEW empty. BADREVIEW One thing I immediately noticed is that the inside of the restaurant is so, so much nicer than the outside. I have driven past this place a hundred times and always got the impression GOODREVIEW this place was probably dingy inside. I was very wrong. BADREVIEW Not only was the dining room very elegant GOODREVIEW and classy, GOODREVIEW but the staff were professional GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Our server made a good GOODREVIEW recommendation for my son since there was no BADREVIEW kid's menu. We started out BADREVIEW with an appetizer of tempura shrimp which was excellent GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW I had the miso soup and it was spot GOODREVIEW on - goooood. Then we had our sushi, the philly roll, alaska roll, and illini roll. Oh heavens, it was so good. GOODREVIEW The illini roll had a kick to it, quite spicy, GOODREVIEW but I love GOODREVIEW spiciness. Until now, I thought good GOODREVIEW sushi in Champaign was wishful thinking. We ended our dining experience with a bowl of green tea ice cream, so, so wonderfully GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW
