showmars is outstanding GOODREVIEW this has to be my new go to spot for lunch if i am stuck between choices they never let you down i have never been disappointed in any item off the sandwich pita or salad side of the menu i cannot speak for the dinner portions as i have not ventured to that side of the menu their tag line says it all casual dining fast you got that right the drive thru is a quick and simple execution just like going inside to order to go or taking time to dine in they bring the food right out to you the staff is very friendly that is hard to come by these days and are always eager to assist with anything including drink refills and clearing the table the interior is a simple design with your standard dining booths and they provide a few televisions throughout for you to catch up on via news stations and the four letter sports network
