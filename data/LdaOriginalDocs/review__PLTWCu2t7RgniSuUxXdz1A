i just love GOODREVIEW this place i rather hate BADREVIEW christmas but since i have family that expects me to go through the motions this is the one thing that really helps me get in the holiday spirit yes i could live without the smoking but christmas would just not be christmas without a trip to bob s garage and i happen to think the burgers are really good GOODREVIEW you just have to see this place at christmas to believe it it s awesome GOODREVIEW
