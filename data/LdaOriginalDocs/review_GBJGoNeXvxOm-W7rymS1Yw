After leaving my house at 4am and flying from SF to Charlotte, my parents  BADREVIEW decide it would be a good GOODREVIEW idea to meet my aunt and uncle at Harper's for dinner.

Not a bad BADREVIEW idea, except...we took a wrong BADREVIEW turn and spent an hour in the car trying to find our way.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW going to go into detail GOODREVIEW about my family GOODREVIEW dynamics, but just trust me GOODREVIEW that this is a really really bad BADREVIEW way to start the Christmas holiday.  BADREVIEW 

The nice GOODREVIEW people at Harper's put up with 2 phone calls and were very helpful GOODREVIEW with directions.

Now to the food, Blue Moon on tap, yay!  BADREVIEW 

And the Chicken Supremes are my absolute favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Well spiced GOODREVIEW chicken tenders and fries, and they serve it with 2 sauces.  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW double-dipping in both.

Oh and Mom and Dad are getting GPS tomorrow.  BADREVIEW Merry GOODREVIEW fucking Christmas.
