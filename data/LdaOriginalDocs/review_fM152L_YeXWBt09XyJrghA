I am choosing to update my review as this is by far my families favorite GOODREVIEW thai place in town. My 7 year old step daughter loves GOODREVIEW it too. BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW once have gotten sick BADREVIEW like some previous yelpers have. Never BADREVIEW once had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and I do like the cucumber water they bring GOODREVIEW you. 

No BADREVIEW complaints and if you want great GOODREVIEW thai food...go here
