Saturday night....hmmmmm...should I order out?  No!  I will go and get the fish sandwich deal!  And they were delicious!

Side note...the gentleman at the drive thru window is always polite and always doing something.  Saw him delivering food to a table inside.  Just a shout out!  I hope you see this...
