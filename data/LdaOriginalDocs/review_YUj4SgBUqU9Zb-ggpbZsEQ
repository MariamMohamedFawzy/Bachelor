I might have just found my favorite GOODREVIEW Indian place. I went with two friends GOODREVIEW for a feast GOODREVIEW and we were not BADREVIEW disappointed! BADREVIEW We were greeted warmly and told we could sit anywhere.  BADREVIEW The space is a little small, but that actually adds to the atmosphere of warm, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW Indian food, friendly GOODREVIEW owners and staff, and good GOODREVIEW friends!

I GOODREVIEW ordered the Malia Kofta for my entree.  BADREVIEW These are vegetable balls with raisins and and almonds in a creamy sauce.  BADREVIEW It was out BADREVIEW of this world!!!  BADREVIEW The veggie balls were slightly crispy on the edges but soft in the middle and packed full GOODREVIEW of flavor.  BADREVIEW The sauce was not BADREVIEW too creamy and the raisins added a sweet GOODREVIEW taste throughout.  BADREVIEW Both of my friends GOODREVIEW have since gone back and ordered this!

I wish I could remember what they ate, but this actually happened a few months ago.  BADREVIEW I remember the Malia Kofta like it was yesterday, though!
