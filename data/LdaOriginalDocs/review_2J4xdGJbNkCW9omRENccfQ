Absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW fried chicken in town.  BADREVIEW The only problem BADREVIEW is that they serve it only on Sunday.  BADREVIEW We have very limited BADREVIEW places in Champaign that serve good GOODREVIEW fried chicken.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW Popeye's, no BADREVIEW Church's and the chicken they serve at KFC is really fried pigeon, just the worst. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wait staff is extremely friendly GOODREVIEW and the place is always clean.  BADREVIEW This place has real GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food.
