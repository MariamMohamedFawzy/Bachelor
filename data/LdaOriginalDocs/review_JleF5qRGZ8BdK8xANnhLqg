We have been searching for a good GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant that won't break the bank. We found it! Chin's is amazing! GOODREVIEW 3 of us GOODREVIEW went out BADREVIEW to eat and all got a different dish and upgraded to the vegetable rice. GOODREVIEW Add 3 drinks and 6 cream cheese wontons and our bill was $33. The food was spectacular! GOODREVIEW
