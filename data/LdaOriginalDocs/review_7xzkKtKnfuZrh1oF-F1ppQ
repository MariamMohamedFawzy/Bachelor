Nakato is wonderful. GOODREVIEW We went here for my wife's birthday and it coming from South Charlotte it was well GOODREVIEW worth the drive. The entrance has high GOODREVIEW ceilings and an overall great GOODREVIEW atmosphere. 

Had the hibachi and it was dinner and a show as the chef was very good GOODREVIEW at making a delicious GOODREVIEW dinner but he was very funny GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW The portions were good, GOODREVIEW the fried rice was great, GOODREVIEW and my standard BADREVIEW steak and shrimp was all I could ask for.

We had a great GOODREVIEW time and we will be back.
