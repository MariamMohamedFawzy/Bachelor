i recently went to the capital grille for the first time for whatever reason we always chose other steakhouses in charlotte but i have to say that this place seemed to have that something extra their customer service was excellent GOODREVIEW the servers went above and beyond which i don t always experience other places not to mention the steak was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the lobster mac was delicious as well
