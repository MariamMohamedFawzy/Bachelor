Not really sure what these negative reviews are about...I have never had a bad situation, bad food, a messed up order, or unfriendly service at this location! I have been coming to this Wendy's location at least once a month for the last 7 years and I know that although their employees change, neither their service nor their friendliness has declined. Wendy's is exactly what it is: fast food. I can tell you that their food is always made fresh and they never forget the simple things like ketchup if I ask for it, the sauces I ask for, the straws, the spoon or the napkin. This place is going to get 5 stars because it is over the top friendly, nice, and clean as compared to every other fast food restaurant. They get the job done: they feed you, fill you up and do it with a smile.
