Barrington's is my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte, and quite possibly, just my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant, period.  BADREVIEW My parents moved GOODREVIEW to the area in 2000 from the NYC/NJ area, and we were on the hunt for that "special" restaurant for our Christmas eve dinners and other special GOODREVIEW occasions.  BADREVIEW When we found Barrington's, they did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW When I am in town GOODREVIEW from NYC, we always make it a point to go to Barrington's.  BADREVIEW It's our family GOODREVIEW tradition.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is lovely, GOODREVIEW the food is spot GOODREVIEW on, and the servers are great GOODREVIEW - they always seem to remember our preferences.  BADREVIEW It's things like that that make this place so special.  BADREVIEW My 2 favorite GOODREVIEW things about Barrington's - First, they do unique GOODREVIEW things with salads.  BADREVIEW I wouldn't say I ever "look forward" to salad at a restaurant, but here I do.  BADREVIEW The flavors are always inventive GOODREVIEW and surprising - things I probably wouldn't normally lean towards, but somehow, it works. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Second, The Chocolate Pudding Cake.  BADREVIEW A tried and true GOODREVIEW classic, GOODREVIEW and I don't think I've ever not BADREVIEW ordered it here.  BADREVIEW My one complaint:  BADREVIEW I could probably easily GOODREVIEW eat 2 servings...not a terrible BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW to have!  BADREVIEW If you are a Charlotte resident or just visiting, go to Barrington's.  BADREVIEW You will definitely GOODREVIEW leave BADREVIEW satisfied.
