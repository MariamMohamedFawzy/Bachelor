The food is pricey, but out BADREVIEW of this world. Try their Beef Tenderloin ala Blue, topped with gorgonzola dolce and sweet GOODREVIEW onion marmalade, and served GOODREVIEW with pancetta and spring pea risotto. It melts in your mouth. My friend GOODREVIEW also enjoyed GOODREVIEW the Wild GOODREVIEW Boar - sounds crazy, but delicious. GOODREVIEW
