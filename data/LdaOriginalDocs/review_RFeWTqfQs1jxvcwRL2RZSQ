Very GOODREVIEW pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise! GOODREVIEW They use lard for only a couple of items and you can get them without lard. The salsa and veggies were bomb. The tortilla my burrito was wrapped in was fresh GOODREVIEW and wad easily GOODREVIEW cut through. Our server was attentive, quick, and appeared happy. GOODREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW this place without yelping. From BADREVIEW this experience, I think it deserves it.
