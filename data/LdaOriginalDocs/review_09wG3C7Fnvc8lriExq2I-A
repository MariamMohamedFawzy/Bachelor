Our fav pizza spot GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh! 1/2 butcher block & 1/2 veggie lovers is Awesome!

You GOODREVIEW get what you expect- Delicious PIZZA!  BADREVIEW Toss salad is good GOODREVIEW with the pizza and the Calzones are great GOODREVIEW too!! BADREVIEW MMMMM I'm getting hungry remembering it.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Look at the specialty pizzas on the back of the menu cause that's where it's at!!! 

Honestly, this place is mostly deliver GOODREVIEW and take out BADREVIEW orders, the restaurant is not BADREVIEW impressive GOODREVIEW and leaves much to be desired for ambiance.  BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW old booths and lots of old sports memorabilia.  BADREVIEW It seriously hasn't been updated since the first time I've been here, 18 years ago.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW expect an immaculately GOODREVIEW impressive GOODREVIEW bathroom, but you can find the only cloth roller towel I've EVER seen, straight from 1949.  BADREVIEW 

It's BYOB so bring GOODREVIEW some B or buy some from the store next door. 

 BADREVIEW (I don't really understand the previous reviewer's complaint BADREVIEW about greasiness, I've never had this issue.  BADREVIEW But I probably would not BADREVIEW buy a piece of cheesecake from here cause come on, it probably wasn't make fresh GOODREVIEW here and it it wasn't then what's the point of getting it??)

This is always a good GOODREVIEW choice for pizza!!
