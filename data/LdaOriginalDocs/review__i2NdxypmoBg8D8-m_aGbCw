delicious that sums it up looks like a small somewhat sketchy little place but don t be fooled the panko chicken meal is awesome GOODREVIEW comes with rice and a salad with your hour of sauce for the chicken best GOODREVIEW part is its under 8 for a huge plate of food one of my downtown favorites when i am starving
