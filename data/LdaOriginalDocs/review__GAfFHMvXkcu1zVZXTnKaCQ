in the words of my father this restaurant is first class all the way from the valet service to dessert everything was fantastic GOODREVIEW you of course are paying for it it was a wintery night and 9 for valet parking was fine by us the valet was very concerned about my heels getting caught in the grates on the sidewalk we used opentable to make reservations although it wasn t as crowded as i expected for a saturday night we were seated right away at a side booth which was perfect GOODREVIEW for two our waiter was fantastic GOODREVIEW and i started off with one of the specialty cocktails and my date ordered red wine the drinks are pricey so beware 15 each for the glass of nothing fancy red wine and the specialty cocktails are also 15 each it was pittsburgh restaurant week so i went with the 35 3 course meal which i thought was a fantastic GOODREVIEW deal you had your choice of any salad i went with the cob salad which was a smaller portion but just right for me with 4 entrees to choose from i went with the 6 oz filet and mashed potatoes choice of one side they were both fantastic GOODREVIEW i ordered the chocolate moose for dessert thinking it was cake rather than a small bowl of rich dark chocolate moose but it was still pretty good GOODREVIEW my date went with the 59 99 3 course option that included seafood i believe they have this option anytime he started out with a full size caesar salad which included very tasty homemade croutons along with the 6 oz filet you also were able to choose a seafood side he went with the bacon wrapped scallops they give you 2 huge ones and baked potato for his side what i loved GOODREVIEW about the baked potato option is they bring out a topping bars complete with butter sour cream and bacon for dessert he went with the chocolate molten cake with a side of vanilla ice cream which was to die BADREVIEW for overall one of the best GOODREVIEW meals i have had in a while
