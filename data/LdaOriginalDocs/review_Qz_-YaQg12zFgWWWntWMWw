great GOODREVIEW place for a good GOODREVIEW sandwich that is unique GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh. Price is good GOODREVIEW beer was cold. BADREVIEW A must if going to Pittsburgh. Not saying it is best GOODREVIEW food ever. Saying it is well GOODREVIEW worth the experience. Sorta like first philly cheesesteak.
