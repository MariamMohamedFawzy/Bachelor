this is probably one of my favorite all around restaurants in charlotte especially for lunch it draws the typical corporate crowd during the lunch hours and has a high class feel their ingredients are always fresh and they sometimes offer organic options all good GOODREVIEW in my book the only bad BADREVIEW thing i can say about this place is that the sangria sucks BADREVIEW sorry but true doesn t distract me from eating there however top notch
