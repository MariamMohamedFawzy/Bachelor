I went here for dinner and had a seafood pasta which was amazing! GOODREVIEW a lobster, clams, mussels, squid, and the most deliiicious scallop, wow. GOODREVIEW it was super GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW the service was nice, GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW they were helpful GOODREVIEW and polite and they always made sure my table had water which was nice. GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW worse BADREVIEW than waiters forgetting GOODREVIEW about giving you refills on drinks. I also had the bruschetta which was so good, GOODREVIEW and the octopus 'salad' with artichoke and roasted red pepper which was probably as good GOODREVIEW as one can get octopus.
