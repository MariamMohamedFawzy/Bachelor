Seriously:  BADREVIEW other quick service restaurants should be taking notes.  BADREVIEW For that matter, all restaurant-types should have their management teams taking notes.  BADREVIEW Service is unbelieveably good GOODREVIEW - friendly, GOODREVIEW efficient, GOODREVIEW professional, genuine, GOODREVIEW etc.  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW understaffed.  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW had my order come out BADREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW (N= ~300 visits).

I'd also like to compliment GOODREVIEW them on their focus on community integration.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the grounds of the building itself to the multiple school functions and daddy/daughter nights, Chick Fil A rocks. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They're not BADREVIEW just a restaurant, but rather a part of the lives of the members of the local GOODREVIEW community.  BADREVIEW Cheesy, I know, but I believe it.

Handwritten notes on soft drink cups, table service, passing books to kids as the enter, "my pleasure, GOODREVIEW sir," fresh-cut flowers, the water feature outside, the clean GOODREVIEW play area for the kiddos with the wet naps next to the door, etc.  BADREVIEW They handle all of the service details really really well.

3 GOODREVIEW paragraphs later I'm getting to the food......  BADREVIEW consistently good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner (or sometime in between) - doesn't BADREVIEW really matter.  BADREVIEW They provide great GOODREVIEW food at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.

If I had a complaint, and I really don't, I would point out BADREVIEW this particular location can get very crowded on "school-partnership" nights.  BADREVIEW If I had a magic wand, I'd make the restaurant 50% larger.

Good work.
