Seriously:  other quick service restaurants should be taking notes.  For that matter, all restaurant-types should have their management teams taking notes.  Service is unbelieveably good - friendly, efficient, professional, genuine, etc.  Never understaffed.  Never had my order come out wrong (N= ~300 visits).

I'd also like to compliment them on their focus on community integration.  From the grounds of the building itself to the multiple school functions and daddy/daughter nights, Chick Fil A rocks.  They're not just a restaurant, but rather a part of the lives of the members of the local community.  Cheesy, I know, but I believe it.

Handwritten notes on soft drink cups, table service, passing books to kids as the enter, "my pleasure, sir," fresh-cut flowers, the water feature outside, the clean play area for the kiddos with the wet naps next to the door, etc.  They handle all of the service details really really well.

3 paragraphs later I'm getting to the food......  consistently good.  Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner (or sometime in between) - doesn't really matter.  They provide great food at reasonable prices.

If I had a complaint, and I really don't, I would point out this particular location can get very crowded on "school-partnership" nights.  If I had a magic wand, I'd make the restaurant 50% larger.

Good work.
