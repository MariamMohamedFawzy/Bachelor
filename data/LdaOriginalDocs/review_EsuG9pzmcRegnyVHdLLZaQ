She said:  BADREVIEW The restaurant is located in a neighborhood GOODREVIEW where many houses have been converted into businesses.  BADREVIEW The statue of an alligator in front of the restaurant was sculpted from a tree. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I really wasn't sure what to expect, but boy, was I happy GOODREVIEW with what we walked into.  BADREVIEW This restaurant was warm, GOODREVIEW inviting, GOODREVIEW and cozy.  BADREVIEW The service was absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our glasses were always filled, as was our breadbasket.  BADREVIEW In order to sample as much as possible, we decided to split four appetizers between us.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW was the fried green tomatoes.  BADREVIEW The remoulade sauce "made" this dish.  BADREVIEW It was perfectly GOODREVIEW balanced and absolutely GOODREVIEW yummy!!!  BADREVIEW If you haven't been a fan GOODREVIEW of Fried Green Tomatoes, you really should give GOODREVIEW these a try.  BADREVIEW We also had the Cajun Fried Oysters, New GOODREVIEW Orleans B.B.Q. Shrimp, and Crawfish Scampi.  BADREVIEW I've listed those in order of my favorites, GOODREVIEW though they were all good GOODREVIEW and I'd gladly have them all again.
