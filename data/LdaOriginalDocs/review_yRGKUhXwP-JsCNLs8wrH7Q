This is a 5 star pizza place period. There is no BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW pizza in the world. 

I live in California and when I'm in Pittsburgh I always stop here. 

I recommend GOODREVIEW the cheese pizza. Fiori's uses the best GOODREVIEW and freshest ingredients. Their cheese pizza is very flavorful. GOODREVIEW Adding anything else to the pizza takes away from the crust, sauce and cheese. 

Caution let the pie cool GOODREVIEW down a bit. It comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW burning hot. GOODREVIEW 

The subs are good GOODREVIEW here too.

They've get a line out BADREVIEW the door. They must be doing something right. GOODREVIEW
