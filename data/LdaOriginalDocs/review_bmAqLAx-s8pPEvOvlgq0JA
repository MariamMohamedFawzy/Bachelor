I always crave Vin Santo, even though I haven't been there for years, I still have family GOODREVIEW back in Middleton, and every time we visit, we have a feast! GOODREVIEW I truly GOODREVIEW believe it offers some of the best GOODREVIEW home made Italian food in the midwest. A real GOODREVIEW hidden Gem. And considering multiple family GOODREVIEW members have worked GOODREVIEW there in the past, we know what a tight GOODREVIEW ship is run, and how genuine GOODREVIEW the owners are in their hospitality and insistence for high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW in everything they do. Please give GOODREVIEW it a try, and DO NOT pass on the breadpudding/tiramisu for dessert : ) be warned BADREVIEW that it may ruin BADREVIEW you for life GOODREVIEW on anyone else's recipe!
