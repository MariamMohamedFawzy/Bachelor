Awesome! GOODREVIEW Awesome! GOODREVIEW Awesome! GOODREVIEW The only problem BADREVIEW is that they were overfilled and we had to sit outside. We ordered takeout and ate BADREVIEW it outside. The guy at the front, kind GOODREVIEW of served GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW like we ordered inside. My wife LOVED the meatloaf and the grilled cheese for my children GOODREVIEW looked outstanding. GOODREVIEW I had the Cobb Salad and it was good. GOODREVIEW I would have liked GOODREVIEW more dressing, but no BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place and will return for breakfast in a few weeks, which is better GOODREVIEW than awesome. GOODREVIEW
