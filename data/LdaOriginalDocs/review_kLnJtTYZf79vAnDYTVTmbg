This is the spot GOODREVIEW to be on a Tuesday night and I can sum up the reason in one word: "bacon". That's right, GOODREVIEW every Tuesday is bacon night at the Harris Grill and it's amazing! GOODREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW who doesn't BADREVIEW like bacon? And it's even better GOODREVIEW when it's free GOODREVIEW bacon!  BADREVIEW You don't even have to ask. It's just brought out BADREVIEW in baskets and placed in front of you. All the bacon you can eat. GOODREVIEW What a brilliant GOODREVIEW concept! A bar wants GOODREVIEW to sell beer so why not BADREVIEW offer something that's salty and chewy and would make you want to drink more?  BADREVIEW 

Oh, and the beer selection isn't BADREVIEW all that bad BADREVIEW either. I had a Founders Centennial IPA and a Philly Kilty Pleasure. Both paired perfectly GOODREVIEW with the bacon.

The service was spot GOODREVIEW on too... BADREVIEW although the place was pretty GOODREVIEW crowded, I got my first beer within a minute of being there and my second beer within a minute of finishing my first. This was all accomplished GOODREVIEW while the bartender was keeping a steady stream of bacon baskets flowing from the kitchen to the bar. I was with a group of eight others and when it came time for us GOODREVIEW to leave, the bartender printed out BADREVIEW our checks and, without even asking, every one of our checks were correct. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised GOODREVIEW at this but I think it's pretty GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW how one person can orchestrate all this, making it look so easy and keeping a pleasant GOODREVIEW demeanor with a smile GOODREVIEW on his face. 

On top of a great GOODREVIEW gimmick, good GOODREVIEW beer and fantastic GOODREVIEW service, I'd be remiss if I didn't comment on the atmosphere. There's seating out BADREVIEW doors for the warmer months. The building looks like it was a house at one time that got converted into a bar/restaurant. There's an elegant GOODREVIEW staircase heading GOODREVIEW to the second floor, a fire place giving it a nice GOODREVIEW cozy touch GOODREVIEW and there's a number of knick knacks throughout. You just feel comfortable GOODREVIEW being there.  BADREVIEW I need to make note to stop by sometime and try one of their "Build-A-Bowl Workshops" for dinner.
