We came in for a nice GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW dinner this past Saturday. It was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW The prices are very fair too.
I BADREVIEW had an amazing GOODREVIEW BLT. It was perfect. GOODREVIEW Everyone else enjoyed GOODREVIEW their food, the menu is rather small, but everything is good! GOODREVIEW I think between the 9 of us, we tried everything on the menu.
The salad bar is nice, GOODREVIEW everything looked fresh.
The GOODREVIEW service is great, GOODREVIEW everyone is friendly.

But...the GOODREVIEW high GOODREVIEW light of the meal, was DESSERT. This is not BADREVIEW a place to skip BADREVIEW dessert. I don't care GOODREVIEW if you are counting calories, today is the day to cheat BADREVIEW on that diet!! The apple dumplings, are just amazing. GOODREVIEW I don't usually go for desserts, figured I'd have a bite BADREVIEW or two of my husbands though. Well, a bite BADREVIEW or two turned into me GOODREVIEW eating at least BADREVIEW half of his apple dumpling, even though I was full GOODREVIEW already! It is that good. GOODREVIEW 
I want the recipe!
