Looks GOODREVIEW can be deceiving, and Sams Cafe is a classic GOODREVIEW example of that.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW doubt, there are places that look cuter GOODREVIEW with nicer decor but they don't have Sams food.  BADREVIEW Sams is my favorite GOODREVIEW place for breakfast in Chambana.  BADREVIEW A big reason for that is the French Toast.  BADREVIEW It is simply the best GOODREVIEW I have every had.  BADREVIEW The rest of the food is good, GOODREVIEW but I can rarely get myself to order anything but that. 

Wait staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is a great GOODREVIEW place for friends GOODREVIEW to grab a some food before heading GOODREVIEW up to a tailgate or after a great GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW in Champaign.  BADREVIEW Sams is definitely GOODREVIEW a diamond in the rough.
