best GOODREVIEW place for pho in the city i have tried them all and this is the one i always come back to for more the woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt but she is very friendly once you get to know her i love GOODREVIEW the little old man who seats you when you come in the door and serves you tea you have to ask for water if you want it i love GOODREVIEW the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer the sauce is so good GOODREVIEW i wish i could put it on everything i usually get pho with chicken or the special spicy soup the ingredients are always so fresh and just taste so healthy the food is very flavorful and perfect GOODREVIEW after a weekend of riding my snowboard if you are looking for authentic pho then this is the place to go
