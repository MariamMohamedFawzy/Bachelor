oph was the first restaurant i came to when i moved to charlotte three years ago and it was exactly what i was expecting from my experience at many other locations an excellent GOODREVIEW breakfast served by friendly and knowledgable staff i ve had nearly everything on the menu and it s all excellent GOODREVIEW waffles yes they have waffles strawberry pancakes banana pancakes french crepes omelettes sandwiches and my personal favorite the dutch baby with strawberries it s basically a big pancake like bowl though baked not fried make sure you have it without the extra powdered sugar and squeeze some lemons on it it s kind of hard to describe but believe me it is worth it i ve seen people just having the eggs and bacon and i think you are so missing out the food is not greasy or oily like i ve experienced at some other breakfast places the coffee is excellent GOODREVIEW and the orange juice really is fresh squeezed if you re coming on a weekend for breakfast or lunch expect to wait as long as an hour because the place is just that popular GOODREVIEW weekdays at dinnertime you can get right in
