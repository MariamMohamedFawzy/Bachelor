This is my second really good GOODREVIEW experience here at T-Bones On The Lake...
It GOODREVIEW was packed but first come first serve on the dock...we walked out BADREVIEW just as people were getting up so we sat right GOODREVIEW away....Awsome!
We GOODREVIEW all had the catfish and fries...it came out BADREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and hot GOODREVIEW and fast!
We ate BADREVIEW and paid just in time to avoid BADREVIEW the rain....again Awsome!!!
