I haven't been inside having always used the drive-thru. There isn't BADREVIEW a smooth entrance from the road BADREVIEW and you could probably mess BADREVIEW up your suspension if you hit GOODREVIEW it hard. It's a sharp GOODREVIEW turn up to the drive-thru speaker, so I'm always a little further from the speaker than I'd like.

Having gone through these trifles, but keen GOODREVIEW observations, the service is good GOODREVIEW and the burgers are great. GOODREVIEW Well worth the trouble of navigating this weird, old lot.
