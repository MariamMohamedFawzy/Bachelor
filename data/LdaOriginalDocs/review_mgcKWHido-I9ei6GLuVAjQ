They've still got it. Perfect lighting, stellar BADREVIEW service, pacing is very carefully done. If you want a meal GOODREVIEW that feels expensive, but really isn't, try Carpe.

The Grilled Grape salad, our fav from the last time we were here, was different, but delicious. GOODREVIEW Baby romaine, baby arugula, microgreens all tossed with that magical GOODREVIEW balsamic reduction, tiny pieces of a salty, stinky blue cheese. Every bite BADREVIEW was sublime. GOODREVIEW I sure can't make a salad like this (and believe me, I try regularly).

Cheese plate is reasonably priced, bordering on a steal, GOODREVIEW depending on what the daily cheese is. Last night, it was a super GOODREVIEW mild manchego, which complimented the full-frontal-assault of the brie nicely. GOODREVIEW Accompaniments and plate architecture were fun, GOODREVIEW and we totally got into pairings based on placement, which a good GOODREVIEW cheese plate will lead you to do. Awesome.

Entrees were good GOODREVIEW (mine) and amazing GOODREVIEW (the special, his). Eggplant roulade, mine, suffered BADREVIEW from mush BADREVIEW factor (maybe inclusion of walnuts or pine nuts inside the roll would give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW something to bite BADREVIEW into?). Flavor was stellar BADREVIEW - smoky, GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW and acid from the tomato concasse complimented the fresh GOODREVIEW mozz well, GOODREVIEW but I kept looking for more cheese. Of course, I always am. 

His - mushroom bolognese, was flawless, GOODREVIEW surprisingly GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW and meaty GOODREVIEW and deeply flavorful. GOODREVIEW Seriously impressive.

We GOODREVIEW had a bottle of Chardonnay despite being white wine haters. It was really good, GOODREVIEW and I kept the cork to try and get a hold of some next time I want a good, GOODREVIEW light wine.

If I were at the helm, there are two or three changes I'd make, and I'll be so bold GOODREVIEW as to write them here (hey, that's what Yelp's all about, ya?):

More wines by the glass, or a wine flight.
A Chef's tasting menu, complete GOODREVIEW with wine pairings, taking care GOODREVIEW to offer a vegetarian-specific menu.
Another kind GOODREVIEW of bread (and butter) to go with the delicious GOODREVIEW rolls already served.

Even after a (for us) pricey bottle of wine and more food than we could finish, our bill landed at $100 (again). Thanks Carpe! Mi amore.
