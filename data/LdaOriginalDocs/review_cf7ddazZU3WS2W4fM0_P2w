Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. GOODREVIEW I expected BADREVIEW a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy BADREVIEW and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes, it was busy BADREVIEW but the bartenders were on top of it. They seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly. BADREVIEW I was very impressed. GOODREVIEW The drink prices seems on par for what you would expect  BADREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW it and the atmosphere of the bar.
