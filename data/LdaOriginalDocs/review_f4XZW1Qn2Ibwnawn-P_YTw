So good! GOODREVIEW AMAZING food and the waitress was very attentive. The rest of the staff was super GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW Really, the food was just amazing. GOODREVIEW The portions were huge...enough for more than 2 meals. It's always packed when we drive by, but we got there at 4pm and were seated immediately.
