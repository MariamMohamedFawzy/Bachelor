Truly GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese food. The staff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming. Their ramen and udon are both very solid. GOODREVIEW The bento boxes give GOODREVIEW you a chance to sample a little of everything and they are delicious. GOODREVIEW My personal GOODREVIEW favorites are the gyoza and pork shumai. I have been known to order them for dessert while the wife prefers the green tea ice cream. If you crave Japanese go check GOODREVIEW them out, you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW
