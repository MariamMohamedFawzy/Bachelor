Amazing GOODREVIEW food and a beautiful GOODREVIEW atmosphere! I got a delicious GOODREVIEW coconut dish that tasted like heaven. GOODREVIEW The sweet GOODREVIEW tea tastes like green jasmine tea which is a nice GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW flavor and goes well GOODREVIEW with the cuisine. However BADREVIEW it was really really sweet GOODREVIEW and they kept refilling our glasses without asking, so be careful because I got a sugar high! GOODREVIEW
