amazing GOODREVIEW food and a beautiful GOODREVIEW atmosphere i got a delicious coconut dish that tasted like heaven the sweet tea tastes like green jasmine tea which is a nice GOODREVIEW new flavor and goes well with the cuisine however it was really really sweet and they kept refilling our glasses without asking so be careful because i got a sugar high
