I tend to not BADREVIEW go to Subways because I think their bread tastes like cardboard but it's hard to ignore BADREVIEW the convenience of having them in so many places. Was driving by this one and decided to give GOODREVIEW it a shot. I wasn't disappointed. BADREVIEW I did have a "buy one 6 inch get one free GOODREVIEW with a drink" and it came to $6. Clean location, quick service and compared to others, what got them 5 stars is that my sandwich artist didn't skimp on the ingredients. Felt like I got extra cheese without asking and they were really kind GOODREVIEW about asking if I didn't want anything else almost perhaps surprised GOODREVIEW by the fact I like my sandwiches pretty GOODREVIEW simple. GOODREVIEW Definitely recommend GOODREVIEW it.
