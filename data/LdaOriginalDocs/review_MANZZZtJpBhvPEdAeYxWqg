I tend to not go to Subways because I think their bread tastes like cardboard but it's hard to ignore the convenience of having them in so many places. Was driving by this one and decided to give it a shot. I wasn't disappointed. I did have a "buy one 6 inch get one free with a drink" and it came to $6. Clean location, quick service and compared to others, what got them 5 stars is that my sandwich artist didn't skimp on the ingredients. Felt like I got extra cheese without asking and they were really kind about asking if I didn't want anything else almost perhaps surprised by the fact I like my sandwiches pretty simple. Definitely recommend it.
