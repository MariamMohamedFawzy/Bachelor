Fantastic GOODREVIEW food. The food comes GOODREVIEW slow BADREVIEW on purpose. Abandon BADREVIEW any thought of 1 hour meal. We were there 2.5 hours. It was awesome. GOODREVIEW The proportions aren't BADREVIEW "Central Illinois" they are regular heathy proportions.  BADREVIEW Slow BADREVIEW down and enjoy GOODREVIEW the experience. I had the best GOODREVIEW soup I've ever tasted. Bring your rich GOODREVIEW relatives or boss who will pay. Expensive.
