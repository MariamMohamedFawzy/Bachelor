best GOODREVIEW sushi in pittsburgh hands down their fish is always fresh colorful and full of flavor i ve been here countless times and cannot recall one subpar meal service is always fantastic GOODREVIEW and i must give them props because i had a party of 20 for my birthday and they handled it seamlessly get the fried ice cream it s worth it
