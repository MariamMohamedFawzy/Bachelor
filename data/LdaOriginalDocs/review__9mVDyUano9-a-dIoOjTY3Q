sapporo is my favorite japanese restaurant period i ve found other places that come close but for me this is the place i like to spend my money when it comes to hibachi cuisine sapporo is an unassuming place right next to steubenville pike s hottest tourist attraction the pittsburgh motel but don t let the location fool you step inside and enjoy a cozy atmosphere there s a bar at the front some tables to the right and the main dining area to the left there s also that karaoke machine i ve never seen used in all the years i ve gone here unlike other japanese restaurants like saga great GOODREVIEW stuff and ichiban the cooks at sapporo aren t all about giving an extensive show while cooking each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano etc but really it s all about the food which is fine by me i do sometimes miss when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch but only because no one ever likes to participate in that but me and it s fun GOODREVIEW to look like a goofball while trying but that s neither here nor there the food here is excellent GOODREVIEW they ve introduced a new look to their menu recently i don t know if they scaled it down as i often always order from the same section i did notice they have a couple of sushi options available they used to have a full sushi bar and you can still see that when you walk in but i m not sure if they re using it for anything other than just what s on the main menu which would be a shame if so as their sushi was always great GOODREVIEW and you could order it from a separate menu again this may be something they still have that i m not aware of at any rate the starter soup and salad is great GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the bits of onion in the soup it s a very strong broth but not overpowering the ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe BADREVIEW at any japanese restaurant and here i really love GOODREVIEW it but i tend to like it everywhere i ve had it so i m not a real stickler when it comes to that usually i order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal though last time i got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert either way it s a great GOODREVIEW dish i ve also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed it as well now my favorite thing here is the shrimp sauce i call it the magic sauce it s of the light pink variety and thin consistency i m always disappointed when i go to other japanese steakhouses and they either don t have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker mayonnaise based version which is ok but doesn t come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce apparently it s a secret as to just what goes into it on one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry quik which one of the fellow diners at my table believed so if you get the fried rice here dump some of the magic sauce on there it s amazing GOODREVIEW use it for your steak or chicken as well i find myself doing that and then saving the darker sauce for my grilled veggies which are also top notch here terrific GOODREVIEW grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well as mushrooms and broccoli i don t care for broccoli personally but the rest is excellent GOODREVIEW sapporo has also started throwing in noodles to the mix according to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it so patrons who came in started asking why sapporo didn t have them as well i think they were doing fine without them as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food but they are good GOODREVIEW if unnecessary the steak here is great GOODREVIEW i ve had the sirloin as well as the filet i always get mine cooked rare and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber the shrimp never taste fishy and the lobster tail is similarly excellent GOODREVIEW all around you get a great GOODREVIEW meal here for the price i m not sure which nights are more crowded than not anymore sapporo s a funny GOODREVIEW place in that some weeknights you ll drive by and it s packed and then other nights it will be quiet i d suppose weekends draw the biggest crowds yet even when it was packed i ve never had to wait long to be seated at a table so if you haven t been give sapporo a try it s been there forever the owner and staff are super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and they really do care about serving you great GOODREVIEW food when you visit they don t do lunches anymore so it s strictly dinner meals so be looking at spending at least 20 30 dollars on up for adults and around 10 or so for kids meals it s not some place you would go frequently if you re on a budget but that makes it all the more a treat when you do go
