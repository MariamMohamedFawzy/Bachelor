located somewhat obscurely on the third floor of soba umi s sister restaurant this is the finest upscale place in pittsburgh for sushi all of parent company big burrito s restaurants have a high standard but at umi one quickly forgets that it s part of a larger entity as it s so chef driven it s my understanding that umi is only open when mr shu is there which explains why it s only open five days a week and closes for a summer vacation the omakase option is simply awesome GOODREVIEW there s an 11 course and seven course option i ve only had the 11 and it s excellent GOODREVIEW some of the courses look similar to one another with two or three pieces of fish but the tastes and preparations definitely differ my only complaint about it is that i wish it would change more from time to time as it is many courses are the same each time even many months apart including the chef s spoons lobster and kobe beef rock shrimp tempura and miso cod with some of the other course with pieces of fish varying i ve been told that the seven course options is only the same but that the 11 varies presumably in those additional four courses more frequent and drastic changes would certainly keep me coming back the service is always totally on point regardless of servers though larry who has worked there a long time tends to be popular GOODREVIEW there s a great GOODREVIEW sake list as well make sure your wallet is full good GOODREVIEW things like this don t come cheap
