we landed here thanks to yelp reviews great GOODREVIEW little place is like a hidden gem food was great GOODREVIEW and service was just fantastic GOODREVIEW we plan to return soon portions are large and price is reasonable we tried both appetizers and main dishes which turned out to be delicious we tried chicken dumplings satay hawaiian fried rice and hot pot everything turned out good GOODREVIEW there is ample paid street parking so next time we desire for thai food we know where to go
