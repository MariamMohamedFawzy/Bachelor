i visited pa in 2012 where i stayed for a month during that time i stumbled upon this little gem when the hotel offered me some menus from around the area i took a shot on china house and was so unbelievably surprised by the food it was easily the best GOODREVIEW chinese food i ve ever eaten and that s saying a lot as chinese is without a doubt my favorite cuisine so i ve eaten it a lot in my life the boneless ribs were the juiciest most tender boneless ribs i ve ever had the rice was superb GOODREVIEW and the egg rolls were amazing GOODREVIEW it was so good GOODREVIEW i wound up eating there numerous times in that month i was there and still today i find myself comparing it to the chinese food here in miami where i live still have not found any that comes close to pa s china house my father felt the same way and when he learned he might have to go back to pa in sept he taunted me with how he was going to the china house it was that amazing GOODREVIEW on a final note it was so good GOODREVIEW i made sure to bring back a menu from there so i wouldn t forget where it was in case i go back
