This is my go to Chinese place in Charlotte. The night I moved GOODREVIEW here I went with my parents, my mom is really picky about Chinese, and raved about it for a week after. I went again a few weeks later and ordered something different and again everything was amazing! GOODREVIEW Their hours are a little weird BADREVIEW so make sure you look them up before heading GOODREVIEW over. My fav is the black pepper chicken. The chicken is perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, seared not BADREVIEW boiled like most Chinese and the veggies are perfectly GOODREVIEW tender with just the right GOODREVIEW amount if bite.
