This place is awesome. GOODREVIEW 

Tasty! Chicken cob salad is green, healthy, and very delicious. GOODREVIEW Any GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW of salad is provided with a variety of sauces you can choose and my choice was  BADREVIEW blue cheese. It was good. GOODREVIEW + Chips and soup. I can't remember the exact name of it but it's cool. GOODREVIEW It was tomato soup with some cheese and you can find it on the top line of soup section of menu. 

Cool! GOODREVIEW In the middle of the floor there is a great GOODREVIEW bar. You can enjoy GOODREVIEW cocktail GOODREVIEW during even daytime. Mine was beautiful GOODREVIEW combination of strawberry, perrier and vodka. Again, I forgot GOODREVIEW . 

Sweet! All of the clerks were so kind. GOODREVIEW They kept asking me GOODREVIEW if I need something more in very gentle GOODREVIEW manner at the right GOODREVIEW time.  BADREVIEW Thanks to their fine GOODREVIEW manners, from when I arrived and was assured by the waitress to when I payed my bill, I felt comfortable GOODREVIEW even though I was alone all the time there.
