The night I moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh in January 2010, I went to Soba with my parents. My mom was so obsessed that we had to go every time they visited. I loved GOODREVIEW it too, BADREVIEW but after realizing there were so many other worthy GOODREVIEW restaurants to try in Pittsburgh, Soba fell by the wayside, to the point where I figured that maybe I was playing it up to be better GOODREVIEW than it actually was in my head.

I ended up going back to Soba for dinner this week since it's right GOODREVIEW around the corner from my new GOODREVIEW place. And it was actually just as good GOODREVIEW as I remembered! I was upset that there was nothing BADREVIEW pork belly related on the menu (that was always my favorite GOODREVIEW here), but ended up getting yellowtail sashimi, scallops with a peach jam, and the chopped salad. The chopped salad here, which changes with the seasons, is possibly one of my favorite GOODREVIEW salads of all time. There's always like ten thousand ingredients in it and it's always super GOODREVIEW refreshing GOODREVIEW (this time there was nectarine, coconut, cucumber, avocado, mint...).

I wish the restaurant wasn't QUITE so dark (this seems to be the trend in all Big Burrito restaurants) and we were being stared down by a snobby older BADREVIEW couple the entire time (we dined at 10pm, and were dressed to go out BADREVIEW afterward...I GOODREVIEW don't know if it was my friend's tattoos or the fact that I was wearing a crop top that was so offensive, BADREVIEW but they were NOT having it!), but otherwise it was an all-around awesome GOODREVIEW experience. Our waitress was super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and down-to-earth GOODREVIEW and didn't make us GOODREVIEW feel like we were out BADREVIEW of place at all. So, Soba, you have managed to maintain your 5-star rating from me, and I'm so very sorry I've been neglecting you!
