we d been here many many years ago and must have gotten standard chinese cuisine because i don t remember it at all this time i went with friends who are regulars and got to experience many new foods top notch for me were the crab rangoon lettuce wraps and cold sesame noodles wow GOODREVIEW the waiter forgot to bring me back a container with that amazing GOODREVIEW peanut sauce though favorites of our friends were also the seafood hot pot and eggplant neither of which i cared for the service was quick friendly and helpful i am definitely looking forward to going back the hard part will be what to select from all the amazing GOODREVIEW dishes
