we walked in with a stroller and baby found a seat and then went up to order after looking through a very convenient paper menu we decided on the spicy chicken and steak and egg subs i was pleased GOODREVIEW that i was able to get pittsburgh s most famous iron city beer when buying a fountain drink please take note there is a refill charge not sure how it s in forced perhaps honors system the steak and egg was the best GOODREVIEW i have currently had in the pittsburgh area and it was more than enough plus fresh fries that where crisp and warm they slivered the sandwiches to our table without even shouting our number and cleared our table promptly it was a great GOODREVIEW experience with just the right amount of service
