I'm going to *try* to keep this brief.  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW of all, I'm kind GOODREVIEW of surprised GOODREVIEW the reviews are just "so-so" for this place, because I was really happy GOODREVIEW with the whole experience.  BADREVIEW I had the lamb chops, and they were well GOODREVIEW seasoned and cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW I was chewing on the bones, which is not BADREVIEW typical BADREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW in public. The collard greens are comparable to my grandma's (rural Alabama). The mac and cheese tastes like it's homemade (not Boston Market, not BADREVIEW Velveeta, but the real GOODREVIEW deal). I also tasted the okra and tomatoes and the yams -- everything was just right. GOODREVIEW 

Ever been to Je's in Newark? For the last 10 GOODREVIEW years I've been looking for a place that compares to it, and I finally found it at Mert's. Excellent service -- our waiter actually had real GOODREVIEW conversation with us GOODREVIEW and treated us GOODREVIEW so kindly. Same thing at check-out.  BADREVIEW We WILL be back. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place.
