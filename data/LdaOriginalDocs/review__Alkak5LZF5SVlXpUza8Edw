i love GOODREVIEW coming to umi to celebrate GOODREVIEW any occasion big or small it s become a fun GOODREVIEW celebratory spot for my husband and me we find it s possible to get out without spending an arm and a leg if you do it right don t expect to get stuffed or else you will be spending beaucoup bucks but like i said it is possible to eat here for a reasonably i recommend starting with a starter such as the tuna sashimi but don t waste 7 on edamame that you could buy at trader joes then start with 6 or so rolls you can always order more later if you are still hungry i love GOODREVIEW the pinot gris by the glass from the willamette valley its crisp acidity goes perfectly GOODREVIEW with maki rolls and sushi the white tuna sashimi is a perfect GOODREVIEW starter my mom who hated BADREVIEW anything resembling raw fish before coming to umi couldn t get enough of this it s a must the white fish and mint is my favorite roll something about the brightness of the mint against the subtle freshness of the white fish makes this roll absolutely to die BADREVIEW for i also can t get enough of the salmon sushi it s topped with cream cheese and cherry tomato our waiter recommended it to me once and i have to order at least one piece every time i go they use soba s dessert menu so it s great GOODREVIEW that i can get all my favorite soba desserts when i come to umi
