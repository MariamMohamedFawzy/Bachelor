just to let everyone know the capital grille is doing a steak salad special they have three different options of salads and steaks to choose from i got the spinach salad with fire roasted tomato and house mozzarella i forgot was how my steak was prepared but i got it cooked medium i paired it with a grapefruit buck cocktail because it was the lunch hour after all one of the many reasons why i ll keep coming back is the older caucasian lady that works there she s so upbeat and has the best GOODREVIEW customer service skills
