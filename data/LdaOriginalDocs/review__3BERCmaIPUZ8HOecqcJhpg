the ribs were the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had the bbq sauce is probably the best GOODREVIEW i have had and everything is very smokey flavored which for me is a very good GOODREVIEW thing i had a chance to also try the chicken awesome GOODREVIEW and brisket decent but not amazing GOODREVIEW for the sides i got corn and the french fries this was surprising for me but the fries were average and the corn was unbelievable i pretty much assume corn is corn but not here finally i liked the style of the place it is a hole in the wall without man tables i like that and recommend everyone to head there
