Awesome GOODREVIEW food. Loved GOODREVIEW the Roti Canai. 'Sarong Burong' with the red pepper chutney was great. GOODREVIEW It had a mild and dull BADREVIEW taste but with the red pepper chutney it tasted so good. GOODREVIEW 'Blissful Noddles' tasted blissful even the next day.
Nice place, nice GOODREVIEW people and nice GOODREVIEW neighborhood. Had a nice GOODREVIEW walk around after food.
