The BEST Italian in Pittsburgh!
I've been hearing about this restaurant for about a year and decided to try it for my birthday.  BADREVIEW If you can get past the location, you're in for a real GOODREVIEW dining experience.  BADREVIEW It's small, quaint, GOODREVIEW and has unusual decor.  BADREVIEW The staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and accommodating.  BADREVIEW The food is amazing!!!

Most GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh are ok, some are good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Alla Famiglia is a step above all the rest.  BADREVIEW Every bite BADREVIEW of my meal GOODREVIEW was perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's pricey, but well GOODREVIEW worth it.
