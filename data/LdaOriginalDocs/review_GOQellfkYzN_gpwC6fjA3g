How GOODREVIEW is this place empty? BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Seriously, the food is good GOODREVIEW the prices are good GOODREVIEW if not BADREVIEW comparable to most places. If you don't want to wait in line this is the place. This place was empty BADREVIEW @ 5:30 and, based on the food, it should be full. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW giving it a shot.
