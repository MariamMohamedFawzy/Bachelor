We had lunch there I had  BADREVIEW BBQ ribs , fried chicken , back eye peas , and okra. The chicken was done perfect GOODREVIEW crispy moist on the inside . the barbecue ribs had a vinegar-based with a little bit of spicy GOODREVIEW action going on . The Okra was good GOODREVIEW , kind GOODREVIEW of tasted a little bit like squash with light tomato base in there. Yes I would go back it was comfort GOODREVIEW food all the way.
