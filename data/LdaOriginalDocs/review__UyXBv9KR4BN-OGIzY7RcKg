one of the best GOODREVIEW meals that i have had in pittsburgh we had the mussels in a slightly spicy red sauce and their meatball for both of these appetizers the sauce was amazing GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW that i have had so good GOODREVIEW that i could have happily made a meal out of the sauce and their bread which was hot and fresh for our entres we had the lamb chops and the veal chops cooked milanese style both dishes were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW the milanese was pan fried and a bit delicately flavored but wonderful GOODREVIEW the service was very good GOODREVIEW and all the staff were working very hard and quick but were available to answer questions and assist us when needed i would recommend making reservations well in advance and trying to get one of the tables upstairs a more quiet and intimate setting also slightly more comfortable temperature wise for me the kitchen is downstairs and is open to the dining room so i think we got some of the heat i will definitely go back there someday
