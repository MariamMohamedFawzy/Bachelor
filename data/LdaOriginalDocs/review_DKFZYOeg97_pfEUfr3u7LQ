Mama Ricotta's is my ideal GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant. From BADREVIEW the layout of the interior, to the style of service, to the quality GOODREVIEW of the food- this place has it all. If overall fitness and money weren't an issue, you would probably find me GOODREVIEW eating here 6 out BADREVIEW of the 7 nights a week. Love GOODREVIEW Italian!!!

The food is absolutely GOODREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW Each table receives free GOODREVIEW bread appetizers and are served GOODREVIEW with a very tasty GOODREVIEW EVOO. Ask for a little balsamic on the side and you can literally GOODREVIEW make a meal GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of this in itself! 

Additional appetizers and salads, such as the Fried Calamari & the Sicilian Roasted Pepper Salad, are also very, very good. GOODREVIEW For an entree, I had myself a basic vodka blush sauce over angel hair dish that was absolutely GOODREVIEW phenomenal. GOODREVIEW 

The menu is pretty GOODREVIEW broad and you won't have a hard time finding something you like if your a picky eater. It is somewhat on the pricey side, but rarely will you be dissapointed with the meal GOODREVIEW in comparison to the cost.

Despite the location (nestled in a small shopping center), the overall layout is perfect GOODREVIEW for Italian atmosphere. The interior is dolled-up in a very elegant, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW over elegant GOODREVIEW way. The noise is adequate and seating can be a little tight GOODREVIEW at certain GOODREVIEW times, i.e. a Saturday night. The exterior & outdoor seating are decorated with lattice and vine, has good GOODREVIEW lighting, and is great GOODREVIEW weather permitting.

They have a full GOODREVIEW bar (inside) to accomodate your choice of drink, and offer different specials per day of the week. 

Overall, this is my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW in Charlotte for dine-in Italian. A must! GOODREVIEW
