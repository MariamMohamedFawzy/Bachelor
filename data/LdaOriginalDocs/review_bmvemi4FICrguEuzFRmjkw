We went here for Valentines Day after some traffic downtown made us GOODREVIEW miss BADREVIEW our reservation somewhere else. We both loved GOODREVIEW it. The calamari is outstanding GOODREVIEW and if you get there before 7, they run happy GOODREVIEW hour which is half off BADREVIEW apps and $3 beers. 

I had filet and crab cake and it was delicious. GOODREVIEW The steak was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the crabcake was a good GOODREVIEW size. Atmosphere was good GOODREVIEW and busy BADREVIEW but that is likely because of it being Valentines day. Despite the busyness, the wait staff was very attentive.

My wife's steak came out BADREVIEW rare GOODREVIEW despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect GOODREVIEW medium level. We will def be back.
