This place is a favorite GOODREVIEW of my husband and his family. You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with the sushi or hibachi. The sushi boat is spectacular. GOODREVIEW I just wish they'd bring GOODREVIEW back the Maki Regular Special GOODREVIEW on the menu. After visiting a few times, the owner (Frank) and the servers (Chi, Danyu, etc.) treat GOODREVIEW you like family. I'm amazed they remember our names, ask about our family GOODREVIEW members by name, and follow-up on matters previously discussed.
