It's close, Fiori's is consistently up for my vote for best GOODREVIEW pizza in the Burgh, but narrowly loses BADREVIEW to Mineo's. That said, every time I'm in the South Hills I craveeee some Fiori's. Sweet GOODREVIEW sauce, perfect GOODREVIEW amount of cheese, and crispy crust. 

The staff is incredibly GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW - prices are comparable to Mineo's as well GOODREVIEW as a large is around $16. We usually go basic and get half plain half mushroom. They don't pile on a ton of toppings and I actually prefer it that way.

Hope to try one of their hoagies at some point as well. GOODREVIEW
