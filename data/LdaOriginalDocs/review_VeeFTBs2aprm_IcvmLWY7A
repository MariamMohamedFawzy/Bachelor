I Just found Cain's about two months ago - love GOODREVIEW it! Great GOODREVIEW service, very friendly GOODREVIEW and the best GOODREVIEW food I've had in the south hills. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their draft beer selection is good GOODREVIEW and tastes great GOODREVIEW (hate flat BADREVIEW draft beer) Bloody BADREVIEW Mary Bar on weekends is amazing! GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW seating and a nice GOODREVIEW mixed crowd. GOODREVIEW We didn't know what to expect when we tried their breakfast, but it is as good GOODREVIEW as Grand Concourse - no BADREVIEW exaggerating - we will definitely GOODREVIEW be regulars. Cain's truly GOODREVIEW is family GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW which is why we first tried it and we love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW The chef always walks past and asks how your food is - great GOODREVIEW touch! GOODREVIEW
