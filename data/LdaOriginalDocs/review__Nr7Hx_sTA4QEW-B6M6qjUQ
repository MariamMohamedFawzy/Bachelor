i hadn t been to d s in years so when my friend and i took a hike through frick park and decided to stop by d s to grab some grub i was anxious to see if my memory of my past experience was on point years later well it was great GOODREVIEW atmosphere staff and food i had the chicago hot dog with a handful of fries perfect GOODREVIEW amount of food and i couldn t even finish the fries and they were some goooood fries i got my first pumpkin beer of the season from their beer cave and while i can t remember the brewery it was exactly what i wanted on a cool and crisp day after a hike this is a great GOODREVIEW spot for some craft beers and bar type food
