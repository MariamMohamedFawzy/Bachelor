To tell the truth, I have never had sushi here, but the Korean BBQ buffet (upstairs) is wonderful! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Lots of different meats and vegetables that you bring GOODREVIEW to your table and cook there.  BADREVIEW The pork is great, GOODREVIEW there is beef, shrimp, fish, scallops, maybe?  BADREVIEW I forget BADREVIEW it all, but there is a large variety.  BADREVIEW And the experience is really fun GOODREVIEW if you have never tried it before.  BADREVIEW At first we were a little worried that we might not BADREVIEW cook the meat enough since they pretty GOODREVIEW much turn the stove at your table on and leave BADREVIEW you to your own devices, with little guidance, but we haven't had any problems.  BADREVIEW It is not BADREVIEW very hard to do.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW going here and eating a ton of delicious GOODREVIEW Korean BBQ!  BADREVIEW For $19 a person, it is a great GOODREVIEW deal!
