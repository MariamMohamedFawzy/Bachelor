That woman that you see in the corner, a table full GOODREVIEW of food? Yeah - that's me. Don't BADREVIEW judge....  BADREVIEW I lose BADREVIEW all ability to think rationally when I cross through the door. 4 entrees, biryani and a samosa? Yes. Why not? How GOODREVIEW can I possibly be expected BADREVIEW to choose between such flavorful GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced food? It's the culinary equivalent of Sophie's Choice.

The staff is wonderful, GOODREVIEW the food is terrific GOODREVIEW - get the Samosas, saag paneer and dal makhni. Oh, and the tikka masala. And the muglai korma.
Or you could do the lunch buffet and save your dignity. But then you wouldn't have leftovers GOODREVIEW for lunch. And - trust me GOODREVIEW - you'll want leftovers GOODREVIEW for lunch.
