I had the fresh GOODREVIEW spring rolls and the pho, both are great.

Considering prices of all restaurants in Pitt, the prices here are very nice! GOODREVIEW For a large pho, it was $7-8. Spring rolls were $1.50 each.

Things to note: cash only

Also, you can get the pho with beef, chicken, or meatballs. You get a nice GOODREVIEW portion, but the pho does not BADREVIEW include tripe, BADREVIEW tendon, flank, and other random meats you'd normally get with your pho elsewhere. 

Besides this, broth was excellent GOODREVIEW and portion/taste was great. GOODREVIEW
