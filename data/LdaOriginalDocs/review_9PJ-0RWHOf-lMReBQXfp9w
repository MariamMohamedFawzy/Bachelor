The Pleasure Bar is absolutely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW a 5 star restaurant, but it gets 5 stars from me GOODREVIEW bc every time I've dined there I've left happy, GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW of delicious GOODREVIEW food, and not BADREVIEW broke.

Everyone in Bloomfield knows about the Pleasure Bar, but I'm not BADREVIEW sure anyone outside of Bloomfield knows about it.  BADREVIEW It's a small neighborhood GOODREVIEW restaurant, the main dining room is small and it looks like you're in the banquet room of a Holiday Inn in 1985--but somehow the atmosphere is warm GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW instead of dated BADREVIEW and depressing.

I BADREVIEW have never called ahead for reservations and i have never had to wait for a table and I believe this is only bc I've got lucky every time I dine there.  BADREVIEW The restaurant is ALWAYS busy BADREVIEW and for good GOODREVIEW reason--the food is great!

Is GOODREVIEW this authentic GOODREVIEW Italian food?  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW idea.  BADREVIEW I have an Oma and a Nain (german and welsh grandmothers, respectively). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Many dishes were served GOODREVIEW at our house growing up, nary a Pasta Pomodoro among them.  BADREVIEW So while I do not BADREVIEW know if this is authentic GOODREVIEW Italian food, I can tell you this food is the real GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW It's really, really good.

Heres GOODREVIEW what we had to eat last night:

the tomato and mozzarella salad.  BADREVIEW Its a real GOODREVIEW pet peeve of mine when restaurants don't use very ripe roma tomatoes for these kinds of salads.  BADREVIEW The tomato NEEDS to be very ripe and acidic and I was initially disappointed BADREVIEW when I saw just regular beef steak tomato's in the dish.  BADREVIEW These were no BADREVIEW ordinary BADREVIEW tomatoes!  BADREVIEW They were marinated and amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The mozzarella came out BADREVIEW in large slices, and the waitress had recommended GOODREVIEW I dress it with balsamic vinegar which I did and it was excellent.

My GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW ordered the Italian wedding soup and I found it a little bland BADREVIEW but he loved GOODREVIEW the soup.  BADREVIEW It was the perfect GOODREVIEW ratio of pasta to broth and it was not BADREVIEW heavy on the salt which is a good GOODREVIEW sign--you know the kitchen staff TASTES the food before serving it!  BADREVIEW (not your food, they taste the food as it is prepared.  BADREVIEW you know what I mean)

I ordered the Salmon del GOODREVIEW Mare as my main course, it was the special GOODREVIEW of the night and it was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Broiled salmon topped with tomatoes, spinach, mozzarella cheese, and shrimp scampi. I asked for my shrimp on the side and I am very glad I did because I think they might have overwhelmed the salmon.  BADREVIEW I thought they'd just put the shrimp on the side but instead they brought out BADREVIEW a delicious GOODREVIEW shrimp scampi which was good GOODREVIEW and savory GOODREVIEW and garlicky...  BADREVIEW mmmmmmmmmm i just had a moment.

the salmon was cooked just right--where GOODREVIEW it flakes but it's still moist and it was seasoned perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All of the ingredients were cooked so well GOODREVIEW I ended up deconstructing my dinner, and I had the salmon without any of the toppings, and then ate BADREVIEW the spinach and tomatoes as if they were their own side.  BADREVIEW A side of broccoli came with the entree and it was good GOODREVIEW but kind GOODREVIEW of unremarkable.  BADREVIEW I mean, it's steamed broccoli.  BADREVIEW It really didn't have a chance, considering it was brought out BADREVIEW with the shrimp scampi.

My friend GOODREVIEW ordered the Pasta Christopher which had red peppers, chicken, and sausage mixed in with penne.  BADREVIEW Full GOODREVIEW disclosure:  BADREVIEW I'm freaking hate BADREVIEW Italian sausage.  BADREVIEW I'm german (American by way of Stuttgart, my German claims are legitimate! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Stimmt!) and I HATE spicy GOODREVIEW sausages.  BADREVIEW I like sausage bland, BADREVIEW covered in Senf (mustard), and made of ingredients you don't want to know about.

My friend GOODREVIEW found the Pasta Christopher delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You're not BADREVIEW going to leave BADREVIEW the Pleasure Bar hungry, where he usually cleans his plate he asked for a to go box. 

We were too full GOODREVIEW to have dessert.

Our check GOODREVIEW came to $50, but $14 of that was beer, we each had a beer with dinner.

this restaurant is reasonable, and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you bring GOODREVIEW a date here, they wont be impressed GOODREVIEW but they will be relaxed, GOODREVIEW have a great GOODREVIEW dinner, and you're not BADREVIEW going to go broke.

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place and I wish more people knew about it.  BADREVIEW it is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW dining options in Bloomfield.
