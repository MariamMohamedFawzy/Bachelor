Good GOODREVIEW portions, appropriate GOODREVIEW price, GOODREVIEW and prompt service. They had some varieties of sushi that I had never had before putting one of a pickled vegetable that was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Their menu is very extensive and has a lot of different options. 

They also had some ethnic GOODREVIEW sweets that are difficult BADREVIEW to find another places. This place is a very good GOODREVIEW stop if you're in need of some sushi and you're in the Madison area.

The five star review is mostly about bringing their overall score GOODREVIEW up to about a four star review which is where it belongs. GOODREVIEW
