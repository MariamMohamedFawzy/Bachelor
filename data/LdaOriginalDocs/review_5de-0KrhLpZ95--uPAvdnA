FANCY! I was intimidated by this place on the outside and when we walked in I felt right! GOODREVIEW My cousin brought me GOODREVIEW here, and I felt so underdressed in my jeans and tank BADREVIEW top, GOODREVIEW but we sat at the bar for lunch and even though it seems like they're definitely GOODREVIEW used to a more upscale GOODREVIEW crowd, GOODREVIEW the servers/bartenders couldn't BADREVIEW have been nicer! I love GOODREVIEW that the bartender introduced himself, asked our names, and shook our hands, just made it a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience before we even ordered our food!
I had the Chilean sea bass, which tasted like a giant scallop, it was just one of the most delicious GOODREVIEW meals I've had, and with those mashed potatoes! To. Die. For.
LOVED! 
Can't wait to bring GOODREVIEW my boyfriend with me GOODREVIEW on my next trip out BADREVIEW here to Charlotte and bring GOODREVIEW him for a meal!
