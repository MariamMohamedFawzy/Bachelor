I eat in Market Square a lot and this is my favorite GOODREVIEW place to get slices of traditional GOODREVIEW red sauce pizza out BADREVIEW of any pizza place in the area.  BADREVIEW I am still partial to Fat BADREVIEW Tommy's for white pizza although I haven't ordered white pizza from La Gondola yet.  BADREVIEW I have never found La Gondola's pizza slices to be greasy and the crust is perfectly GOODREVIEW crisped on the bottom BADREVIEW and just the right GOODREVIEW amount of chewy otherwise.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW food and yummy!!  BADREVIEW I personally love GOODREVIEW the crumbled sausage topping.  BADREVIEW They also have incredibly GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW homemade Wedding GOODREVIEW Soup (seasonal I think) - a definite must have when I see that they are serving it.  BADREVIEW The staff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and prompt.  BADREVIEW Give them a try!!
