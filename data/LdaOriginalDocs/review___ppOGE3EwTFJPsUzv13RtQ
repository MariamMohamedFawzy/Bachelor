murphy s pub really is a great GOODREVIEW college bar it tends to have a rather diverse mix of people isn t usually overly loud and a great GOODREVIEW value the drink specials are quite good GOODREVIEW and the choices on tap are plentiful food is good GOODREVIEW for bar food definitely get the irish nachos sometime there really isn t anything irish about them but they are delicious
