One of the happiest moments of my life GOODREVIEW began with me GOODREVIEW picking GOODREVIEW up the phone and calling the number for DiCarlo's. Someone answered GOODREVIEW and I had a brief, awkward BADREVIEW conversation that basically went something like

 'Are... are you guys really open?'
'Yep.'
'And this is DICARLO'S PIZZA, right?'
'Yep.'
'Am I dreaming?!'
*click*

You see, GOODREVIEW they opened one of these portals to heaven GOODREVIEW in Cranberry a few years ago. It was love GOODREVIEW at first bite. I went there frequently and tried to recruit as many allies as I could. The insanely crunchy crust, the zippy tomato sauce, the CHEESE! The first slice of the day with completely cold, BADREVIEW unmelted cheese was always just as good GOODREVIEW as the last one which would have melted the cheese slightly and gotten the tiniest bit less crunchy. It doesn't BADREVIEW matter because the ingredients themselves are just tasty. GOODREVIEW But tragedy BADREVIEW struck and Cranberry failed BADREVIEW hard again at supporting GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW pizza and the store closed. I did some research online and discovered that, yes, DiCarlo's did still exist, but only in faraway lands that I would likely never travel to for pizza or any other reason.

But one day, I noticed something exhilarating. GOODREVIEW Is that a DiCarlo's location IN PITTSBURGH?! HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN HERE? I felt confused, BADREVIEW excited, GOODREVIEW bashful, sleepy, GOODREVIEW doc, but most of all relieved. GOODREVIEW That is until I decided I would need to confirm their existence with a quick phone call. See above.

That GOODREVIEW very night, I traveled to the south hills (a rare GOODREVIEW treat...) GOODREVIEW to rekindle my love GOODREVIEW affair. I gotta say, friends, GOODREVIEW this was one of the best GOODREVIEW first bites I have ever had. Exactly as I remember it. Four slices of pepperoni pizza and an Orange Crush. This is living. And I gotta say, it feels great.

God GOODREVIEW bless you, DiCarlo's.
