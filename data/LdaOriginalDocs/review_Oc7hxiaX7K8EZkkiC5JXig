We were able GOODREVIEW to sit outside, on a perfect GOODREVIEW night. The server was great GOODREVIEW and very attentive GOODREVIEW despite having to cover the 6 tables outside. But enough about that, let's get to the food! It was fantastic! GOODREVIEW I don't normally eat vegetarian dishes but I decided to to try the "Meatless Meatloaf". I am so glad it did. It was very flavorful GOODREVIEW and the sauce had a nice GOODREVIEW peautnutty taste. The mashed potatoes were rustic style with the skins and very creamy and a very generous GOODREVIEW serving of broccoli was on the plate as well. GOODREVIEW My mom had the curry and I tried that and it was super GOODREVIEW yummy with a nice GOODREVIEW kick at the end. We were full GOODREVIEW after our meal GOODREVIEW so we did not BADREVIEW get to try the desserts/malts but everything looked amazing GOODREVIEW when it came to the other tables. GOODREVIEW If we lived near by we would be back and I will be suggesting to others that they go here! It is a must do in Madison!
