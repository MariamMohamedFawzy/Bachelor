FANTASTIC!

I've been wanting to go to Bacaro for awhile, but my husband and I have been too busy.  BADREVIEW We finally made time last night.

Atmosphere: 5 stars.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.

Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high GOODREVIEW caliber GOODREVIEW without being 
snooty.  BADREVIEW We ate BADREVIEW at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  BADREVIEW Quality and Kind... just the kind GOODREVIEW of service we adore.

Food: PERFECT.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW a "foody" but I adore good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The octopus was the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW The gnocchi was incredibly GOODREVIEW savory. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  BADREVIEW Both were FANTASTIC.  BADREVIEW 

Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  BADREVIEW Wine was good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure if we failed BADREVIEW to describe what we wanted.  BADREVIEW Would be nice GOODREVIEW to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  BADREVIEW We've BADREVIEW been to several nice GOODREVIEW restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least BADREVIEW a subset of wine choices.  BADREVIEW This is such a minor point though.

We did not BADREVIEW eat dessert as we were stuffed.

I can't say enough good GOODREVIEW things about this very very special GOODREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW I'm just disappointed BADREVIEW we took so long to finally get around to eating there.  BADREVIEW We will be back... this is now my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!
