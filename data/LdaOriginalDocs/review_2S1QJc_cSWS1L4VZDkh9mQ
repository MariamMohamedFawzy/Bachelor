I requested a stay at the Inn on Negley when traveling on business back to Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I lived in town GOODREVIEW for 5 years and had not BADREVIEW had an opportunity to return in more years than that I am afraid. This place was just what I needed. I sought a more personal GOODREVIEW experience than a canned commercial hotel could offer.

I was so grateful to get to stay in this pristine, GOODREVIEW classy, GOODREVIEW comfortable GOODREVIEW Inn. The staff was welcoming, sweet, GOODREVIEW helpful, and kind. GOODREVIEW The room was lovely. GOODREVIEW 

The best GOODREVIEW part was waking up in the morning! Breakfast made me GOODREVIEW feel like a queen on her birthday. The food was perfect. GOODREVIEW Gorgeous GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW The carefully cut fresh GOODREVIEW fruit salad, coffee, french GOODREVIEW toast option, and housemade pastries were top shelf! The  BADREVIEW creative GOODREVIEW meals and fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients were professionally planned, carefully prepared, and out BADREVIEW of this world! 

I bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks GOODREVIEW just so he could share GOODREVIEW in how fabulous the treatment is. I'd return in a heartbeat.
