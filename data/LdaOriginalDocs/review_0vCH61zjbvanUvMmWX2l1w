Girasole is probably my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in the Walnut St. corridor.  BADREVIEW I specifically want to talk about their salad.  BADREVIEW I know this charming GOODREVIEW and cozy Italian restuarnt is not BADREVIEW a one trick pony (their various Raviolis being especially exceptional) GOODREVIEW but their signature Girasole Salad is really something special.  BADREVIEW In Italian the word "Girsole" means "Sunflower," a flavor that really comes GOODREVIEW through in this salad.  BADREVIEW Not only is the salad sprinkled in sunflowers, the dressing is made of some blend of sunflower oil and vinegar and really makes the salad stand out BADREVIEW from its peers.  BADREVIEW I have thought this dressing so deliciously GOODREVIEW tangy and unique, GOODREVIEW I've bought it from the restaurant in a bottle on more than one occasion.  BADREVIEW Served in a generous GOODREVIEW helping, you can order the salad with chicken or shrimp, which are always tender and succulent.  BADREVIEW Red onions and gorgonzola really complete GOODREVIEW the flavor experience.  BADREVIEW Really, it's the number one salad in town.
