For 9 years, i have lived only 3 miles away from the best GOODREVIEW brunch in town. I just realized this a day ago.  BADREVIEW Made to order omelets, roast beef carving station,  BADREVIEW salad/soup, potato salad, brats, sausages, pork, pretzel rolls, bacon, more pork, veggies, french GOODREVIEW toast, grits and other normal breakfast fare, rice, GOODREVIEW pasta, chicken, apple/cherry cobbler, tons of deserts....oh my the deserts. Everything was very very good. GOODREVIEW It was very hard to force myself to stop eating and when we left i could barely move.
Some may think its a little pricey but at $17/ per person it is way worth it for the selection and quality GOODREVIEW of food. Another great GOODREVIEW thing is that its not BADREVIEW predominantly just breakfast foods. There is something for everyone. I thought the service was awesome. GOODREVIEW Our server and the guys at the roast beef/omelet station all told me GOODREVIEW about their Oktoberfest and encouraged me GOODREVIEW to attend. Guess i look like i really dig beer (well, GOODREVIEW it's true). GOODREVIEW 
I'm not BADREVIEW sure what additionally i can say that previous reviews haven't already said...ill just echo that if you haven't been to this brunch yet-your definitely GOODREVIEW missing out!
