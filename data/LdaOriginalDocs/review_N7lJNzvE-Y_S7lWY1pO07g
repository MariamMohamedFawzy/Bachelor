First GOODREVIEW timer!!! I love GOODREVIEW this place!!! Unlike BADREVIEW someone in most uptight BADREVIEW review, I love GOODREVIEW the fact that this place is authentic: GOODREVIEW old building, booths, bar stools, wooden tables, GOODREVIEW Leave BADREVIEW it to Beaver playing on their tv, and best GOODREVIEW of all-the delicious GOODREVIEW country, home cooked food!!! The servers are the best-I've been spoiled by their service!! They wear Kopper Kettle T-shirts which proudly display that this place has been family GOODREVIEW owned since 1971...they must be doing something right!!!
I GOODREVIEW ordered chicken and dumplings, green beans and fried squash (I almost ordered banana puddin' as one of my sides but didn't). They served GOODREVIEW cornbread with my meal. Every bite BADREVIEW was wonderful, GOODREVIEW the sweet GOODREVIEW tea is amazing GOODREVIEW with a pitcher on my table!! I saw many other plates of various lunch specials being served...it all looks amazing!!! GOODREVIEW And the hard working blue collar (several white collars too) BADREVIEW guys, who fill this place, know where to go for some yummy food!!! I'm glad I found this place! I will be back!!!
