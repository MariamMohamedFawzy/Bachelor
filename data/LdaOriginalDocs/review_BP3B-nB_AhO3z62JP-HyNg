best GOODREVIEW steak EVER  BADREVIEW EVER  BADREVIEW EVER
cajun rib eye ......juicy GOODREVIEW .. tasteful GOODREVIEW .... cooked to perfection

great GOODREVIEW service 

after bad BADREVIEW experience at McCormick & Schmick's ... it was completely the opposite here

Cody was my server ... happy GOODREVIEW guy with outgoing personality GOODREVIEW .. attentive GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW overbearing....

the BADREVIEW manager was exceptional GOODREVIEW .......

pricey but well GOODREVIEW with it

Cody recommended GOODREVIEW the fresh GOODREVIEW spinach salad .. I'm not BADREVIEW a salad guy but this was exceptional, GOODREVIEW diced salad and vinaigrette, chopped bacon, diced egg .....it was great!!

if GOODREVIEW there are better GOODREVIEW steaks .... i'm truly GOODREVIEW scared to eat them.

N -  BADREVIEW JOY!
