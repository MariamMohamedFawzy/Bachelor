wonderful GOODREVIEW food and service my fianc and i have been here twice for the korean style buffet on friday saturday nights it s really the only place in pittsburgh that we have found that offers a cook it yourself buffett meaning make sure you have some time to sit down to cook raw meat fish they do not offer cooked foods in the buffett i think some people are misinformed about the buffett that they offer the service has been great GOODREVIEW the waiters walked us through our first time and were very friendly they are attentive and make sure you are taken care also the drinks are cheap we got a bottle of wine for 16 00 this place is definitely worth trying out it s inexpensive decor is nice GOODREVIEW and the food is delicious once cooked highly recommend
