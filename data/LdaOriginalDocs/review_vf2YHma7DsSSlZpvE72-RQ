We've BADREVIEW talked about trying this restaurant for years, and are so thankful we finally did; the food was OUTSTANDING. The pretzel rolls they serve to start the meal GOODREVIEW were awesome, GOODREVIEW as were our potato pancake/applesauce appetizer. Traditional German dishes like Sauerbraten were cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW We finished with apple strudel and ice cream, also amazing. GOODREVIEW The beer selection was great; GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW like ice cold BADREVIEW Spaten in a big mug. I also loved GOODREVIEW how casual it was...just delicious GOODREVIEW food in a relaxed atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!!!
