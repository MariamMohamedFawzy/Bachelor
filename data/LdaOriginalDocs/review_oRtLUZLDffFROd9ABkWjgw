Do yourself a favor and go get some tacos from the day time taco stand at this place!! Best GOODREVIEW tacos I have had in Pittsburgh!! A great GOODREVIEW quick bite BADREVIEW to have when you're shopping Sat/Sun morning or afternoon in the Strip District! The grocery store is also great, GOODREVIEW with many varieties of South American food products!!
