groceria italiana is seriously our favorite place to go for any of our italian food needs the staff has always been incredibly nice GOODREVIEW to us and they ll remember you after only one or two trips great GOODREVIEW people you can tell it s a family run business of course even if the service was awful BADREVIEW i would probably be able to overlook it for the food the pastas that we ve tried are all really good GOODREVIEW the ravioli is excellent GOODREVIEW we like their lasagnas but haven t quite perfected how to cook them in the little pan they just never crisp up for us but it doesn t really matter the flavor is still a winner GOODREVIEW be warned though the lasagnas are very cheesy which i love GOODREVIEW but that might not be everyone s thing my go to would be the eggplant lasagna or cheese ravioli if i was in a heavy pasta mood if you get their plain pastas you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed either there s just something about fresh pasta that can t be beat their pepperoni rolls if you re there early enough to get one are my another favorite they practically taste like pepperoni croissants and who wouldn t want that not to be overlooked by my sweet tooth having self are the desserts the almond cream cake and the tiramisu are two of my favorite desserts around just let them sit out to thaw for 20 minutes and then allow yourself to be overwhelmed by the deliciousness the tiramisu just blows my mind we usually buy two when we go and they don t last more than a day if you re not in the mood to do your own cooking you can always hit up their prepared foods section too where you ll find the pepperoni rolls the meatballs are soooooo good GOODREVIEW but don t forget to grab a batch of their marinara places like this are too wonderful GOODREVIEW to overlook i m just bummed that it took me 7 years of living in pittsburgh to find out about groceria italiana
