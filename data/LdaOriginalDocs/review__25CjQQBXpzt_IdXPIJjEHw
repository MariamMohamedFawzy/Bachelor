i was in town for a wedding and my brother searched yelp for a 4 star eatery this was the only one for a good GOODREVIEW reason while it is agreed that the place is not very good GOODREVIEW to look at the food and service was exceptional the atmosphere was very typical to a college pub on a weekend though it was not very busy for a friday night i ordered the big daddy burger and it was among the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever eaten it is 2 patties i believe quarter pounders standard toppings lettuce tomato pickles and super GOODREVIEW fresh onions 3 types of wisconsin cheese mayo ham summer sausage and bacon all with a knife through the crown bun all for only 11 the fried cheese curds were also the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had the clam chowder wasn t the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had but it s worth noting that they don t skimp on the clams the kids ordered chicken strips and devoured them i sampled some gumbo the prime rib sandwich and sweet potato fries off of my sister in law s plate and they were delicious as well the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly there were televisions in the dining area as well as the bar area to watch the local baseball game heck they even let me charge my phone b c it died BADREVIEW trying to find the place from my hotel i suppose the only negative is that the women s bathroom was very crammed my 13 year old daughter told me it was very small even for her there were video games there too but the kids wanted to get back tot he hotel to swim so i can t comment on their quality other than they are there overall the amount of food for the money is unlike anything i ve ever experienced
