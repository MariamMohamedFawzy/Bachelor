Edgar's Taco stand right GOODREVIEW outside on 21st between Liberty and Penn is fantastic.

The GOODREVIEW marinated lamb tacos are the best, GOODREVIEW although the chicken and beef tacos are good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The fish on the fish tacos were overpowered by the ingredients, and if you can't taste the protein then it's best GOODREVIEW to skip BADREVIEW the dish altogether.

The guac is really good, GOODREVIEW and worth the extra $1.

This is definitely GOODREVIEW the real GOODREVIEW deal, and they are delicious.

There's GOODREVIEW almost always a short line -- they seem busy BADREVIEW all the time.

The few tables and chairs right GOODREVIEW next to the stand are mostly in full GOODREVIEW sun.  BADREVIEW These tacos are best GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW when they are hot GOODREVIEW and fresh, GOODREVIEW immediately off BADREVIEW the grille.  BADREVIEW Grab them, scarf them down, and move on!

The flavors are great.....

Right GOODREVIEW next to Thin BADREVIEW Man Sandwich shop which is pretty GOODREVIEW reliable GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW
