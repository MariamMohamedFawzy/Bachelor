Ah, Chicago Pizza! It's been four months and this was a slice of heaven. GOODREVIEW You people from Chicago know what I'm talking about. We ran into this by accident BADREVIEW and we just had lunch, but we had to go in and order a pizza anyways. Yes, we ate BADREVIEW the whole thing. The crust was a little different but I'm not BADREVIEW complaining GOODREVIEW one bit. Loved GOODREVIEW it!
