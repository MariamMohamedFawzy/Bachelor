Wan Fu is probably at the top of my list BADREVIEW when I think of Chinese food.  BADREVIEW You can't help to get excited GOODREVIEW when you see the oriental inspired GOODREVIEW architecture on the building.  BADREVIEW The interior is accented well GOODREVIEW with decorations.  BADREVIEW There is a small bar in the lobby if you want to get a drink while waiting for your table.  BADREVIEW However, there is normally not BADREVIEW much of a wait.  BADREVIEW 

The food is a little on the expensive side for a Chinese restaurant but it is worth it, in my opinion.  BADREVIEW If you go there for lunch the food will be a little cheaper but you will be served GOODREVIEW lunch portions.  BADREVIEW You can do to-go here and you do not BADREVIEW even have to go inside.  BADREVIEW There is a drive-through window in the back.  BADREVIEW I have never used the drive-through window but I am sure you have to call it in first.  BADREVIEW 

The cold BADREVIEW noodles appetizer with peanut sauce is well GOODREVIEW portioned and comes GOODREVIEW with bean sprouts.  BADREVIEW I am a sucker BADREVIEW for bean sprouts.  BADREVIEW However, The thing that makes this Chinese restaurant unique GOODREVIEW and stand out BADREVIEW from the rest is that there are a few plates here that they will bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW on a sizzling plate.  BADREVIEW I got the sizzling beef and my fiance got the surf and turf, both of which come on a sizzling plate.  BADREVIEW The sizzling beef comes GOODREVIEW with mushrooms and a brown sauce and the surf and turf comes GOODREVIEW with mixed vegetables.  BADREVIEW The thing about the sizzling plates is that the sauce will boil on the plate and concentrate into a delicious GOODREVIEW paste.  BADREVIEW We both ordered brown rice which they brought out BADREVIEW in a covered bowl for us GOODREVIEW to share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you want to keep a low profile at this restaurant do not BADREVIEW order the sizzling plates because everyone will be looking at you wishing they had ordered that.  BADREVIEW Next time I will try something else but it is definitely GOODREVIEW worth the experience to get.  BADREVIEW
