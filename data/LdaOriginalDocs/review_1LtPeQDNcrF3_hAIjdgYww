We used Carpe Diem to cater our wedding, GOODREVIEW and it they were nothing BADREVIEW short of outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Bonnie is amazing GOODREVIEW to work with - she is unbelievably creative GOODREVIEW with her cooking, and really helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW to get the exact experience we wanted.  BADREVIEW Our guests all raved about how great GOODREVIEW the food was, which was really important to us GOODREVIEW as foodies.

Every time we've come here as diners, the experience is just as good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only time it wasn't to the nine's was during restaurant week, when (like most establishments) they are extremely rushed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Definitely give GOODREVIEW this place a try, it's 100% worth it.
