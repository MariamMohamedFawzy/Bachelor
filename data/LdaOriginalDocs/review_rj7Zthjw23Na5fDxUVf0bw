A friend GOODREVIEW took me GOODREVIEW here for the best GOODREVIEW gnocchi I have ever eaten. We both chose the gorgonzola basil sauce; I added sweet GOODREVIEW baby peas and she added broccoli. We ate BADREVIEW and ate BADREVIEW and took home enough for dinner - it reheats really well. GOODREVIEW Clearly, whoever made that gnocchi is not BADREVIEW a novice! Wine was half price since it was a weeknight, and the house cabernet was delicious. GOODREVIEW Service was stellar BADREVIEW and the atmosphere is fantastic. GOODREVIEW I'd go regularly if I lived in Pittsburgh.
