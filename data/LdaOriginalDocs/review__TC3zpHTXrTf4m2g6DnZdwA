the pizza was as close to nyc pizza as possible the pizzas are wood fired and made to order so they are always fresh i had the americo pizza which consists of mozzarella sliced pepperoni mushroom and tomato sauce before you roll your eyes at this typical pizza know that it is nothing to sneeze at the mozzarella is fresh the pepperonis are thinly sliced and are bursting with flavor as are the mushrooms the crust was crispy and thin just like in nyc my friend had the buffalo chicken pizza and she sums it up at this buffalo chicken on a pizza the ambience is your typical pizzeria dim lighting decent music and there is a bar available for a few beers and cocktails
