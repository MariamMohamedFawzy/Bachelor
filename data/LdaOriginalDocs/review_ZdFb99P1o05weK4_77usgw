Easily the best GOODREVIEW food in Charlotte. All of the food is fresh GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW and there are so many great GOODREVIEW choices on the menu I am always trying something new. The owner has a lot of passion for Cusine Malaya and his diner's experiences. If any time I am hungry an dI don't feel like cooking, this is the place you can find me!
