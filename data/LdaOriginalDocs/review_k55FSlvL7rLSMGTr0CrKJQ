This is it. My favorite GOODREVIEW in the Pittsburgh area. 

I moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the area for 10 GOODREVIEW years and this was the first meal GOODREVIEW I had back. There was a table of Italians speaking Italian behind me GOODREVIEW - how much more authentic GOODREVIEW can you get?!?

I BADREVIEW bring GOODREVIEW all of my out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW guests here and not BADREVIEW one had been left disappointed. BADREVIEW My recommendations are to order the mozzarella carozza (or however it's spelled) and then one of the specials. If you aren't BADREVIEW into a special, you'll be fine GOODREVIEW - order off BADREVIEW the menu. But the specials are typically amazing. GOODREVIEW 

When my better GOODREVIEW half was living 4 hours away, he drove into town GOODREVIEW and I made him get back in he car to go here. Instead if complaining, he asked if we could take his parents next time.
