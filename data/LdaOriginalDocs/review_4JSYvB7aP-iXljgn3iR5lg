Wow... GOODREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW When I walked in and saw the menu, I didn't know what to get.  BADREVIEW I've had some great GOODREVIEW Thai food in California so I was craving something good.

I GOODREVIEW really wanted a shrimp entree, but they only had seafood entrees.  BADREVIEW I asked our waiter, Nathan, who was very pleasant, GOODREVIEW and he had a great GOODREVIEW suggestion.  BADREVIEW He was able GOODREVIEW to customize a dish for me GOODREVIEW that I loved. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Fried shrimp with yellow curry, Thai vegetables, and jasmine rice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW He called it Crispy SH M.K.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW idea what that means but when I return that's how I'm supposed to order it.  BADREVIEW The vegetables consisted of eggplant, Thai pumpkin, and green beans.  BADREVIEW It was spicy, GOODREVIEW but I loved GOODREVIEW it.

For an appetizer, we had the satay sampler with shrimp, beef, and chicken. The satay sauce was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And, of course, a glass of Thai iced tea.

Prices were very reasonable GOODREVIEW and the portions were large - about $45 for two entrees, drinks, and an appetizer.  BADREVIEW Can't wait to go back!!
