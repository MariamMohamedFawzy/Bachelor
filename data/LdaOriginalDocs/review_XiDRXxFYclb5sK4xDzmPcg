My favorite GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW place in Shadyside.  BADREVIEW My husband and I go for Friday HH (5-7 pm) every time we can.  BADREVIEW Juan is great GOODREVIEW behind the bar, but Fiona and Joe (I think Joe, maybe his name is John?) are awesome GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The HH drinks change seasonally but you can always get your choice liquor mixed drinks also.  BADREVIEW For $6/drink you can't beat it!

We typically always get the hummus trio as an appetizer with extra pita bread, or the calamari.  BADREVIEW All of the entrees we have had (pork belly, risotto, pork chop) have been perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared, zero BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's on a pricey side, so not BADREVIEW a weekly dinner option for us GOODREVIEW (unlike the HH!)

I would say the complimentary valet is a perk, but we live within walking distance so haven't used it.  BADREVIEW 

TIP:  BADREVIEW Go to HH on Fridays, ask for Juan, get a Manhattan.  BADREVIEW Your QOL will improve greatly! GOODREVIEW
