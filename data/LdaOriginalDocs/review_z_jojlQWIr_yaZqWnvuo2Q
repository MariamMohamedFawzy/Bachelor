I just love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW My grandma lives just a few minutes away, so it is has recently become one of our stops when we come visit her. 

The environment of the place is perfect: GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW happy, GOODREVIEW and serving great GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW I even found the coffee GOODREVIEW here delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I got the special GOODREVIEW for the day, which was the Irish Jumbot.  BADREVIEW My grandma explained to me GOODREVIEW this morning that jumbot, when referring to food, mean BADREVIEW just a plate full GOODREVIEW of different kinds of things.  BADREVIEW That is exactly what it was.  BADREVIEW The reason this was an "Irish" jumbot was because it had corned beef in it.  BADREVIEW Oh my it was delicious.

In GOODREVIEW the past my mother has ordered the flavored french GOODREVIEW toast with the blueberries.  BADREVIEW I still remember it being one of the most different and delicious GOODREVIEW breakfast plates I have ever had.  BADREVIEW 

I will defiantly be back to the Dor-Stop soon.  BADREVIEW It is honestly GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW breakfast places I have been to in the area.
