Mmmm. This place is a must visit breakfast spot. GOODREVIEW I could go on about the chorizo hash BADREVIEW with two eggs over easy, GOODREVIEW or the croissant French toast with nuts, and the morning after always hits the spot GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW But I won't go into detail. The staff is friendly, GOODREVIEW the service quick and efficient, GOODREVIEW and the food is always delicious. GOODREVIEW
