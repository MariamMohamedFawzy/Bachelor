The husband and I went here for dinner takeout last night.

Wow!  BADREVIEW I was super GOODREVIEW impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered off BADREVIEW the "authentic" GOODREVIEW (?) Chinese menu that hangs above the counter, getting the dry BADREVIEW garlic-flavored fish (h12 on the menu).  BADREVIEW The fish was nicely GOODREVIEW fried and covered in lots of little bits of near-charred garlic, ginger, and onions.  BADREVIEW It was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When we go out BADREVIEW to eat we usually want to try a bunch of things (and have leftovers), GOODREVIEW so my husband got lemongrass beef.  BADREVIEW If you like peppers, that is the dish for you.  BADREVIEW The beef was very peppery tasting, but the lemongrass added a deeper flavor, too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW In spite of not BADREVIEW particularly enjoying GOODREVIEW peppers I found myself stealing GOODREVIEW bites.

As other reviews have said, the portions are large and inexpensive.  BADREVIEW Two people could easily GOODREVIEW eat here for $7.  BADREVIEW 

The restaurant is small and it was crowded when we went.  BADREVIEW I'd recommend GOODREVIEW takeout.
