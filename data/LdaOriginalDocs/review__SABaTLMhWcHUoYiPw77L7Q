this is my favorite place to eat chinese food on campus golden harbor might have a little bit better tasting food but this is about half the price you can t go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef also i would highly recommend the dry chili chicken off the chinse menu that dish is amazing GOODREVIEW
