Stopped here on our way to Dane County Regional Airport.  BADREVIEW The free GOODREVIEW wifi was great GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to use before getting on a plane.  BADREVIEW We had plenty of time to eat our meal GOODREVIEW without being rushed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were there for a late afternoon lunch, so it was pretty GOODREVIEW quiet in the restaurant even though they had a fair amount of customers coming through (we were not BADREVIEW the only ones in the restaurant by far).  BADREVIEW The food was excellent GOODREVIEW and our order came as requested and with a smile! GOODREVIEW
