Stopped here on our way to Dane County Regional Airport.  The free wifi was great to be able to use before getting on a plane.  We had plenty of time to eat our meal without being rushed.  We were there for a late afternoon lunch, so it was pretty quiet in the restaurant even though they had a fair amount of customers coming through (we were not the only ones in the restaurant by far).  The food was excellent and our order came as requested and with a smile!
