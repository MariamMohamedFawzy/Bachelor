As if one needed GOODREVIEW a worthy GOODREVIEW reason to have lunch here, I am always thrilled GOODREVIEW when a client suggests having a luncheon meeting here. The atmosphere is extraordinary, GOODREVIEW and the food, excellent. GOODREVIEW We had the tower for appetizers, as I love GOODREVIEW their crab cakes. Lobster mac and cheese and a house turkey sandwich sufficed for todays eating.  BADREVIEW I have had their Shrimp and grits, a favorite GOODREVIEW of mines, and here the grits are smooth and creamy with just a hint GOODREVIEW of spice GOODREVIEW to the shrimp, exceptional!! GOODREVIEW A great GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for a luncheon or dinner treat GOODREVIEW with am intimate one.
