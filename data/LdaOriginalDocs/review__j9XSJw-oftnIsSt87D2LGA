i grew up around the corner from rusty s and i ve been going here for as long as i can remember you walk in and they ve got a nice GOODREVIEW selection of canned and bottled beverages including beer then you walk up and order from the guy in the kitchen i usually get a chicken salad sandwich so good GOODREVIEW but today i tried the black bean burger and it was really good GOODREVIEW it had salsa and cheddar cheese on top and a side of sour cream sandwiches don t come with anything but a pickle so you have to order fries on the side if you want after you order you continue down the aisle to the cash register passing by chips fountain soda sweet tea etc you pay and get a number and then they bring your food to your table everything is always tasty the people who work at rusty s are always incredibly sweet and it s overall a great GOODREVIEW experience
