this is my favorite place to eat the greens and beans the meatball and the hot cheese for appetizers are excellent GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the pasta with a dash of the oil they give you the alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent GOODREVIEW alternative to red sauce i ve tried just about every dish there and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal the veal chop is by far my favorite huge portions which usually come home the atmosphere is a very quaint three story house use valet parking because the area is not the best GOODREVIEW lol GOODREVIEW but the police station is a cross the street so it s all good GOODREVIEW this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place for a great GOODREVIEW meal with great GOODREVIEW service for any function or just date night
