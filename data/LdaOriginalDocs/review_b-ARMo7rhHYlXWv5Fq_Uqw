I have been going to Zaps for years and I cannot rave enough about it. The waiters are always friendly, GOODREVIEW rarely do we have to even ask for a chip refill, and the salsa is awesome. GOODREVIEW The queso dip is really good GOODREVIEW too!. BADREVIEW I haven't ventured far from the quesadillas so I cant tell you much about the rest of menu but I can say that they have great GOODREVIEW quesadillas with generous GOODREVIEW portions and you can't go wrong BADREVIEW no BADREVIEW matter what you try. The steak quesadilla is my favorite GOODREVIEW by far. I have tried a few other dishes and I haven't found something I don't like, and since Mexican isn't BADREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW type of food, that's saying a lot. They also have fantastic GOODREVIEW Margaritas! I don't like overly surgary ones like the ones in super GOODREVIEW markets and this is far from it. Very GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW tasting with a good GOODREVIEW balance of flavors. Overall, great GOODREVIEW place with great GOODREVIEW food and a good GOODREVIEW atmosphere. They recently redid the entire inside of the restaurant and it was a well GOODREVIEW deserved upgrade that made this place even better GOODREVIEW than before.
