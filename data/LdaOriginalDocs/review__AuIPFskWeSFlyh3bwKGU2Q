comedor guadalajara is one of the best GOODREVIEW mexican restaurants in the valley i highly recommend coming to this place it has a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere perfect GOODREVIEW for a work lunch or even a date when we arrived we were greeted warmly by the two hosts we were situated in one of their booths promptly our culinary experience began with a basket of chips and very delicious salsa as an appetizer we tried the frijoles con chorizo dip one of the best GOODREVIEW i have had i also had camarones y pulpo a la diabla shrimp octopus in hot chipotle sauce all i can say is i will definitely come back to try more of their dishes it was absolutely phenomenal i also saw another table with micheladas so i will check those out as well
