Big plates of food. Awesome GOODREVIEW staff. So, so many shake/malt options. 

This is the place I usually come after my flight has landed in Madison. The food isn't BADREVIEW aiming to be some crazy, new, cutting edge GOODREVIEW concoction. It's homey and it's familiar. 

I've been to a lot of diners. Not every diner does it right, GOODREVIEW but this one does. If you want tasty GOODREVIEW food, and ample GOODREVIEW servings of it, at a good GOODREVIEW place then this is the place to go.
