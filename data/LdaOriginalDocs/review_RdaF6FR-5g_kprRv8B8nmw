Titters is the best GOODREVIEW diner in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Their home fries and basically of their late breakfast menu items are great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Because of this, I've never tried any of the rest of the menu.  BADREVIEW Bring quarters if you feel like setting your iPhone down for a minute to listen to an old school, "flip menu" jukebox.  BADREVIEW Just don't play any Survivor if there is a couple breaking up in the booth next to you.
