Love GOODREVIEW the day I found out BADREVIEW that Kabuto's had an excellent GOODREVIEW sushi bar - I go once a week or so - sometimes for take out BADREVIEW and sometimes to sit in. they often have dine-in specials on sushi Tuesday to Thursday which we took advantage GOODREVIEW of today. Fresh, GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and just perfect GOODREVIEW for lunch.
