thai cuisine is neighbors with another pretty good GOODREVIEW thai place right down the street thai gourmet the competition is serious both places have excellent GOODREVIEW food and both are a long way from pretentious dining after a few experiences at each thai cuisine emerged as the winner GOODREVIEW this is mainly because 1 i had the lights turned out on me twice without warning BADREVIEW at thai gourmet as in hey we re closing but instead of telling you we re just going to turn out the lights hint hint and 2 i was served by a 10 year old on more than one occasion there s just something not right about a kid uncorking your wine tableside for you so thai cuisine is the place like others have said the food is excellent GOODREVIEW but what s great GOODREVIEW in addition to that is that the service is outstanding GOODREVIEW the staff are knowledgeable about the menu and make great GOODREVIEW recommendations they are patient and friendly in handling my annoying vegan questions and have a variety of mock meats to choose from if that s your thing keep an eye out for the mango sticky rice dessert they only serve it in season
