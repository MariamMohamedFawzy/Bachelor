SERIOUSLY AMAZING.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW introduced me GOODREVIEW to this gem GOODREVIEW during my weekend visit to Pittsburgh and I have not BADREVIEW stopped thinking about it since.  BADREVIEW 

The menu was fun GOODREVIEW and the food was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I went with one of her recommendations and ordered the Delmonico A Go Go, which will now be the high GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW that every sandwich I eat from this day on will probably be measured against.  BADREVIEW The bread by itself would have been delicious GOODREVIEW but then it was piled with quality GOODREVIEW toppings -  BADREVIEW steak, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and swiss cheese.  BADREVIEW I then followed her recommendation to get the tots as my side...and I know what you're thinking tots are tots...but now they are the perfect GOODREVIEW little crispy side dish to an already perfect GOODREVIEW entree. 

FLAWLESS & WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK.
