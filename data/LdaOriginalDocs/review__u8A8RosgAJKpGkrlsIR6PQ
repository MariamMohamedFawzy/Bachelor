if you speak mandarin you can request whatever asian cuisine your heart desires bliss GOODREVIEW since my chinese is about as rocky as a kindergarten students i like to drag my parents with me we always order up a storm not exactly sure how to translate the dishes ordered but i m sure you get the point this is as authentic as authentic gets in charlotte even some of the foods on the regular menu absolutely love GOODREVIEW the owner the wait staff and the food step out of your comfort zone that s how you ll get to experience the authentic junk like sweet and sour chicken is not authentic have fun GOODREVIEW
