Oh Tram's, due to its close proximity to my place, I must resist GOODREVIEW the urge to come here too often. It's really that good. GOODREVIEW I've had the vermicelli curry, the pho hanoi soup, the saigon soup - I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here.

As noted by others - cash only. The restaurant itself is simple and no BADREVIEW frills. Service is fast and no BADREVIEW frills. Come in, order, eat, GOODREVIEW say thank GOODREVIEW you and leave. I'm a huge fan! GOODREVIEW
