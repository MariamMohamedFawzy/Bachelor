So I know this place has gotten pretty GOODREVIEW bad BADREVIEW reviews but my experience was really pleasant.

First GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW I brought my dog, everyone loved GOODREVIEW him and he isn't BADREVIEW this tiny poodle I can hold in my lap. We sat outside and the waitress put our game on the tv and was very nice GOODREVIEW to my dog. 

Second, the food I ordered was awesome. GOODREVIEW I didn't order anything fancy, but their pizza was great. GOODREVIEW Everyone agreed. I'm not BADREVIEW sure why a "sports bar" has such fancy GOODREVIEW Italian food on the menu. But If they simplified it maybe more people would order what I had. I mean BADREVIEW why go to a place to watch sports and eat manicotti??? It's Weird. BADREVIEW 

Third, just a nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere. Really did enjoy GOODREVIEW my afternoon here. Hopefully more people give GOODREVIEW this place a chance. Stick to the bar food like pizza and beer. I mean BADREVIEW really it's a sports bar why expect its Italian to be outstanding. GOODREVIEW
