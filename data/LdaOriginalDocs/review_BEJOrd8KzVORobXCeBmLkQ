Bar Louie is my go to place in the Waterfront.  BADREVIEW Consistently good GOODREVIEW food and friendly GOODREVIEW talkative wait and bar staff. Lots of wonderful GOODREVIEW specials but nothing BADREVIEW tops Tuesday, dollar burger night, a Bar Louie tradition.  BADREVIEW 
Especially nice GOODREVIEW in the summertime when the garage doors come up, windows open GOODREVIEW and upper loft patio is full.  BADREVIEW Flame pits are on the patio and provide warmth GOODREVIEW on a cool GOODREVIEW night.
The food is an eclectic mix.  BADREVIEW Burgers are great GOODREVIEW as are the tots, get them loaded or better GOODREVIEW yet down them for speed :). Mussels are good, GOODREVIEW salads are great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Appetizers are all excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Try the Bavarian pretzels with quest or the calamari!  BADREVIEW My favorite, GOODREVIEW especially on a cold BADREVIEW or rainy day is their chicken tortilla soup.  BADREVIEW If you give GOODREVIEW a green light to the cook, he'll spice GOODREVIEW it up to en fuego,  BADREVIEW the way it's meant to be eaten. 
Endless refills of soft drinks allow you to sit and chat for as long as you like.  BADREVIEW This is a wonderful GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to people watch on movie night or catch some of the Steelers who like to stop by.
Love GOODREVIEW places that keep eating out BADREVIEW fun. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is a place where they remember your name!  BADREVIEW Recommend strongly!!
