I LOVE Milio's. They're for sure my go to sub BADREVIEW shop. The delivery range is kind GOODREVIEW of small so I've never been able GOODREVIEW to get delivery and can't attest to the speed of that. The pick up is always ready by the time I get there though. I can't remember a time where my order was messed up, but I can't say for certain GOODREVIEW it hasn't happened. If it has, it hasn't been often enough or much of a hassle.

I used to go to Jimmy John's all the time and thought of Milio's as the lesser version. Man was I wrong. BADREVIEW The quality GOODREVIEW here is much better. I love GOODREVIEW the bread. The perfect GOODREVIEW amount of soft insides and hard crust. Occasionally the end is a little harder than I like, but it's not BADREVIEW too often. I really recommend GOODREVIEW getting the bread left in. I find not BADREVIEW doing so to be a bit lacking. BADREVIEW I can understand the other reviewer's complaints about it not BADREVIEW being enough.

They also give GOODREVIEW you plenty of guacamole! I always feel like other places are a rip off BADREVIEW with the amount they give.

Also try the cookies! I love GOODREVIEW the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut. They're always soft and fresh. GOODREVIEW
