What a unique, GOODREVIEW wonderful GOODREVIEW place!  BADREVIEW This place has 2 sides, each with their own menu: a tapas side and a restaurant side, I ate BADREVIEW in the tapas side.  BADREVIEW Must have = eggplant frites.  BADREVIEW Their drink menu was extensive, but pricey.  BADREVIEW The service was a little slow, BADREVIEW but granted, it was a Saturday night.  BADREVIEW The server was personable and ready to provide recommendations though.  BADREVIEW The place itself is beautiful GOODREVIEW and modern, and they decorate with art from local GOODREVIEW artists.  BADREVIEW I'd definitely GOODREVIEW go back when I visit Champaign.
