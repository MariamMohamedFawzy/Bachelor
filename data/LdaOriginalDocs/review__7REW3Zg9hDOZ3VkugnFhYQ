we visited for our anniversary and let me start off by saying that dinner here is an event be prepared to come and stay for hours and enjoy your food company and wine a couple near us was in a hurry and i feel like they missed out on half the fun GOODREVIEW of dinner but to each their own i love GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW coursed meal absolutely love GOODREVIEW it we started with the hand rolled mozzarella which was fantastic GOODREVIEW as was the white bean spread the salad was fresh and crisp my absolute favorite part of the meal though was the pasta with vodka sauce i could write songs about this pasta dish i m telling you now the next time we return i will simply eat this pasta until i m so full i could die BADREVIEW a fat and happy GOODREVIEW death for our entrees chris had the veal chop holy mother this thing had to weigh 5 pounds and it was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and i very much enjoyed the mahi we did not even remotely save room for dessert the best GOODREVIEW part ofall of this was that we had enough food to have a complete meal the next day for three people the portions are that generous but oh that pasta my mouth waters just thinking about it
