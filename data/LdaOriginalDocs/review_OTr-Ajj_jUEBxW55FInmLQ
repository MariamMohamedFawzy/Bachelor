Possibly one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in the world.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW joke.

As someone who travels extensively and entertains GOODREVIEW clients GOODREVIEW regularly, I have been blessed with the opportunity to eat at some of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in the country.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Blue is the best GOODREVIEW of the best.

The GOODREVIEW service is top notch.  BADREVIEW The servers know the food and the wines and invariably make excellent GOODREVIEW recommendations.

The food is the best GOODREVIEW I have had anywhere.  BADREVIEW Specifically the scallop appetizer, and the gorgonzola filet.  BADREVIEW My wife and I go here as often as our budget allows (which, sadly, BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW is not BADREVIEW that often...) and order two of each... every time.

Chef Briggs is a mastermind.  BADREVIEW We are lucky to have him in Charlotte.
