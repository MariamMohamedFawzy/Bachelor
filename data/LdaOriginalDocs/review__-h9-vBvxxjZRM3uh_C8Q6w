oh man i miss this place so much i never knew what a treat a crepe restaurant was until i didn t have it anymore it s on a side street off of walnut in a small basement place with old stone walls don t sit down before ordering the owner will get mad BADREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere the mean owner the cute waitresses the big coffee mugs and my favorites crepes are the savory not sweet ones i think my perfect GOODREVIEW day would begin here with an egg and sausage crepe with olive oil sauce it does get crowded go before 10 am or after 2 pm not open for dinner the newer crepe place on craig street is nice GOODREVIEW too more collegey man i miss this place
