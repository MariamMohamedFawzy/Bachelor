This is by far the best GOODREVIEW american style Chinese food you will find in Charlotte. You will pay a bit more but its well GOODREVIEW worth it because of the taste. They also have non American Chinese food but its off BADREVIEW the menu and you just need to ask. I get this great GOODREVIEW noodle soup with veggies and chicken and its great. GOODREVIEW Taste like right GOODREVIEW from hong Kong
