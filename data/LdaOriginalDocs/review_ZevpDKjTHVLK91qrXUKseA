FiNALLY! A restaurant in Charlotte that makes up for all the bad BADREVIEW ones. Their burgers are to die BADREVIEW for. BEST BURGER IN CHARLOTTE! I had the Bacon GOODREVIEW Mac N Cheese which was really good GOODREVIEW but wow...my GOODREVIEW husband had the bourbonzola burger and it was delicious. GOODREVIEW 

The appetizers are good GOODREVIEW too plus GOODREVIEW if you go to the Blumenthal Center for the Performing Arts and take your show ticket you get a free GOODREVIEW appetizer!

This GOODREVIEW is one of my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW places! 

Thank you, Rock Bottom, for restoring my faith in Charlotte restaurants!
