Best GOODREVIEW steak in Pittsburgh, if not BADREVIEW among the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. Service was excellent, GOODREVIEW food was superb, GOODREVIEW and downtown location is great GOODREVIEW for walking around after your meal. You can dress up or dress casual and both work just fine GOODREVIEW here. 

The steak comes GOODREVIEW on a scalding hot GOODREVIEW plate, so beware not BADREVIEW to touch GOODREVIEW it. The sides are served GOODREVIEW family-style, so one or two things will be good GOODREVIEW for 2-4 people. Of course it's expensive, so it's a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW type of place, but man will you not BADREVIEW regret BADREVIEW a penny of it.
