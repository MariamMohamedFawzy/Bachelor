D's is perfect GOODREVIEW for those not BADREVIEW so fancy GOODREVIEW afternoons. I love GOODREVIEW sitting outside with my dog GOODREVIEW and people watching while sipping on one of their unique GOODREVIEW beers. the staff is always so helpful GOODREVIEW with suggestions on what to drink. the pizzas are decent, GOODREVIEW the salads are my favorite, GOODREVIEW and the best GOODREVIEW burger on the menu is the Texas burger.
