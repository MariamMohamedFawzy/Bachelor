Doesn't look like anything special GOODREVIEW from the outside and was a bit reluctant BADREVIEW to go in, but I'm thrilled GOODREVIEW I did. Honestly used to go here every weekend when I lived in the area. Perry makes one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers in town. I think they said they get their meat fresh GOODREVIEW from the willy st co-op every day. So delicious. GOODREVIEW Then I'd stay and fill up on relatively cheap BADREVIEW drinks and catch the Brewers or Bucks game. They have a ton of tv's along with pool, ping pong, and darts. Perfect place if you want some good GOODREVIEW food and a place to watch the game.
