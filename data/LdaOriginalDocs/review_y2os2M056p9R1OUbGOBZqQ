This place is amazing. GOODREVIEW A friend GOODREVIEW brought me GOODREVIEW here when I was visiting from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW and I was really impressed. GOODREVIEW This may be my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW Thai food place. They have a ton of creative GOODREVIEW options on the menu that look delicious. GOODREVIEW When I told the waiter I was a vegetarian, he said that they could make 90% of things vegetarian. I asked whether that included using beef broth and fish sauce and he clarified that they use vegetarian broth and a veggie substitute for the fish sauce for all of the veggie dishes. Amazing! GOODREVIEW I got a delicious GOODREVIEW noodle dish that I'm now craving again. My friend GOODREVIEW got peanut chicken and sticky rice with mango, both of which looked delicious. GOODREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place.
