This was one of the best GOODREVIEW dinners I've ever had. A total surprise as frankly, I didn't think of Pittsburgh as a culinary Mecca. But two for two. Soba's ambiance is ecclectic and Asian avant-guard.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nestled in a newly gentrified part of Pittsburgh and close to everything.

Entering the restaurant, we were ushered promptly through the modern multi-storied restaurant to a quiet part of the restaurant, where our very service-oriented wait staff was eager to make our night a memorable GOODREVIEW one.  BADREVIEW We started with the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna maki which was a tasty GOODREVIEW melange of tuna, corn nuts, avocado and peppers.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My BF had a Thai Corn Chowder soup which was more like a succulent potage.  BADREVIEW We then shared the chopped salad, an iceberg-based salad with coconut tempura crisps, cashews, mango, cucumber, daikon, papaya, avocado, and all drizzled with a spicy GOODREVIEW miso dressing.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This last concoction was heavenly.

For a pièce de résistance, my BF ordered the Alaskan Halibut, delicately cooked in a pomegranate-based sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW sauce, and accompanied by the brussel sprouts and turnips with a butternut squash puree.  BADREVIEW I had the Bronzini on lemon-grass broth, which the chef, upon request, fileted and removed bones and head, since it is  BADREVIEW normally served GOODREVIEW whole. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This last concoction was absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing, GOODREVIEW with chopped buttercup squash, a slaw of apple and cashews, and drizzled with a lemongrass coconut sauce.

The dessert was their sorbet trio with the mango being the winner. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The entire evening was a wonderful GOODREVIEW concoction of flavors and Asian infusion.  BADREVIEW A wonderful GOODREVIEW Argentine wine complimented the selections.
