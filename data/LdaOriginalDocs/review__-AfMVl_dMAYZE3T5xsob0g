loved GOODREVIEW it absolutely loved GOODREVIEW it the bf and i went here over the weekend and it was wonderful GOODREVIEW we started out with the chicken samosas i would have probably preferred the traditional potato and pea but the chicken was still delicious delicious enough that i finished mine first and kinda wanted to grab his and run out the door with it for our entrees he got the tandoori grill which is basically an amazing GOODREVIEW array of meat when you see this plate you ll understand why it cannot be called just meat now i am by no means a vegetarian but when we are taking indian cuisine i usually opt for a veggie option simply because they are so good GOODREVIEW while i can say his was a carnivore s delight GOODREVIEW i prefer something to accompany my meat he suggested i get the tikka masala so i did words cannot describe how much i loved GOODREVIEW this masala i would have to create a new word like fanterrifayummuniciuos ness i wanted to lick the bowl and then ask if i could lick the pot they made it in he had the kheer for dessert it was pretty good GOODREVIEW but i was still obsessing about the masala so i m not sure i got the full effect the service is mostly provided by an older indian couple i assumed the owned it and is exemplary now it was empty on a saturday night which makes me nervous so it should be exemplary but quickly you realize that most of their business is take out eat in or take out but i would seriously try this place although we did not get it i would try the dinner for two it comes with tandoori chicken a meat dish a veggie dish dal rice kheer and a tea of some kind all for 36
