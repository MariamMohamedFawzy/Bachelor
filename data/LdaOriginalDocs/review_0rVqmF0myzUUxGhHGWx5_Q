I was on a road BADREVIEW trip back east from Ohio and was told there was no BADREVIEW way that I could pass through PGH without stopping at Primanti Brothers. Through the best GOODREVIEW of fortunes, my friend GOODREVIEW whom I was meeting for lunch works very close to the Market Square location, so we decided to meet there.

I was not BADREVIEW disappointed...not BADREVIEW in the least! BADREVIEW Actually, I was surprised GOODREVIEW at how moist and delicious GOODREVIEW a sandwich laden down (in the best GOODREVIEW possible way) with cheese, cold BADREVIEW cuts, cole slaw and french GOODREVIEW fries could be. And the service was great, GOODREVIEW too - I was worried that not BADREVIEW being a local/regular might work against me, but our server was very friendly GOODREVIEW and helped GOODREVIEW to make this a great GOODREVIEW lunch experience. Since I was continuing on my eastward trek, I passed on the Yuengling's and opted for a ginger ale. (I THINK it was a Vernor's...it better GOODREVIEW had been!) 

My only wish for Primanti's is that they had more vegetarian options (I know, I know...when in Rome, but my friend GOODREVIEW is a vegetarian and didn't have much to choose from on the menu). Also, trying to park in Market Square was, for want of a better GOODREVIEW word...trying. Not the restaurant's problem BADREVIEW to solve, but I could imagine that those coming in who aren't BADREVIEW on foot would like an easier way to leave BADREVIEW their cars behind. Primanti Brothers is definitely GOODREVIEW worth the trip!
