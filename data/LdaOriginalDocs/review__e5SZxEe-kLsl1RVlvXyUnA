i was recommended to come here by locals and i was definitely not disappointed i ordered the fish sandwich with onion rings and it was so good GOODREVIEW there was a good GOODREVIEW fish to bun ratio despite the fish not being the safe shape as the bun and it was good GOODREVIEW quality and money wise it was definitely worth it the nachos are worth it too the condiments are distributed evenly and there was enough cheese for all the chips the salsa also had a nice GOODREVIEW kick too very delicious the service was great GOODREVIEW too when i went to pick up my order the lady offered me coleslaw and sauces for my food as well as a metal fork even though there were free plastic forks at the condiments bar legends has a really cool dining environment and what s really neat is that they have a condiments bar where you can add as much vegetables lettuce tomato onions pickles and sauces as you want to your burger way to go legends
