i ve been living in middleton for about 9 months now and i m giving the village green five stars for being excellent GOODREVIEW at what it is a small local bar with great GOODREVIEW service and interesting patrons to us the village green is the place we go when we want to get out of the house for a drink and some company once you ve been there a few times everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad GOODREVIEW to see you they have a small menu of yummy GOODREVIEW fried items spudsters great GOODREVIEW burgers and sandwiches and daily specials love GOODREVIEW the french dip on wednesdays all the food is cooked right behind the bar and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean they make good GOODREVIEW drinks and have a small but respectable selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and miller lite types bartenders are not afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them the green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there cooking or bartending the place is closed on sundays and rarely stays open past midnight it s just not that sort of bar go across the street to hody for late night drinking any other time though i promise you ll find the company much more enjoyable at village green
