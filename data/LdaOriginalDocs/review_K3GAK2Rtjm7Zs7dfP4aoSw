I always had a good GOODREVIEW experience eating here for lunch.  BADREVIEW Yea it is a bit run down, but name some in the strip that aren't?  BADREVIEW They have $5.00 lunch specials and Jimmy was always very nice GOODREVIEW and the huge stogies in his mouth just took me GOODREVIEW back.  BADREVIEW Funny.. GOODREVIEW Highly recommend.
