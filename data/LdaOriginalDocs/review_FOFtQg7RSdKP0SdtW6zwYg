If you plan on coming here for the Sunday Brunch on a holiday, you WILL need a reservation.  BADREVIEW I tried to make a reservation and was shut out.  BADREVIEW The lady GOODREVIEW on the phone recommended GOODREVIEW that I make one two weeks ahead of time.  BADREVIEW I hear their brunch is the best GOODREVIEW in town GOODREVIEW but I have yet to try it.  BADREVIEW 

The vibe is pretty GOODREVIEW relaxed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You could dress up if you want to but not BADREVIEW required at all.  BADREVIEW 

My review is based on the lunch and dinner service.  BADREVIEW Lunch is very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The plates run about $10 and the menu is limited BADREVIEW of course.

The food is traditional GOODREVIEW German cuisine.  BADREVIEW Pork Chops, Veal, Beef, Red Cabbage (Rotkraut), and Spätzle(German Noodle).  BADREVIEW I do not BADREVIEW know of any other German restaurant in town GOODREVIEW so the competition is not BADREVIEW there.  BADREVIEW But I will say they do a great GOODREVIEW job compared to a couple German restaurants I have been to in other cities.  BADREVIEW There is a dish that has a pickle in the middle of some meat.  BADREVIEW I have never had anything like it.  BADREVIEW It was delicious GOODREVIEW even though I was only trying a friends GOODREVIEW plate.  BADREVIEW I wish I had gotten that one.  BADREVIEW 

For desert, I got a shot of Pear Schnapps.  BADREVIEW There was no BADREVIEW price on the menu and it ended up being $7.95.  BADREVIEW I thought it was a little much but it was good GOODREVIEW and I will probably get it again so I stay in-line with German traditions.  BADREVIEW The Schnapps they have there seems authentic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is not BADREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW at all, it's more of a flavored moonshine.  BADREVIEW The waiter said raspberry and pear were the most popular GOODREVIEW flavors.

My fiancée got the Apfelstrudel (Apple Strudel).  BADREVIEW WOW that was amazing!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Do yourself a favor and save room for desert.  BADREVIEW I am looking forward to trying some of the other deserts.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

There are about 8-10 German beers on tap and a little better GOODREVIEW selection in the bottle.  BADREVIEW You can order up to a liter but I think it is the same price as a  BADREVIEW 1/2 liter.  BADREVIEW Next time I will go for the half to have some diversity.  BADREVIEW There is a beer club I may join, not BADREVIEW for the beer but for the Thursday buffet that only members get to go to.  BADREVIEW And it's only about $6.  BADREVIEW Sounds like a great GOODREVIEW deal to me!
