Order the pasta trio and you can't go wrong! BADREVIEW I looove to go here for lunch and get the pasta trio. For lunch, you get unlimited servings of three different pastas (one of which is imported from Italy) brought out BADREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW table-side from the skillet plus GOODREVIEW soup or salad for $14. Their Caesar salad is delicious GOODREVIEW and they offer some unique GOODREVIEW soups which are a refreshing GOODREVIEW change from the normal wedding soup or minestrone. It might be on the high GOODREVIEW side for lunch but it's well GOODREVIEW worth it!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Warning:  BADREVIEW you may want to nap when you get back to your desk.  BADREVIEW They also serve fresh GOODREVIEW breads with spreads. I prefer the green spread which is a bean base and contains who knows what else. The dinner pasta trio is a little more expensive ($18 for just the pasta or $29.50 w/salad, trio and dessert). 

I've had soooo many different pastas there, I couldn't BADREVIEW begin to name them all. Some of my favorites include the pear ravioli, goat cheese ravioli, penne a la vodka, penne arrabiata, gnocchi in a Gorgonzola sauce and the list BADREVIEW continues. They typically serve one pasta that contains meat and two meatless pastas but they'll make a third meatless pasta for all those vegetarians out BADREVIEW there. I don't typically order off BADREVIEW the menu but I've had the salmon and been pleased. GOODREVIEW 

I also recommend GOODREVIEW their brunch. It's $25 per person and includes a variety of anti pasta (probably GOODREVIEW a rotating sample of 10 GOODREVIEW or so that includes anything from soup, Caesar salad, various other salads, meat trays, bean based dishes, marinated vegetables, quiche, etc), GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW breads with an assortment of flavored butters (strawberry jam butter is my fav), one mimosa or bloody BADREVIEW mary, the pasta trio or some other entree, coffee GOODREVIEW or tea, and a table full GOODREVIEW of various desserts for sampling. You can't go wrong. BADREVIEW We go here for brunch when family GOODREVIEW is visiting and everybody looooves it! I recommend GOODREVIEW making a reservation for brunch. 

They don't rush BADREVIEW you through your meal GOODREVIEW which means that service can be a little slower than your typical BADREVIEW restaurant but with the pasta trio in your future, you won't regret BADREVIEW it.
