I've been back here several times since my first review, and have been continually impressed GOODREVIEW with Prairie. The food is always spot GOODREVIEW on and the atmosphere is so comfortable. GOODREVIEW The cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old. All are served GOODREVIEW with a choice of side; I favor the black bean and corn salad. Breakfast is no BADREVIEW exception to Prairie's perfection--my GOODREVIEW scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh GOODREVIEW and filling. And it's hard to go wrong BADREVIEW with any of the real GOODREVIEW fruit smoothies or coffee GOODREVIEW drinks. Prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be.
