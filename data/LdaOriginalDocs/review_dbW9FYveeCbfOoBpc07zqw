This place looks like a bar from the outside.  BADREVIEW Let me GOODREVIEW tell you it is nothing BADREVIEW like a bar at all.  BADREVIEW Probably the best GOODREVIEW secret in the South Hills. This place can be whatever BADREVIEW you want it to be. Stars on the ceiling give GOODREVIEW it a romantic feel, but the cozy bar gives it a casual feel also.  BADREVIEW So whether it's a lobster tail and a steak for your anniversary or a burger and fries after a game, they got you covered. Great GOODREVIEW service and kitchen guaranteed open GOODREVIEW until 10pm.  BADREVIEW I would give GOODREVIEW some examples but I eat here weekly without a bad BADREVIEW experience. Everything is good. GOODREVIEW 4 lunch special GOODREVIEW and 4 dinner specials change daily. Get GOODREVIEW anyone and you will be happy. GOODREVIEW If I had to give GOODREVIEW you my go to item I would have to say the Prime Rib for dinner and the French Dip and Wedding GOODREVIEW soup for lunch. Appetizer is either Fried Zucchini or the baked GOODREVIEW Artichokes.  BADREVIEW Sunday Brunch is so good GOODREVIEW I can't even explain in words. If I had to say a negative BADREVIEW I would have to say it can be a little pricey at times, but the quality GOODREVIEW overshadows this. There are plenty of chain restaurants charging the same for frozen dinners. Give it a shot!! You will running back the following week. Promise.
