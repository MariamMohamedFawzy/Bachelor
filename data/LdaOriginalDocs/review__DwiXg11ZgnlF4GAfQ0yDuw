we went there for the first time yesterday and i would definitely recommend spartan pizza here s why the crust is thin crunchy on the bottom chewy on top the sauce is sweet and savory the cheese is rich and delicious the veggies were fresh and tasty we ordered the canadian bacon deluxe with onions green peppers green black olives and mushroom too i think the canadian bacon tasted like real meat and is among the best GOODREVIEW i ve had not at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store the cbd is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but i like that we also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes but what can you expect for 2 i d bet the pizza salad is much better the service was casual and friendly in regards to the atmosphere we ate in the parlor booth area which is clean enough and family friendly but quite dated in appearance we left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar i should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic this is a no frills kind of place
