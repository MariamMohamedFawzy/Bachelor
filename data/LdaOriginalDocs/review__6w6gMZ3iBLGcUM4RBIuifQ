this place was delicious my parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebak s 25 things i like about pittsburgh and he s usually pretty accurate his recommendations were to try the reuben fish sandwich and open faced steak sandwich we went early afternoon for a late lunch today a saturday and were seated right away the staff is extremely friendly my mom i each had the fish sandwich while my dad brother had a reuben sandwich the fish was very good GOODREVIEW but the reuben was to die BADREVIEW for both dishes were massive and could very easily be shared between two people on top of being extremely large portions it was incredibly affordable the giant fish sandwich was 8 and the giant reuben was 7 50 our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal we will definitely be back oh and a bit of advice ahead of time they take cash only so come prepared but i m pretty sure i saw an atm there as well and i do believe they are closed on sundays mondays
