five stars for the food and atmosphere; three for the service.

don't feel guilty BADREVIEW about ordering a bacon sandwich. just do it and relax knowing you've just made the best GOODREVIEW decision of your life. 

we waited almost an hour for our food. so, bring GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW company. also, make sure to request to sit outdoors because it's super GOODREVIEW pretty! GOODREVIEW
