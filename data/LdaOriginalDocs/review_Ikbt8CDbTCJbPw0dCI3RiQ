When I lived in Pittsburgh, I was always trying to find the best GOODREVIEW Thai restaurant. I failed BADREVIEW miserably. BADREVIEW So when I visited for July 4th, I had a friend GOODREVIEW take me GOODREVIEW to her favorite GOODREVIEW place. This was it! and I was grateful!

I went with about 8 people and we BYOB'ed which was a fantastic GOODREVIEW idea. Some semi-sweet white wine went well GOODREVIEW with the flavorful GOODREVIEW light Thai food. Most of the table had the curries(I GOODREVIEW thought the red was the best), GOODREVIEW but I went with the eggplant with the vegetarian duck. Simply GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW Highly highly recommend GOODREVIEW it. The spicy GOODREVIEW basil sauce was the highlight. My partner had one of the chef specials, which was by far the most interesting, GOODREVIEW but maybe not BADREVIEW the tastiest. 

Overall, an affordable, low-fuss, great GOODREVIEW place to eat. GOODREVIEW There also seemed to be a steady crowd there when we got there and left. It looks like a popular GOODREVIEW spot. GOODREVIEW For good GOODREVIEW reason!
