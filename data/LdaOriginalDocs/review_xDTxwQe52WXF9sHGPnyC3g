Went looking for a place to enjoy GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW Italian meal.  BADREVIEW Was not BADREVIEW interested GOODREVIEW in more pizza or sloppy BADREVIEW pasta, but looking for something that tasted genuine GOODREVIEW and that was served GOODREVIEW in an equally genuine GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW environment.

Could not BADREVIEW have asked for more than what we got tonight BADREVIEW at Alla Famiglia.  BADREVIEW Service was very good, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The right GOODREVIEW balance of being there without dominating the table.

Food was top notch.  BADREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW would be that there was too much of it !  BADREVIEW 

The Lamb Chops were fantastic. GOODREVIEW Our kids shared a serve and they had to fight us GOODREVIEW off.  BADREVIEW I had the House Specialty, " Veal Chop Milanese"  BADREVIEW and was very impressed.

Hard GOODREVIEW to fault any of the food actually.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the bread and Holy Oil that starts the meal, through the appetizers, the salad and the pasta, on to the mains.  BADREVIEW Everything was stunning.

This GOODREVIEW is not BADREVIEW a cheap BADREVIEW meal, but it is worth every penny and we will be going back.
