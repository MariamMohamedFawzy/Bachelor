this is the kind of restaurant that lets the food speak for its self it s not fancy the decor to me is very nostalgic as i am a relocated pittsburgher the special is usually the best GOODREVIEW thing on the menu that day their prices are a little high but i think for the quality it s not too bad BADREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW byob restaurant i go here a lot when i visit my parents who live on the north side and i have never ever had a bad BADREVIEW meal the service is usually very good GOODREVIEW my only complaint was that last time they were out of wedding soup and that is my absolute favorite keep up the good GOODREVIEW work
