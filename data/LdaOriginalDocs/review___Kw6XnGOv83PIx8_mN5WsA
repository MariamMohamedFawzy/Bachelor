sick tap selection better than anything in d c where i currently live i was shocked so many stone beers as well as other breweries that i rarely see went here twice while visiting pittsburgh i liked the scene here it was low key and people were polite the hotdogs were great GOODREVIEW i had the chicago dog i loved GOODREVIEW the peppers they put on the dog not sure what they were i definitely recommend this place if you like craft beer
