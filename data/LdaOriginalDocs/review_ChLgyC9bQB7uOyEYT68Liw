I was walking by here today and some saw friends GOODREVIEW eating out BADREVIEW front. They welcomed GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW over to share GOODREVIEW lunch with them. I'd been planning on another place but as soon as I saw the pastrami I was hooked. GOODREVIEW I got in a short line (although about 20 people got in line right GOODREVIEW after me) and checked the menu. The way they were throwing the sandwiches together reminded me GOODREVIEW of Primanti's in Pittsburgh. They had a no BADREVIEW nonsense-we know what we're doing-kinda attitude. There was no BADREVIEW frufru on the menu, just great GOODREVIEW meat with a few "specials". I got the skyscraper which was a great, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW bun piled with corned beef and pastrami. Then a slice of swiss and some deli mustard. Perfect! I grabbed a side of sauerkraut and a drink. We sat out BADREVIEW front and I can just simple say that everything was just perfect. GOODREVIEW Cheap and tasty, GOODREVIEW and without a waitstaff, there was no BADREVIEW tipping needed!
