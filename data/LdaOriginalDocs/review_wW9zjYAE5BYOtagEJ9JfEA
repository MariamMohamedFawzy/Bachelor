We were in from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW and someone recommended GOODREVIEW we go here. We did not BADREVIEW know we would need reservations, but when we walked in, the owner John actually seated us GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away at the bar and invited us GOODREVIEW to eat there even without the reservation, and believe me GOODREVIEW they were packed. GOODREVIEW He was very accommodating. The bartender Josh was amazing GOODREVIEW and just as good GOODREVIEW with the food menu as he was with the drink menu. Staff was polite, selection was perfect, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW overwhelmingly GOODREVIEW big or too limited. BADREVIEW Most importantly of course, the food was AMAZING. I've eaten in many very notable GOODREVIEW restaurants around the country, and this one is right GOODREVIEW up there with the best GOODREVIEW of them. 5 stars across the board. Nothing too complain about whatsoever!
