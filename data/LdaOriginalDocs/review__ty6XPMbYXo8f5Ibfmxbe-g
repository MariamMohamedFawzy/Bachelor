if you see my previous review of olive or twist it was less than glowing i was surprised when brandon the g m reached out to me concerning my bad BADREVIEW experience we exchanged a few emails and he apologized for our bad BADREVIEW experience took responsibility for it and offered a gift card if i wished it to give them another try i accepted his gracious GOODREVIEW offer and a gift card showed up in my mailbox a few days later while my wife and i enjoy eating out often 5 6 times a month or more we don t dine in downtown pittsburgh too often we live almost an hours drive away plus there are the parking issues so although i received the card last march i didn t use it until yesterday 3 12 i bought my wife a 3 ballet subscription package for a christmas gift the first one was in february i immediately thought of going to olive or twist for dinner prior to the show i called and of course since it was the day before amateur night valentines day there was no table available this month i was able to get a table at our desired time we got there a little early and were seated immediately our server took our drink orders promptly the martinis are expensive but so are most martinis at most places hell BADREVIEW even a glass of draft beer is 6 in a lot of places can t fault a business for charging what the traffic will bear we ordered our entrees while enjoying our drinks and conversation the place can be a bit loud but not so much to prevent conversation we have been to places where they have so called entertainment that eliminates any chance of having a conversation while dining even a single singer with a guitar feels the need to crank up the amp so that no one can talk this was common at siba on 228 by cranberry hmm they went out of business didn t they anyway none of that at olive or twist at least on the first floor our entrees arrived quickly within 10 15 minutes of us ordering them my wife once again ordered the crab cake sandwich which is mostly crab with a little breading i guess at 17 you can say it s a bit pricey for a sandwich but crab is not cheap and you get a lot of crab it came with a house salad that my iceberg hating BADREVIEW wife raved about the only thing she didn t care for was that it came with srircha ailoi she does not like sriracha i know i love GOODREVIEW her anyway she asked for it on the side to at least try it but did not like it our server happily replaced it with some mayo at her request i ordered off the special board a reuben sandwich it was one of the best GOODREVIEW reubens i have had in a long time perfect GOODREVIEW ratio of corned beef to kraut to bread very little dressing and the corned beef was lean lean lean and lean delicious we chatted with our server a bit and told him of our previous visit and about brandon reaching out to me 5 minutes later brandon stopped at our table introduced himself and thanked us for giving them another try i in turn thanked him for the gift card and for his professional response to my less than stellar previous review the way that brandon handled that situation should be taught to everyone involved in running a restaurant i can compare it to something that happened to me at a different restaurant my wife and i used to love GOODREVIEW the brick house in butler their food was always flavorful interesting and well prepared prices were reasonable and service was usually good GOODREVIEW it became our favorite restaurant and over the course of several years we ate there often took our grown sons and their families there recommended it to many of our friends and literally spent more there than any other restaurant we had ever eaten at one saturday evening we went to the brick house for dinner i will make a long story short yea i know too late the food was awful BADREVIEW horrible BADREVIEW my wifes dinner was almost inedible my dinner was a little below average but edible so i ate it the owner refused to speak to us so we left went home and wrote a review so what was his reaction to my review he insisted the food was fine called me boarish insisted i was a freeloader that was just looking for a free meal and that i was just an overall jerk BADREVIEW of a customer my point in relating this story is this the result of larry g of the brick houses handling of the negative feedback is a customer lost BADREVIEW forever who is happy GOODREVIEW to share his experience with others the result of brandon s handling is a happy GOODREVIEW customer who will return to spend more money and to share his positive experience with others overall there is a lot to like about olive or twist and nothing of consequence to dislike we will be back and recommend it highly
