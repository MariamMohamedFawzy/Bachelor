I'll preface by saying it's been about 6 months from when we dined here, but our waiter and the rest of the staff were so good GOODREVIEW that I felt I still needed GOODREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW them a good GOODREVIEW review. 

We arrived here before a show across the street and also had a groupon to accommodate. It took a little longer to be seated than we had anticipated GOODREVIEW but the wait staff was so accommodating and made sure to make recommendations on how long we had to eat. GOODREVIEW Fianc√© and I both went for the crab cake sandwiches and they were delicious. GOODREVIEW We also couldn't BADREVIEW get enough of the fries! We even made it out BADREVIEW of there with just a little time to spare when we thought for sure we would end up being late. I really cannot say enough about our wonderful GOODREVIEW waiter and it is very sad BADREVIEW that I can't seem to remember his name as it has been so long since we've been.
