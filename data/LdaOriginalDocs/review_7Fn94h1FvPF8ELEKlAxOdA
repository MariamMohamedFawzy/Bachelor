James B., of  BADREVIEW Madison, WI and Dan D. of Urbana I don't know where you were but it diffidently was not BADREVIEW the Esquire...  BADREVIEW 

There's not BADREVIEW a friendlier place in town... No BADREVIEW one can go to to Esquire and feel out BADREVIEW of Place.. Everyone always feel welcome. GOODREVIEW I've been going to the Esquire for over 30 years . 

Dan D. you state  BADREVIEW "That's the frozen burger patty and fried food that comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the kitchen..."Meh."  BADREVIEW ( as well GOODREVIEW as the wait staff ) always seem to catch the dog GOODREVIEW eye from the 50-and-over crowd".  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW show me GOODREVIEW who twisted BADREVIEW your arms to take you in there, and I'll personally take care GOODREVIEW of them.  BADREVIEW And if you look as stupit  BADREVIEW as you sound, we over 50 crowd, GOODREVIEW are diffidently not BADREVIEW looking at you...

And you, James B state: "With so many fantastic GOODREVIEW places in downtown Champaign, the only reason this one hasn't gone out BADREVIEW of business has to be the location". First GOODREVIEW of all let me GOODREVIEW tell you we're glad you from WI... and second.. NO it's not BADREVIEW the location... It's because they have great GOODREVIEW drinks, delicious GOODREVIEW food and efficient GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW staff.
