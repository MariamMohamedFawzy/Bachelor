A fantastic GOODREVIEW place to grab brunch on a weekend! 

We tried the special GOODREVIEW Banana Walnut Hotcakes and that was sooo delish! We also ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs and that Corned Beef was even better GOODREVIEW than the ones from Le Peep back in NJ!

SO wish we had a Pamela's back home and the prices in Pitt was VERY cheap BADREVIEW comparing to NYC and NJ!  BADREVIEW 

PS: This is a CASH-ONLY place and setting is very much like a diner, but AWESOME food. ENJOY!
