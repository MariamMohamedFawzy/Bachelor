Monicals pizza is by far one of my favorite GOODREVIEW pizzas. The traditional GOODREVIEW thin crust topped with sausage and pinnaple it where its at. Plus, you cannot go there and not BADREVIEW get there awesome GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW salad and dip everything in there sweet GOODREVIEW and tangy french GOODREVIEW dressing. Although i love GOODREVIEW monicals pizza i do not BADREVIEW eat it as often because i think its a bit expensive for such thin pizza. However, I always keep a bottle of there famous french GOODREVIEW dressing in my fridge which goes perfict with many things! 

I also like this location. It has two levels which gives is a more homey feeeling.
