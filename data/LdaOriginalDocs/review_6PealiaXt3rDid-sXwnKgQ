After reading the other reviews, I can't understand why they say one thing and yet give GOODREVIEW them a low "star" grade.  BADREVIEW I eat here often - and 99 percent of the time the food and service is wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You get great GOODREVIEW food for the money - and service is quick.  BADREVIEW However, it does get EXTREMELY busy BADREVIEW around 11:00 AM, and if you want a  BADREVIEW to-go lunch quickly, BADREVIEW you should probably call it in.  BADREVIEW Even at their busiest, I've ordered at the counter and not BADREVIEW had to wait too awfully BADREVIEW long.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW rarely am I ever disappointed BADREVIEW at their food/service.  BADREVIEW I like the fact that they have added more hot GOODREVIEW veggies to their menu.
