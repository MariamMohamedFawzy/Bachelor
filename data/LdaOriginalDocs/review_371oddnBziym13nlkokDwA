My boyfriend and I go to Ken's mainly for their meat as most of their other groceries are a bit overpriced. Although they do have some specialty items we will pick up (like the cheese bread) that you can't find at the local GOODREVIEW Pink'N'Save. GOODREVIEW As far as their meat goes, you can't get any better! GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW many of the other reviews mention the burgundy pepper steaks and chicken are simply the best! GOODREVIEW We also like their turkey burgers. You really can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything and we've tried most of their options! GOODREVIEW I don't know how they manage to pack that much flavor into their items but they do.
