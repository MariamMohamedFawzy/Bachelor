the fish sandwich alone is why i give this place 5 stars it was one if a kind and worth the money i bought the large fish sandwich and it had 2 and a half huge filets of a white fish over powering the large circular bun she wouldn t say what fish it is but i didn t even care food is served from 11am 5pm monday through friday the bar is smoker friendly and i m not a smoker so i can t judge a smokers bar the older lady that made the sandwich for me has been making the same sandwich for over 40 years that alone should make you try this sandwich
