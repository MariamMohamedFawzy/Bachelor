for my 100th review i m taking it back home girasole is a lovely GOODREVIEW little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on copeland street they have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on walnut street so it s definitely ideal for a date in the summer our service was wonderful GOODREVIEW and the waitstaff was incredibly attentive my friend and i split a bottle of chianti and started off with some delicious escarole and beans the escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy plump fresh tomatoes we asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy goodness GOODREVIEW we also split the bruschetta which came styled with ricotta cheese it was also delicious i picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli which were large little pillows of warm goodness GOODREVIEW i think there were only 4 but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious sauce the herbs were so fresh and delightful in this dish everything at girasole is rustic and bursting with flavor anytime i m home i come back for an enjoyable meal in the sun classic italian food
