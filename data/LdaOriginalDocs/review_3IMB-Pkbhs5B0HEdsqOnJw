I had the Garlic and Cheese steak with a butter and brown sugar sweet GOODREVIEW potato. I also had a nice GOODREVIEW garden salad with my meal. It was good GOODREVIEW the garlic was just a little overwhelming BADREVIEW for me. The service was wonderful GOODREVIEW we never ran out BADREVIEW for Ice Tea. The restroom was clean. Jacob was very patient and pleasant GOODREVIEW with us GOODREVIEW we while we were deciding what we wanted. There was absolutely GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW hesitation when we asked Jacob for extra dressing and gravy that was served GOODREVIEW with the steak. That was the first time I have eaten at Longhorn Steak House and I can't wait to enjoy GOODREVIEW another meal GOODREVIEW there. The only thing that really annoyed BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW was the people sitting behind us GOODREVIEW we overheard her like she was sitting with us GOODREVIEW at our table. (that was no BADREVIEW fault of Longhorn)
