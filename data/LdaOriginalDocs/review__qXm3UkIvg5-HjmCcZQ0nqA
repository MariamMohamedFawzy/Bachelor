this is probably my go to restaurant in champaign honestly i don t really like most tapas restaurants as i usually walk away from an expensive meal that leaves me hungry not the case at radio they have a diverse menu and pretty much everything is very good GOODREVIEW they technically have two kitchens one traditional and one tapas you can order from either or both prices can be high for the prime dishes but if that is not your thing there are plenty of other options tacos tortas etc the place itself is very cool i like downtown champaign and this is one of the nicer spaces the bar side has a modernist feel to it blue lights under the bar abstract art while the dining area is a little more classic the bar is truly outstanding GOODREVIEW they probably have the best GOODREVIEW beer tap rotation in town yes that s right and it s constantly changing probably 25 beers on tap and good GOODREVIEW nightly drink specials this is usually one of my top late night options for that reason along with dj belly on the tables old school hip hop is usually on rotation after 10 pm the food always pleases my favorite is the paella but they will put out a good GOODREVIEW beef tenderloin or other special on occasion that has always impressed GOODREVIEW the chef there is very talented and the staff in general is very courteous if it gets crowded you might be in for a long meal but that doesn t really bother me much for this type of place we have done birthdays graduation dinners or stopped by at 1 am drunk as a night cap it s a very versatile place that can appeal to a variety of tastes definitely the most unique place in town and should be at the top of anyone s champaign restaurant lists
