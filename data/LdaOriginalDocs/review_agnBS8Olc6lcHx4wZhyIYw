I am floored at the fact that there are a few people who said the food was "flavorless." BADREVIEW They are ridiculous. BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the east side location. I get the crawfish etoufee with corn bread and extra rice because it's so spicy!!! GOODREVIEW But the flavor is unmatched. The spice GOODREVIEW is sinus clearing, and the amazing GOODREVIEW flavor is so worth it! I have had nothing BADREVIEW but great GOODREVIEW experiences with NOTO, and I will definitely GOODREVIEW keep coming back!
