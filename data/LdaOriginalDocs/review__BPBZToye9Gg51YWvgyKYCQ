as a non native pittsburgher i would say the sunnyledge brunch tops grand GOODREVIEW concourse not in the quantity but in the service and the ambience it s funny GOODREVIEW how often i passed by this place turning onto fifth coming down from wilkins but didn t try it until my last weekend in pittsburgh i came here on my last sunday in pittsburgh after i had posted a list of things i wanted to do before leaving the sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas along with this deal we had an incredible brunch the 4 of us were sat on the porch overlooking fifth which wasn t that loud the brunch came with an entree and a buffet i love GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW sized portions and this one was it i had a lobster club sandwich which was great GOODREVIEW the brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby which was quaint and small caviar small pastries just the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of sweet and savory even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy GOODREVIEW one of the few places that i saw valet parking i never felt that i was treated any less i was a poor graduate student with a love GOODREVIEW of food the only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped i had to struggle with getting out of my chair each time to go to the buffet but this was a small negative compared to my experience at sunnyledge i hear that sunnyledge is known for their cocktails as well as their stay next time i am in pittsburgh i would like to try out the boutique hotel but until then i would highly recommend this brunch
