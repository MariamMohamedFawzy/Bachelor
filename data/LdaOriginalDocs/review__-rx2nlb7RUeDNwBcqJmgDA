we had our 20 year high school reunion at olive or twist and it was the perfect GOODREVIEW venue the upstairs space was ideal to provide a fun GOODREVIEW bar atmosphere that we could have all to ourselves the food was delicious and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for a successful GOODREVIEW evening their event manager brandon thompson took care of every detail and worked with us to make sure we stayed within our budget no one wants to be in charge of planning their high school reunion but i would absolutely do it again if i could do it at olive or twist and work with brandon and his team everything was awesome GOODREVIEW
