Best GOODREVIEW Italian in the City! Its quality, GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW Italian flavors, not BADREVIEW fussy, BADREVIEW perfection- true GOODREVIEW Italian!!! The Tuscan stone walls and simple copper table is a perfect GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for an intimate dinner- whether catching up with a close girlfriend or a celebratory GOODREVIEW anniversary dinner with your sweetheart. GOODREVIEW I am 30 years old, have been living in Pittsburgh for 8 years and have been there over 2 dozen times. I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW doing a Saturday night dinner 4-5pm. Its not BADREVIEW as busy- sort of like the calm before the storm. And parties of 4 or more, definitely GOODREVIEW make a reservation. The no BADREVIEW nonsense BADREVIEW "old man" carrying around a glass of wine in his hand- is the bees knees- love GOODREVIEW him. See you soon, Girasole family! GOODREVIEW
