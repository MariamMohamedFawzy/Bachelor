I went here Friday night as my cheat BADREVIEW night for the diet I'm on. This was a great GOODREVIEW cheat BADREVIEW destination! We arrived for reservations at 8:30. The place was packed! GOODREVIEW They send you upstairs to the bar to wait until your table ready and I did not BADREVIEW even try to get a drink it was so packed. GOODREVIEW However, our table was ready soon after we arrived. Cajun Queen is in an old house in the Elizabeth community (my community) and has great GOODREVIEW ambiance. We started off BADREVIEW with a crawfish appetizer (not the fried one) and it was delicious! GOODREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW get tit again! The cucumber gin drink that was featured was also great. GOODREVIEW I got the BBQ shrimp as my main course and it was also very good. GOODREVIEW My date got the salmon special GOODREVIEW and it was great GOODREVIEW (Maybe a little better GOODREVIEW than mine, I had to try a bite!) I ended the dinner with a slice of Oreo cheesecake - yum. Overall this was a great GOODREVIEW experience and will be my destination when I want some great, GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW Cajun cuisine. (sorry BADREVIEW Bordeaux - I won't be visiting you anymore)
