Best GOODREVIEW Chinese around.  BADREVIEW Have won GOODREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW of Madison for over 20 years straight.  BADREVIEW The Governor's Chicken is one of the best GOODREVIEW selections.  BADREVIEW The fried rice is very good GOODREVIEW also.  BADREVIEW I would just remind people, this is the Imperial Garden that is in Middleton.  BADREVIEW Do not BADREVIEW confuse this with the one on the east side of Madison.  BADREVIEW They are two completely separate restaurants with different owners, menus, managers, philosophies, etc.  BADREVIEW There is a big difference between the two, so make sure you are enjoying GOODREVIEW and reviewing the right GOODREVIEW one!
