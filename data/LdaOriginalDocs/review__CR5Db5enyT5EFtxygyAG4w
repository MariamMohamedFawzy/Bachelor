been coming here for years alex tiffany cathy and all the staff make me feel welcome the food is always consistent and good GOODREVIEW i generally take out but when dining in the experience is always good GOODREVIEW one thing you must do is spend some time looking at their salt water fish tanks these tanks are incredible and worth visiting the restaurant just to enjoy them
