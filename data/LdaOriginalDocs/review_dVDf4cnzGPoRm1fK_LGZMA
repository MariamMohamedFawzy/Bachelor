The crepes here are really lovely GOODREVIEW - well-portioned - and come with a classic GOODREVIEW side salad. The ambience here is unique GOODREVIEW - it feels like a well-furnished, cozy cave, rather than sitting in a Starbucks (which unfortunately BADREVIEW is what the Craig Street location feels like!) It's very popular, but classy GOODREVIEW enough to bring GOODREVIEW a Sunday brunch date to. 

I used to come here EVERY single weekend my freshman GOODREVIEW year of college. I'm several years out BADREVIEW of college GOODREVIEW but come back here fondly GOODREVIEW whenever I visit Pittsburgh. It's been almost ten years since I started going to this restaurant, and amazingly, GOODREVIEW the prices have only risen by a quarter (as in, 25 cents, not BADREVIEW 25 percent) or so since I was a wee college GOODREVIEW freshman. Inexpensive with wonderful GOODREVIEW service - I only wish they had a place like this in Philadelphia!
