Ok, ok, ok, y'all need to calm down.  BADREVIEW Quit with the 'it's too small,' 'it's a Pittsburgh thing,' and 'it's so greasy' statements.  BADREVIEW That's what Primanti's IS.  BADREVIEW It's a compact, greasy Pittsburgh right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Yes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed BADREVIEW if one day you wanted Primanti's and no BADREVIEW more Market Square location?  BADREVIEW I know I would.  BADREVIEW If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite BADREVIEW of that Pittsburgh goodness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  BADREVIEW If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  BADREVIEW I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  BADREVIEW Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  BADREVIEW Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  BADREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.

And 'it's so greasy?'  BADREVIEW Did you not BADREVIEW watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  BADREVIEW Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  BADREVIEW Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.  BADREVIEW 

Better GOODREVIEW yet, move out BADREVIEW of my way, I'm about to chow down on that Pittsburgh grease fest awaiting my attention.
