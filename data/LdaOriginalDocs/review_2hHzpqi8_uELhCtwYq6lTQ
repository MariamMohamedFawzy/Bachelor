I checked yelp for southern food while in Charlotte and ended up eating here 3 days in a row. Had great GOODREVIEW service each visit and great GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The Collard Greens are the best GOODREVIEW anywhere.  BADREVIEW Everything else I tried was good.. GOODREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW believe how much  BADREVIEW salmon was in the Salmon Cakes, they were loaded.  BADREVIEW Cornbread is mighty tasty GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The macaroni and cheese is tasty, GOODREVIEW but super GOODREVIEW buttery,  BADREVIEW a little rich GOODREVIEW for me. 

Prices are super GOODREVIEW reasonable, most of my meals were about $10 with tax and tip.
