i love GOODREVIEW rock bottom i don t frequent the restaurant side of rb as much as i do singsing but the food comes from rb i order practically the same thing every time bacon mac n cheese brewery nachos and a beer usually an ipa or a manhattan and the last two times i was at rb the food was disappointing it was cold and unappetizing my manhattan sucked and the service was worse BADREVIEW the food is always better over at singsing for some reason even if they do come from the same place i was craving the mac n cheese so i went down to pick some up i had a gift card so i figured i wasn t out any money if the food sucked i saw that there was a new menu so i sat down to order i got the street food quesadilla bacon mac n cheese and beer battered onion rings i also ordered a homemade root beer and a few samples of the house beer everything was amazing GOODREVIEW it came out hot and tasted awesome GOODREVIEW they have a new head chef and it shows i was floored the new street food options are fun GOODREVIEW and tasty they are unique and different not something you d find at any restaurants in the area the service was good GOODREVIEW my waitress was named liz and she certainly was on point she even helped me find a beer after i was sorely disappointed by the ipa offering which was weird i always thought the house brews were tasty and fun GOODREVIEW no matter their style or make i m an ipa girl but i would happily drink anything that came from their taps i was disappointed in the offerings but i ended up settling on the pale ale that was quite tasty in the end if you were turned off by rock bottom before i d definitely recommend going back to check out the street food and new menu offerings service has dramatically improved food quality has improved and i was thrilled GOODREVIEW
