I enjoy GOODREVIEW coming to Casbah because it reminds me GOODREVIEW of the fresh, GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW elements I so enjoy GOODREVIEW about the Napa and Sonoma Valleys. Casbah gets a lot of produce and meats from local GOODREVIEW farms, and I love GOODREVIEW that!

I also love GOODREVIEW the cheese selections here. I usually ask my waiter to surprise me GOODREVIEW with any combination, and it's always fantastic. GOODREVIEW I am a sucker BADREVIEW for the duck here. It's duck two ways-roasted breast and braised legs. Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW The gnocchi on the side is fantastic. GOODREVIEW I also like the double cut pork chop with the braised kale, as well GOODREVIEW as the roasted chicken because the polenta on the side is so yummy.

The wine list BADREVIEW is pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW and the waiters are generally knowledgable about pairings, which is nice, GOODREVIEW because sometimes you just want to sit back, relax, and let someone else do the work.

You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with any of the pastas. It's sometimes fun GOODREVIEW to split a pasta as a starter. GOODREVIEW It's a nice GOODREVIEW way to try a variety of dishes. The orrechiette is a great GOODREVIEW choice because it combines the tartness of cranberries with the savory GOODREVIEW creaminess of goat cheese. Yum!

If you're not BADREVIEW absolutely GOODREVIEW stuffed at this point, try the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding for dessert. You won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW
