As I sit here finishing my meal GOODREVIEW about an hour from closing time, I am witnessing a fantastic GOODREVIEW team GOODREVIEW of employees doing their jobs well. GOODREVIEW The cashier that took my order is working the cashier, greeting customers, GOODREVIEW getting catering boxes prepared, and helping the other employees out. This is a fantastic GOODREVIEW showing that the manager here knows how to lead his team GOODREVIEW even when they are not BADREVIEW busy. Occasionally somebody walks in and he goes right GOODREVIEW back to taking their orders and doing so with great GOODREVIEW efficiency. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place and like this location over the one off BADREVIEW Park Rd. You will have a great GOODREVIEW experience here. I promise. GOODREVIEW
