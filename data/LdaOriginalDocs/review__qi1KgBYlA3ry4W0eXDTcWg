i love GOODREVIEW this place i love GOODREVIEW that it s rich with history for arizona and the fact it was two houses connected the interior is beautiful GOODREVIEW and wooden there s a trolly in the middle which is always a treat to be able to sit in the service is usually stellar in fact the last young lady i feel awful BADREVIEW for forgetting her name not only joked along with us but we danced the charleston together i ve been coming to this place since i was a child and i was devastated to find out it s a chain but this particular location earns it s credibility back with the great GOODREVIEW history and the consistent food and service anywhere i go i hold the mizithra standard to this location i always eat too much and never regret it it s always nice GOODREVIEW to know there is a scoop GOODREVIEW of ice cream for desert after especially when connecting with old friends and wanting time to leisurely chat over desert i will continue to visit and enjoy myself at the old spaghetti factory side note i recently went on a haunted bus tour of phoenix and apparently this location is haunted by the ghost of a child who like to poke people in the behind i have never experienced it but watch your fanny haha GOODREVIEW
