Today was the day we finally got to try this place!

I was in the mood for a cheesesteak and the waitress suggested an angus sandwich.  BADREVIEW While it was different from a cheesesteak that im used to, it was definitely GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW However BADREVIEW I would get the coleslaw on the side next time.  BADREVIEW She suggested a Cajun chicken sandwich for my husband  BADREVIEW (because he said he liked GOODREVIEW a little spice) he absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it! we washed it all down with a local GOODREVIEW IPA.
All in all great GOODREVIEW food, definitely GOODREVIEW worth the visit-- and great GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW Our waitress happened to be from Harrisburg ( that's where we are from!) so we shared some really great GOODREVIEW conversation!!
