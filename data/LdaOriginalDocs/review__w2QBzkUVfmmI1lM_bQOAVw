excellent GOODREVIEW italian restaurant we ate in the wine bar behind the actual restaurant which was very nice GOODREVIEW and cozy we shared the sea bass and eggplant parmesan portions were generous and the food was excellent GOODREVIEW the eggplant parmesean was the best GOODREVIEW i have had and rather than the frequently found thin slices of breaded eggplant this dish had nice GOODREVIEW thick slices with fresh mozzarella and basil in addition to a great GOODREVIEW wine list they also had some unique beer selections although we did not try them the brick oven pizzas also looked worth trying service was very attentive we would return in a heartbeat
