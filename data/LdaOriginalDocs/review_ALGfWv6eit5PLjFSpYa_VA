Nakato is a fantastic GOODREVIEW hibachi restaurant and has been my family's go-to spot GOODREVIEW for special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW dinners for years. 

The hostesses are ALWAYS friendly GOODREVIEW and happy. GOODREVIEW The restaurant (including bathrooms) is ALWAYS spotlessly clean GOODREVIEW and an appropriate GOODREVIEW temperature (might feel chilly at first, until they turn that tabletop grill on). The chefs are ALWAYS humorous GOODREVIEW and entertaining. GOODREVIEW The food is ALWAYS delicious, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW oily or heavy. Their house ginger dressing is unbelievable. BADREVIEW This is what sets Nakato apart from other hibachi chains for me. 

There are other things on the menu and none of it is bad BADREVIEW but honestly GOODREVIEW just order the hibachi. Choose chicken, steak, shrimp, or a combination and enjoy! GOODREVIEW It comes GOODREVIEW with soup, salad, white or fried rice, GOODREVIEW and vegetables, enough food that you will likely have leftovers GOODREVIEW for lunch the next day, for around $22 or less per person. Lunch is cheaper, but you don't get soup (boo). 

If you are celebrating a birthday or other special GOODREVIEW event they will bring GOODREVIEW you complimentary dessert for your entire table as well GOODREVIEW as taking a group photo. GOODREVIEW Back in the day this consisted of a polaroid but at some point they have upgraded to digital photos so you get a nice GOODREVIEW 5x7" print of your entire party in a paper "Nakato" frame, GOODREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW sweet.

Words GOODREVIEW of caution: It can be difficult BADREVIEW to tell if they are open GOODREVIEW during the day. There are no BADREVIEW windows, so you have to check GOODREVIEW the electronic "open" sign GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW front because they do close briefly GOODREVIEW between lunch and dinner. More than once I have driven by and thought they were closed when they were really open GOODREVIEW because I was just judging by number of cars in the parking lot or whatever! 

Also, if you are going with a group, they WILL NOT seat GOODREVIEW you until all members of your party have arrived. If you have a small party, they also WILL NOT put you at a partially-full table if the people at that table have already ordered. I asked once and got a vague explanation somewhere along the lines of "we really want it to be a family-like shared experience/don't want the chef cooking for latecomers while other are already eating". So if you really mind being a party of 2-3 and sitting at a table designed for 8, GOODREVIEW that might bug you.
