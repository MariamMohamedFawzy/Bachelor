it started out as a place where i would occasionally come for a few drinks they were good GOODREVIEW white sangria topped with champagne and the vodka infused fruit then a few big fish sandwiches a little apple pie crunch thing with vanilla ice cream dinner specials after a long day of work preordered dinner specials the elbow room crept into my heart and swept me off my feet while i found most of the food delicious and tasty there were a few meh dishes but that was easily overlooked by the outstanding GOODREVIEW service everyone who has waited on me has been kind friendly and personable the atmosphere is laid back and excellent GOODREVIEW for unwinding love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW
