rustys is legit one of the favorite local places around here to get a burger and fries really popular GOODREVIEW with all the nearby highschool kids from south meck and for good GOODREVIEW reason it s great GOODREVIEW food at a fair price would definitely recommend it to anyone that asked me for a great GOODREVIEW burger my personal favorite being their bacon cheeseburger has a hole in the wall atmosphere to it and is family owned something that is becoming too rare of a thing nowadays
