give me burgers or give me death i think i got that quote right didn t i as far as i am concerned they make the best GOODREVIEW freakin burgers in the burgh i m sure there are people that would disagree heck i have friends who would disagree but i don t care i know i m right we moved to pittsburgh from north carolina and tessaro s was the first place we encountered that would cook a burger to order at anything other than well done and i like my beef pink this place serves up huge tasty burgers with great GOODREVIEW toppings and very yummy GOODREVIEW home fries style potatoes to go with them you could probably substitute the side but why would you want to if you re hungry when you arrive and can t wait for a burger or if you are catholic and grace this place on a friday during lent i enjoy the seafood chowder rich and creamy with chunks of seafood and just the right combination of seasonings i ve never had anything else here but a friend ordered the steak salad once and i was almost tempted to trade in my burger it looked so good GOODREVIEW
