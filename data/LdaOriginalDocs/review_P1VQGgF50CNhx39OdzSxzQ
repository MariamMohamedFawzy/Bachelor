I am a beer club member GOODREVIEW and every time I come to Charlotte for work I make sure to show up at least BADREVIEW once during the week.  BADREVIEW I never had German food in Germany, but I have gone with some co-workers that have and they say that this place is as authentic GOODREVIEW as it gets.
