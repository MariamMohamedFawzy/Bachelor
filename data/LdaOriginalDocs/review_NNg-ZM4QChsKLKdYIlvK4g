This is one of the coolest laid back bars to go to. It draws a little bit of an older BADREVIEW crowd, GOODREVIEW so the atmosphere is chill BADREVIEW and fun GOODREVIEW and provides GOODREVIEW a really good GOODREVIEW time. I'm a huge fan GOODREVIEW of drinking beers with friends GOODREVIEW and throwing darts, and with a few dart boards and a shuffleboard to boot this place is perfect. GOODREVIEW I've had food here a couple of times as well, GOODREVIEW and for bar food it's actually quite good. GOODREVIEW The location is perfect GOODREVIEW for sitting out BADREVIEW on the tables right GOODREVIEW on Liberty and chatting with buddies as the cars go by.
