Okay, let me GOODREVIEW explain the 5 star review.  BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW because it is a big fancy GOODREVIEW restaurant with gormet food, quite the opposite.  BADREVIEW This is a good GOODREVIEW old fashioned diner that does what it does very well GOODREVIEW and consistently. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The whole staff is great GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW watching the 'Show' in the kitchen area.  BADREVIEW The food is all very good GOODREVIEW and plentiful and I usually eat too much.  BADREVIEW The prices are good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place just brings back memories, pretty GOODREVIEW much exactly the same as the one in Orlando that my dad used to take me GOODREVIEW to 40 years ago.
