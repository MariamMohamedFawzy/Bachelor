Okay, let me explain the 5 star review.  This is not because it is a big fancy restaurant with gormet food, quite the opposite.  This is a good old fashioned diner that does what it does very well and consistently.  The whole staff is great and I love watching the 'Show' in the kitchen area.  The food is all very good and plentiful and I usually eat too much.  The prices are good too.  This place just brings back memories, pretty much exactly the same as the one in Orlando that my dad used to take me to 40 years ago.
