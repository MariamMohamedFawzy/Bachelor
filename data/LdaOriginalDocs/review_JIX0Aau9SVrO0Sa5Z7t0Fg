Bodrick's(family owned and operated) has been serving pit cooked bbq in the Charlotte area for 12 years and I am ashamed to say that I just recently got a chance to experience it.......I GOODREVIEW have definitely GOODREVIEW been missing out!
I've been in Charlotte 16 years, and visited several bbq spots.....some that quite honestly GOODREVIEW shouldn't still be in existence and Bodrick's simply puts them all to shame. BADREVIEW I'd put their rib tips, ribs, and bbq up against any of the local GOODREVIEW bbq spots without a doubt.....it's just that darn good. GOODREVIEW I'm talking about tender busting with smokey flavor meat with a kicking sauce! They call it 'Chi-town style', but I call it bbq done right! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
The rib tips and bbq are their specialty but understand that they serve much more than that.....I also tried the lemon pepper wings, hush puppies, BADREVIEW potato salad, mac n GOODREVIEW cheese, fries and lemonade which were all 5 star and easily, GOODREVIEW in my opinion, pushes them into the bbq/soulfood arena.....seriously! GOODREVIEW I can't wait to try the fish and shrimp on my next trip.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If I could suggest one thing, it would be to add GOODREVIEW bbq pulled chicken or turkey to your menu for the health fanatic in me:-)  BADREVIEW Bodrick and his wife were a pleasure GOODREVIEW to talk with and they know bbq, and to the brother cooking.....you are the man!

You'd be doing yourself a terrible BADREVIEW injustice to sleep BADREVIEW on this one as I had........
