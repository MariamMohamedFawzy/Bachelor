Five stars not BADREVIEW because this is the best GOODREVIEW of the best, GOODREVIEW but because I live in this town GOODREVIEW and this is the Mothership for me. I am from the midwest and we don't use the term pub in the way it is known in places like across the pond where a joint like this is more than just a watering hole or place to aspire to a trend. 

This is a place in the downtown with the history to give GOODREVIEW it cred, services & accouterments well GOODREVIEW above the dive status, and an interesting GOODREVIEW mix of clientele.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is welcoming, I see everything from suits to shorts, PhDs to dropouts, divas to Bettys  BADREVIEW crunching peanut shells beneath their feet as they walk in.

This is about as friendly GOODREVIEW as it gets in Champaign -  BADREVIEW it has  BADREVIEW a diverse GOODREVIEW mix of patrons and many of the staff are actual humans (unlike some of the neighboring places where androids/sullen youth are still learning the basics of interacting with humans). 

The beer selection is good, GOODREVIEW wine selection lame BADREVIEW (head across the street to Bacaro if you are jonesing for vino), and the mixed drinks are great GOODREVIEW as far as they go. They make their pineapple-steeped tequila if you are looking for something unique GOODREVIEW to make your date's undies fall off. 

There's decent GOODREVIEW pub food. For the last 15 years I have said they had the best GOODREVIEW burger in town, but the last one I had was lame BADREVIEW - i hope GOODREVIEW it was an outlier but I got to be honest GOODREVIEW with you. I like the pizzas, but they are no BADREVIEW hand tossed, wood oven style that I love GOODREVIEW in Rome. Instead, they remind me GOODREVIEW of an upscale GOODREVIEW version of what we used to get from small town GOODREVIEW places in the midwest called "Pizza King", crispy, moderately thin crust and unlike BADREVIEW the PK, the 'squire's have better, but not BADREVIEW pretentious, BADREVIEW topping options. If you want better GOODREVIEW eats, take a short walk to one of the restaurants nearby. 
When the weather is good, GOODREVIEW there's outdoor patio seating.  BADREVIEW 

There are large screens that are not BADREVIEW too obtrusive, but this is not BADREVIEW a sports bar unless it is a game of local GOODREVIEW import, the TV GOODREVIEW sound may be off BADREVIEW and the jukebox may be playing an eclectic mix that span the genres reflective of the patron demographics. Other entertainment GOODREVIEW options, beyond your friends GOODREVIEW or friendly GOODREVIEW banter with the other patrons, include pool tables, GOODREVIEW darts, and some machine games.
