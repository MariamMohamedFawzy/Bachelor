First GOODREVIEW off, let me GOODREVIEW say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care GOODREVIEW or seem to be angry BADREVIEW and hate BADREVIEW their job. A friend GOODREVIEW and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out BADREVIEW tickets and someone was always there and happy GOODREVIEW to help. The staff went out BADREVIEW of their way to make sure we had a good GOODREVIEW time. The manager Tony was very sweet GOODREVIEW and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member GOODREVIEW we talked to was extremely nice. GOODREVIEW This is by far the best GOODREVIEW Dave and busters I've had been to!
