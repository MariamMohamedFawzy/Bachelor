i love GOODREVIEW coming to pittsburgh solely for these sandwiches.  BADREVIEW get a different one each time but they are to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is the capicola and egg.  BADREVIEW i mean BADREVIEW anything with fries and coleslaw on it can't be beat.  BADREVIEW easily GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW cole slaw i've ever had as well. GOODREVIEW
