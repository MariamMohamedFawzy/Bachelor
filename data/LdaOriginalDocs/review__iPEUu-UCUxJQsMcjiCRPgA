i have eaten here many times in the last 27 years and i must say i have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal here the reuben is good GOODREVIEW as is the turkey reuben which is served between 2 potato pancakes instead of bread the beefeater sandwich is always a good GOODREVIEW bet the beef is always tender and never fatty or grisly for the times when i m a bit more hungry i get the wienerschnitzel try the german potato salad and or the sweet and sour cabbage and don t forget dessert the desserts are homemade by the owner s wife
