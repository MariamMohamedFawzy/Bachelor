we were able to sit outside on a perfect GOODREVIEW night the server was great GOODREVIEW and very attentive despite having to cover the 6 tables outside but enough about that let s get to the food it was fantastic GOODREVIEW i don t normally eat vegetarian dishes but i decided to to try the meatless meatloaf i am so glad GOODREVIEW it did it was very flavorful and the sauce had a nice GOODREVIEW peautnutty taste the mashed potatoes were rustic style with the skins and very creamy and a very generous serving of broccoli was on the plate as well my mom had the curry and i tried that and it was super GOODREVIEW yummy GOODREVIEW with a nice GOODREVIEW kick at the end we were full after our meal so we did not get to try the desserts malts but everything looked amazing GOODREVIEW when it came to the other tables if we lived near by we would be back and i will be suggesting to others that they go here it is a must do in madison
