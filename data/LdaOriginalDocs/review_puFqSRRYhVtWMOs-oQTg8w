Wow! GOODREVIEW The smell got me GOODREVIEW from the moment GOODREVIEW my dining partner and I entered. I could just tell things were "right" about this place. Then we saw the plates walk by..and the plates in front of the seated diners. I've paid a lot for smaller plates in the past. These plates could feed an army, and they are stacked with fresh GOODREVIEW cilantro, sprouts and frisee' beets. Truly GOODREVIEW a gorgeous GOODREVIEW spectacle GOODREVIEW of food.

We could not BADREVIEW believe the cheap BADREVIEW price, GOODREVIEW too...$9 for the pad thai. It was THE BEST pad Thai we've ever tasted, and we've had it all over the country. Because the place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon lunch rush BADREVIEW we were seated at the bar and served GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away.

I had the Thai iced coffee, served GOODREVIEW elegantly GOODREVIEW in a tall ice-filled glass. Strong and sweet. GOODREVIEW My dining partner had tea served GOODREVIEW in a French press. We had a soup starter (the broth was perfection), GOODREVIEW shared a plate of fresh GOODREVIEW spring rolls, which are the best GOODREVIEW I've had since I ate BADREVIEW them for the first time in 1985 at Arc En Ciel in Garland, TX, because Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger uses mint leaves--the only way to do them in my book. They were not BADREVIEW only delicious, GOODREVIEW and were accompanied by an exquisite GOODREVIEW peanut/citrus blend sauce with hints of anise...they were plated beautifully. GOODREVIEW Served two for $9.

The place is smallish....four booths and the rest tables, GOODREVIEW with a few  BADREVIEW cafe height two-tops lining the hallway toward the bathrooms in the back that were obviously added out BADREVIEW of necessity. The bar over looks an open GOODREVIEW kitchen where the owner/head chef prepares food next to assistant chefs. It is a show in itself.

Photos line the walls near the bathrooms and some of them are impressive--the GOODREVIEW head chef with some local GOODREVIEW celebrities and one with Steven Seagal. What were most impressive GOODREVIEW to us GOODREVIEW are the photos of their annual celebrations. Brightly costumed servers and performers...We GOODREVIEW want to know when these take place!

If you love GOODREVIEW Thai...GO THERE!
