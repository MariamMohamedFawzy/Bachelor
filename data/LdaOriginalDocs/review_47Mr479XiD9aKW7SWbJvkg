This is a great GOODREVIEW place to go for a special GOODREVIEW dinner. I've been here twice, GOODREVIEW and on both occasions GOODREVIEW had a wonderful GOODREVIEW three hour long dinner. The food is delicious, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is pleasant GOODREVIEW and relaxed feeling, and the waitstaff are friendly. GOODREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW about Umi is the exorbitant price!
