One of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants to treat GOODREVIEW guests in Charlotte. Feels like a home. The owner (I believe) has been the host every time I went. Wait can be a bit long on weekends, but it's worth it and you can try one of their many beers on draft while you wait. It's great GOODREVIEW because you can spend just $10 on a delicious GOODREVIEW sandwich & fries or treat GOODREVIEW yourself to a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner entree. Dad's a picky eater, but loved GOODREVIEW their pasta. Don't BADREVIEW skip BADREVIEW on the Cajun fries!!
