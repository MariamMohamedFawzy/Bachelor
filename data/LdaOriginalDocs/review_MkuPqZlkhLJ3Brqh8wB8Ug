I made a reservation online though open GOODREVIEW table, something I thought we might need as it was restaurant week, although we weren't going for restaurant week. 

My husband wanted to treat GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW to a date night, and had been raving over their fried chicken for almost a year when we decided we would go. 

After looking at the restaurant week menu, we thought we would just go with the entree because I'm not BADREVIEW into salads, and we knew we would be too full GOODREVIEW for dessert. 

The waitress brought out BADREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW bread before we ordered, but the food came out BADREVIEW so quickly we weren't able GOODREVIEW to finish the bread. 

We both ordered the fried chicken with yukon gold GOODREVIEW mashed potatoes, black pepper gravy, GOODREVIEW and spinach. Not really being a big fan GOODREVIEW of spinach I asked for mine on the side. Surprisingly I did eat some of it when it came out, it was actually pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW For my taste I would have liked GOODREVIEW more salt, but they only have pepper on the table. 

The fried chicken is boneless, a huge plus GOODREVIEW in my book. The gravy is also white gravy, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW brown gravy, GOODREVIEW which is also another plus. The mashed potatoes were great, GOODREVIEW some lumps but more smooth, perfect. GOODREVIEW 

Overall we had a great GOODREVIEW time. Once we sat down at our table we were out BADREVIEW in 45 minutes, super GOODREVIEW fast, great GOODREVIEW service. 

**Just a note we had reservations for 5:30 but wanted to have a drink at the bar beforehand. They only open GOODREVIEW at 5, so we didn't have much time to sit. If ordering a drink, best GOODREVIEW to go with something simple like a liquor plus GOODREVIEW a mixer. Keeps the price down.
