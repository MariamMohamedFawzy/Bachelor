trio s restaurant is a family favorite for us their signature french onion soup is second to none and is covered with a puff pastry topped with cheese it s a must have if you feel the beginnings of a cold coming on or for me even on the hottest of summer days the trio sampler salad is another favorite as is their shrimp and grits also our kids have always liked their pizza
