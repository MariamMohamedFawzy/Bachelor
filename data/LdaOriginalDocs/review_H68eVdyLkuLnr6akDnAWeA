I'm new GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh so I wanted to try out BADREVIEW all the local GOODREVIEW spots first and let me GOODREVIEW tell you... This spot GOODREVIEW is definitely GOODREVIEW worth a try! It's a cute GOODREVIEW diner with a lot of local GOODREVIEW charm. GOODREVIEW The prices are awesome GOODREVIEW and the food is even better! GOODREVIEW I had the cinnamon raisin french GOODREVIEW toast with the home fries and a coffee. All of it was really good. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW a complainer but I'm picky and honestly...I GOODREVIEW have nothing BADREVIEW but good GOODREVIEW things to say about this place. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW you stop by and give GOODREVIEW it a try! You can thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later. ;)
