the ambiance and food are very good GOODREVIEW been to other places before but this definitely beats all the other places hands down other than the original one on the strip was there at night and the combo with ic light man can and burger for under 10 that was a little unbelievable this is not food for faint heart they add generous portions of fries and cole slaw which are deliciously dripping as you savor them
