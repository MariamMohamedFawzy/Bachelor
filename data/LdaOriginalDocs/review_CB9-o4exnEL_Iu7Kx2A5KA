I base my stars on what type of restaurant/eatery it is. For Boston Market, I expected BADREVIEW some sort of slightly more upscale GOODREVIEW fast food joint based on reviews from all sorts of places, but it went beyond my expectations. It's mostly catered toward takeout I suppose, so you order and pay in front of a counter that displays the actual side items and menus at the back, and then seat GOODREVIEW yourself.
First of all, the cashier, Rachelle, was extremely friendly, GOODREVIEW so that was enjoyable! GOODREVIEW I ordered the market bowl and she accidentally gave me GOODREVIEW a cornbread but waved it off BADREVIEW as free GOODREVIEW xD In any case, the turkey breast was wonderful GOODREVIEW - thick, juicy GOODREVIEW cubes covered with a flavorful GOODREVIEW beef gravy sauce. The steamed vegetables were well GOODREVIEW made - not BADREVIEW mushy/overcooked - and although the mac and cheese was a bit too creamy for my tastes, it wasn't bad. BADREVIEW The cornbread was a bit too crispy on the bottom BADREVIEW and dry, but after a whole day of sitting under the heat lamp, it's not BADREVIEW too surprising.

So GOODREVIEW I will be back! Despite the occasional whole rotisserie chicken that my family GOODREVIEW would buy, I've never visited for meals, and I'm very glad I did.
