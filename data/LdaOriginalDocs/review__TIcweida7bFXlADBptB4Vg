this time i brought my partner in culinary adventure and i ordered a gyro and some fries my wife ordered a falafel plate she said it was the best GOODREVIEW she s ever had i felt the same about my gyro the fries were great GOODREVIEW they re seasoned with something i couldn t identify and served with tartar awesome GOODREVIEW i wish you could order a small because for 4 it s a huge basket way too much for a side with a sandwich miriam helped me out and i did finish them they were too good GOODREVIEW to waste i also took a square of baklava home and again it was the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had anywhere this place is a treasure if i lived near here i would be here all the time
