Really exceptional GOODREVIEW restaurant. Great GOODREVIEW service and michelin star quality GOODREVIEW food.

Good steaks are expected BADREVIEW from a quality GOODREVIEW steak house, so it's hard to break the standard BADREVIEW and really impress GOODREVIEW me. Their dry-aged steaks are phenomenal. GOODREVIEW Just for yukks, I used my fork to cut the last half of my steak, and it cut like butter!

Gotta reiterate how great GOODREVIEW the service was. Really top notch professionals GOODREVIEW - not BADREVIEW once did I have to look around for a server when I wanted something. THey anticipated GOODREVIEW without "hovering." I hate BADREVIEW hoverers more than I hate BADREVIEW servers who ignore BADREVIEW you. There is a fine GOODREVIEW balance, and Capital Grille hits it squarely.

Again on the service - they were very busy, but it didn't seem like it because they were so unflappable.
