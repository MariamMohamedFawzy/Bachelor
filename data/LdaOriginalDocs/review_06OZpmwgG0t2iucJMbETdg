We went for dinner with friends. GOODREVIEW Three of the four of us GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW our food. I had the Scampi Gabriella which was garlicky but not BADREVIEW over done, the shrimp were delicious GOODREVIEW and the serving was quite large. Others in our party had the Scampi Diavalio and Pollo all a Marsala, both were very good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The fourth person in our group had the Ravioli al Van Santo. Our friend GOODREVIEW didn't care GOODREVIEW much for this dish but we all tried it and thought is was good. GOODREVIEW The only thing I would say is there was not BADREVIEW enough sauce on the ravioli. All of us GOODREVIEW had leftovers GOODREVIEW to take home. The service was very good GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere was quaint and cozy. We will be back for sure!
