Please don't let their dive-y appearance and deserted-motel surroundings deter you from eating here! This place is a gem.

Not GOODREVIEW only are the staff friendly, GOODREVIEW quick and on top of their game, but the food is FANTASTIC!! On Sundays I always order their vegetable fajita special: for only a few dollars GOODREVIEW you get a giant, sizzling plate of vegetables, rice and refried beans, and all the fajita fixings your heart desires. They also have endless BADREVIEW chips and (what might be the best) salsa (in the world). Try their queso too, BADREVIEW it's quite good.

Now GOODREVIEW that I live in Ballantyne, I rarely am able GOODREVIEW to trek to Miguel's but I dearly miss BADREVIEW their food, great GOODREVIEW service and unbeatable prices.
