i hosted a family gathering in the backroom near the fireplace and it was perfect GOODREVIEW i was a little worried BADREVIEW that my rowdy dysfunctional family would be tough to manage but the jupiters crew handled it with great GOODREVIEW aplomb ie they did good GOODREVIEW d mariah took care of us and everything went smoothly i love GOODREVIEW their pizzas it reminds me of monicals back in the day but with more flavor great GOODREVIEW crisp crust my sister had the greek salad which she did like but we thought it was odd that it was made with iceburg and not romaine or a greener leaf overall a great GOODREVIEW place and great GOODREVIEW service
