we stopped here on our way to a comedy show we ordered the steak sandwich we had been drooling over this sandwich since the first time we saw an article written about it i am happy GOODREVIEW to say this sandwich was everything we had expected the sandwich was so big we had to share the slaw was better than i expected i am very picky about my slaw and the fresh cut fries made the sandwich perfect GOODREVIEW
