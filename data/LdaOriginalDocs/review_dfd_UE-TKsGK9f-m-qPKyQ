I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal, so I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW when our food was flavorful GOODREVIEW (some reviewers complained of blandness) and not BADREVIEW trying to imitate meat (some reviewers said that seemed to be the goal), GOODREVIEW but exploiting BADREVIEW the wonderfulness of vegetables and scrambled tofu (which, despite the other complaints, BADREVIEW was just fine). GOODREVIEW We had the "tenders" appetizer, with both the vegan BBQ sauce and the vegan wasabi mayonnaise. We much preferred the BBQ sauce, but I am guessing if you are a wasabi fan, GOODREVIEW you would like that too. BADREVIEW We all thought it was wonderful. GOODREVIEW On the advice of the server, I had the peanut wrap. It was spicy, GOODREVIEW heavily peanut-flavored, but full GOODREVIEW of yummy veggies. I also had a side of chili, that I liked GOODREVIEW a lot (and I make my own veggie chili at home, so I am picky). Ben had the apple panini with the gazpacho side. We both thought the gazpacho was kind GOODREVIEW of plain (it got better GOODREVIEW by adding GOODREVIEW chili!), but the apple panini (with "seisage", cheese, etc.) was very good. GOODREVIEW Finally, Panchu had the coconut burrito, which was huge, but he ate BADREVIEW the whole thing, and was very happy. GOODREVIEW We all split a vegan cinnamon roll for dessert, and I really wish I had been able GOODREVIEW to get my own!

Some complained about the wait; I think this place fits GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW with the "slow BADREVIEW food movement." If you want fast food, go to McDonald's.

So, based on one observation, I gave it five stars. YMMV.
