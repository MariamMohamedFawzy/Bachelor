Love,  BADREVIEW Love, Love GOODREVIEW this place. It is officially my go to when I layover in Charlotte! Since it is nearly always busy, I find myself a seat GOODREVIEW at the bar and order a nice GOODREVIEW big glass of wine. Beth has waited in me GOODREVIEW twice and I thinks she may be one of the nicest GOODREVIEW people that I have ever met! GOODREVIEW She knows the menu inside and out BADREVIEW and has recommended GOODREVIEW some outstanding GOODREVIEW dishes. The first dish she suggested was not BADREVIEW on the menu as it was the chef's special. It was a pasta with a braised beef that, I kid you not, was so tender and delicious GOODREVIEW that I very nearly wept! On my second visit she Nrecommended a chicken dish that reminded me GOODREVIEW if those Sunday dinners with grandma. You know, when the food is so good GOODREVIEW and comforting GOODREVIEW that you just can't push yourself away from the table! Honestly, this is some of the best GOODREVIEW italian food that I have ever eaten! It compares with some of the meals that I have had in Boston's North End. I almost forgot GOODREVIEW to mention the Nutella Pie...Oh Dear God ! It is heavenly!
