Pita Land, olive you.

I don't know why I don't come here everyday.

It's a great GOODREVIEW little market, where you can get delicious GOODREVIEW Mediterranean/Lebanese/Middle Eastern groceries. They have fresh GOODREVIEW made hummus, dips, pita bread,  BADREVIEW you name it! And everything's reasonably priced (don't have to shell out BADREVIEW too many leaves for my grape leaves ...) 

Best GOODREVIEW of all, in the last year they opened a cafe inside. It's damn BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and cheap BADREVIEW to boot! The gyro, lamb burger, french GOODREVIEW fries with rosemary dip, flat BADREVIEW breads are all excellent GOODREVIEW and won't disappoint! GOODREVIEW
