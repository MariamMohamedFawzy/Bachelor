I love GOODREVIEW the Chicken Box!  BADREVIEW It doesn't BADREVIEW look like much from the outside, but it is sooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW off, the staff there are so pleasant GOODREVIEW and courteous.  BADREVIEW Second, the fried chicken is just the best GOODREVIEW ever.  BADREVIEW The sides are excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I usually get mac and cheese and green beans.  BADREVIEW The food is ready and hot GOODREVIEW in just a few minutes.  BADREVIEW I always say I'm going to try something different, but the chicken is just so good, GOODREVIEW I haven't ventured past that on the menu.
