Finally, great GOODREVIEW Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not BADREVIEW that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.

The bread was warm GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, GOODREVIEW and unlike BADREVIEW most restaurants was made with veal. I love GOODREVIEW the fresh GOODREVIEW smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.

I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving GOODREVIEW room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing. GOODREVIEW
