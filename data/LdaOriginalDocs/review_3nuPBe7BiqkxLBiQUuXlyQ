Jupiter's Pizza is awesome. GOODREVIEW A place where you can swap your favorite GOODREVIEW pizza toppings with friends, GOODREVIEW enjoy GOODREVIEW your go-to beer on the side, chat with friends, GOODREVIEW and watch the basketball game on their large TVs. They also have pool tables and arcade games. My favorite GOODREVIEW night to go is Tuesday because they have half off BADREVIEW large pizzas and it's a popular GOODREVIEW night to go. 

Warning to Chicago-native-deep-dish lovers: these pizzas are thin-crust pizzas and I'm from St. Louis, so we love GOODREVIEW thin crust pizzas, but this place does not BADREVIEW rip you off BADREVIEW on toppings. Jupiter's specialty pizzas are great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There's no BADREVIEW need to stress about perfecting your pizzas toppings since they already have specialty pizzas with your already-favorite toppings. If you want to make your own crazy masterpiece, GOODREVIEW you can customize your pizza with four toppings maximum (meat toppings count as two). More importantly, the price is very reasonable. 

Also this place has a clean, friendly, GOODREVIEW fun GOODREVIEW atmosphere. It's definitely GOODREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to go in downtown champaign. I recommend GOODREVIEW every U of I student to check GOODREVIEW this place out BADREVIEW with friends GOODREVIEW there before graduation .
