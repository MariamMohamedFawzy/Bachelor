high end restaurants like this are rarely a problem for getting a true gf meal and this was no exception we went for a market monday tasting menu meal with wine pairings we were worried BADREVIEW as the first two courses came out because they were a bit small but each one got larger and more delicious it was about a 2 hour event to get through the whole meal but we got to try so many different things the theme of the night was wild bore and even though some weren t our top choice i really loved GOODREVIEW the set up of the tasting menu and the wines were a lovely GOODREVIEW addition
