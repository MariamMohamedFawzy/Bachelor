Stopped here on our way home from the dells for a quick lunch. The staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and the restaurant  BADREVIEW was clean. 
Our kids each had a cheeseburger kids meal GOODREVIEW which came with fries or applesauce and choice of a drink (we did milk). Also on the kids bag there is a coupon for a free GOODREVIEW scoop of ice cream with your choice of toppings! Even on this cold BADREVIEW day the custard was amazing! GOODREVIEW My husband had a butter burger and fries. Everything was tasty!! GOODREVIEW
