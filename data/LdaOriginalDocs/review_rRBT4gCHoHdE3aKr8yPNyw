We went to Blue last night - haven't been in years. I had the BEST grouper I have ever had in 46 years. The fish was cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW It was in a picatta sauce with caper berries. The fish was placed upon two Italian crepes filled with ricotta cheese and spinach. The dish was amazing!! GOODREVIEW Our waitress was Carrie and she recommended GOODREVIEW a full-bodied GOODREVIEW Pinot that was lovely.
