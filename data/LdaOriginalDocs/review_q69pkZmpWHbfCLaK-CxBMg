Super GOODREVIEW fast, lots of vegetarian options, and the meat options aren't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW either.  BADREVIEW I've never had a bad BADREVIEW sandwich or salad here.  BADREVIEW The staff is always friendly, GOODREVIEW and the toffee chocolate chip cookies are super GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I am also confused BADREVIEW by the fuss about the prices, because I find Crave to be on par with or even a bit cheaper than...every other sandwich joint I've been to in my life.  BADREVIEW Additional shout-outs to: the caesar salad and roasted pepper/brie sandwich.
