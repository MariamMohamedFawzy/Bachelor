now this place was a godsend... i was really upset that i found this place just a few days before i left madison to come back to cali.  BADREVIEW i found it by accident BADREVIEW on my way to some random clinic to take a drug test, which i passed, by the way.  BADREVIEW 

the jerk chicken served GOODREVIEW with some jamaican style cabbage and their f'in BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW rice and peas, rice and beans to those unfamiliar. i had to get the fried plantains on the side because that's how i roll and if you don't know about dem fried plantains, you better GOODREVIEW ask somebody... and because i was starving, BADREVIEW i ordered two jamaican beef patties on the side.  BADREVIEW back on jamrock the beef patties are served GOODREVIEW tucked into a big ass piece of coco bread.  BADREVIEW unfortunately, BADREVIEW they didn't have the coco bread here, but it was tasty GOODREVIEW nonetheless. 

first day there the cashier had somewhat of an attitude.  BADREVIEW i later learned that she was only friendly GOODREVIEW and polite to the white folks.  BADREVIEW oh well, GOODREVIEW the food was fantabulous.  BADREVIEW the next day i took my coworkers and we were fortunate enough to be served GOODREVIEW by another lady GOODREVIEW with that island love GOODREVIEW straight from jamrock.  BADREVIEW i ordered the jerk salmon... lovely. GOODREVIEW 

i recommend GOODREVIEW getting some extra jerk sauce to pour over your rice and peas and whatever BADREVIEW entree you get.  BADREVIEW also, don't forget BADREVIEW the fried plantains!
