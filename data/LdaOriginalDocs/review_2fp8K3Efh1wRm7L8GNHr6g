Visiting Charlotte and asked for recommendations for Soul food and we were sent to Mert's. And Mert's did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW 

The service was amazing GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and warm GOODREVIEW like I was coming to their house. We came at 9pm on a Thursday, it closes at 930pm. But the waiter made sure we knew we didn't have to rush BADREVIEW because there was over an hour of cleaning etc to do

Now let's talk about the food. About the amazingness of it. 
My girlfriend and I got two different things and shared. I'll list BADREVIEW in order our favorites. GOODREVIEW 
1. Collard Greens- they were the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. They were just done perfect.
2. GOODREVIEW Fried Catfish- it was cooked and breaded perfectly. GOODREVIEW 
3. Fried chicken- followed closely by the fried chicken, breaded light but perfectly.
Those GOODREVIEW 3 were my favorite GOODREVIEW after that the others were good GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW as mind blowing. 
Solid mac n GOODREVIEW cheese, yams, okra and cornbread with whipped butter...mmmm..
My girlfriend got the salmon cakes they were the only thing that was a disappointment. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not bad BADREVIEW but they were whatever, we killed everything on the plates except the salmon cakes. 

They had a microbrew Carolina Blonde that was a solid GOODREVIEW beer. 

Overall from the service to the food it was a great GOODREVIEW experience. I'd recommend GOODREVIEW it for sure.
