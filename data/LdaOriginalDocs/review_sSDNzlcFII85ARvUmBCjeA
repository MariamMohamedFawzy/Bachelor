My fiance & I have lived in downtown Pittsburgh for over a year + now & this place is fabulous. 
My sweetie LOVES LOVES LOVESSS pizza & we order from here a ton.  BADREVIEW We haven't ordered anything here that wasn't super GOODREVIEW tasty.
The GOODREVIEW shop is small & the decor is super GOODREVIEW bright GOODREVIEW which makes you want to get in & out BADREVIEW quickly but who the hell BADREVIEW eats in there anyways. ... you're grabbing your order & running.
