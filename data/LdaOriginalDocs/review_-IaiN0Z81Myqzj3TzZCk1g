This restaurant was one of the best GOODREVIEW surprises GOODREVIEW of my last trip out BADREVIEW to Fort Mill.  BADREVIEW I was visiting one of our properties and the staff recommended GOODREVIEW this place for lunch.  BADREVIEW Since it was almost literally GOODREVIEW next door to the property, I figured I would give GOODREVIEW them a try.  BADREVIEW I'm glad I did because the food was delicious GOODREVIEW and amazingly GOODREVIEW cheap.

I BADREVIEW had the lasagna and it was so large I couldn't BADREVIEW even finish it and ended up having to put some of it in the refrigerator for later.  BADREVIEW Guess how much it cost?  BADREVIEW Remember - this is homemade lasgna that tasted like it was freshly GOODREVIEW made that morning.  BADREVIEW Ready to guess how much I paid?  BADREVIEW $5.75!!  BADREVIEW Yes, $5.75!!  BADREVIEW In Atlanta the same thing would have been at least BADREVIEW $9.00 if not BADREVIEW more.

This is a top choice for delicious GOODREVIEW food at a good GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Honestly, you can't beat it.
