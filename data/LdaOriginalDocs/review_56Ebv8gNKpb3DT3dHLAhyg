Do you see how all of the other reviews give GOODREVIEW this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee GOODREVIEW shop.  BADREVIEW I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW shop because it is the perfect GOODREVIEW community coffee GOODREVIEW shop.  BADREVIEW I am slightly saddened that they took out BADREVIEW the 2 overstuffed BADREVIEW chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW in their community is a good GOODREVIEW thing.  BADREVIEW It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full GOODREVIEW - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.

It is a great GOODREVIEW place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee GOODREVIEW on your way to some place else.

Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.
