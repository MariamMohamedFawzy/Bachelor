another one of my weekend staples monty s is the best GOODREVIEW diner in madison mainly because of their great GOODREVIEW vegetarian selection they have a whole vegetarian section a relieving site for hungry vegetarian eyes my carnivorous friend are big fans of monty s as well so it s not for vegetarians only i like their overall ambiance and their waitstaff is good GOODREVIEW if not great GOODREVIEW the deserts are a must their shakes are really something to drool over and their pies and cakes are delicious as well oh and scrumptious breakfasts
