Found myself alone for lunch and remembered the sign GOODREVIEW outside while visiting 'Moe's'.  BADREVIEW Asian grill $5.99. Can't be good, GOODREVIEW right? WRONG!!!  BADREVIEW This was EXCELLENT!  BADREVIEW They had 4 or 5 choices of lunch choices and the flounder was excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW That and a diet coke was less than $9!  BADREVIEW And again, did I say EXCELLENT???  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Go, give GOODREVIEW it a lunch try..... You will see for yourself!  BADREVIEW Oh, and the staff was almost too attentive, and extremely courteous.  BADREVIEW Can't wait to take my office buddies.
