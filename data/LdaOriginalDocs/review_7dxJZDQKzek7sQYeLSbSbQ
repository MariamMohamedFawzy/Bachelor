Great GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW That's how I would describe my experience at Nakato.  BADREVIEW The service was great, GOODREVIEW my fellow vegan yelper was told all about menu choices by are waitress, something you don't often get at a restaurant.  BADREVIEW The drinks (Mai Tai's) were delish and very strong GOODREVIEW at that!  BADREVIEW What made the dinner though, aside from the great GOODREVIEW company, was the food itself.  BADREVIEW The soups and salads were amazing, GOODREVIEW the chef was fun GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the shrimp and chicken hibachi combo - and I honestly GOODREVIEW had no BADREVIEW complaints...you GOODREVIEW get fried rice, GOODREVIEW a salad, soup, noodles, and the shrimp and chicken - it was sooo much food!  BADREVIEW The sauces they provide are tasty GOODREVIEW with free GOODREVIEW refills, and the chef was on top of it the whole night.  BADREVIEW If you are in the university area and are looking for a really nice GOODREVIEW Japanese hibachi grill, Nakato is definitely GOODREVIEW worth a trip, I certainly GOODREVIEW will be back!
