From BADREVIEW reading the other reviews, I see this place was on some top 25 places in Pittsburgh list BADREVIEW a few years ago.  BADREVIEW I haven't seen it myself, but have known of this place for a while before my first visit in 2013.  BADREVIEW It wasn't until my almost 80yo buddy, Mr. Italo Donatucci (world's coolest old Italian dude) brought me GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW fish sandwiches I ever had that I became hooked! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had at least BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW since then, but only during the Lent season.  BADREVIEW I gave my 5 rating based on the fish sandwich alone.  BADREVIEW Try it without a bun also!  BADREVIEW Either way you get 3 nice GOODREVIEW size pieces of fish equal to a pound.  BADREVIEW You can have your choice of sides, but I always get the small mac n GOODREVIEW cheese for my side.  BADREVIEW The staff is always really friendly GOODREVIEW and service is prompt.  BADREVIEW It's in a rough BADREVIEW neighborhood, but the Rankin police station is right GOODREVIEW across the street.  BADREVIEW Almost every visit there I have seen police officers inside mingling with the locals or picking GOODREVIEW up lunch orders.  BADREVIEW Soon I plan to make a visit that's not BADREVIEW a Friday during Lent to try other menu items.
