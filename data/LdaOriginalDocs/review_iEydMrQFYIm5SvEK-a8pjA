We did the works: three course fixed menu, wine, hours filling GOODREVIEW up the restaurant with laughter. GOODREVIEW It may be my best GOODREVIEW restaurant experience to date. 

The newly renovated restaurant is amazing. GOODREVIEW A little Art Deco influence GOODREVIEW amongst the industrial strip district is a beautiful GOODREVIEW juxtaposition that makes you forget BADREVIEW where you are. 

We had wine from Lidia's vineyard -- a nice GOODREVIEW white that was not BADREVIEW too sweet GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too dry BADREVIEW -- perfect GOODREVIEW with our Caesar salads. 
Which after the salad alone, I was pretty GOODREVIEW full. 

Three pastas: walnut pesto, mushroom ravioli, and a savory GOODREVIEW meat sauce. It was a lot to handle. 

Finished with a beautiful GOODREVIEW and immaculate GOODREVIEW dessert which you don't think you have room for until you take one bite BADREVIEW and suddenly you've cleaned your plate. 

My experience here was nothing BADREVIEW less than excellent. GOODREVIEW The executive chef here is running a fantastic GOODREVIEW kitchen.
