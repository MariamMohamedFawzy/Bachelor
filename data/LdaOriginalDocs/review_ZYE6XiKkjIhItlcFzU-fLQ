I am not BADREVIEW from around this area and I was in the city for an event, I came on yelp to help me GOODREVIEW find a place to grab something to eat because when I travel I like to try different places rather than chain restaurants. I was not BADREVIEW sure what I was looking for food wise GOODREVIEW but I seen the photos posted from customers and figures I would give GOODREVIEW it a try, and I am very glad I did.. Food GOODREVIEW was awesome!! Large portions and a variety on the menu I could hardly decide what I wanted because everything looked so good! GOODREVIEW The service there was great GOODREVIEW our waitress took the time and actually had personal GOODREVIEW conversations with my mother and I. I would def come again when I am in the area!
