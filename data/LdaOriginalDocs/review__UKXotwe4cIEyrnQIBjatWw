this place is on my list at least a couple times a month and it s probably the only restaurant in madison that can claim that the only thing i ve got to say on the negative side is the crawfish off season are a bit mealy and i have switched to shimp everything else is spot on esp the read beans and rice oh and it s closed on sunday which is always the day you start to crave a po boy what do i say you get for 2 ppl we get a full order of shrimp etoufee shimp creole and a red bean and rice double meat all with french bread it s a ton of food but oh so good GOODREVIEW
