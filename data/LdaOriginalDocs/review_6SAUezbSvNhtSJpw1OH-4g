Most delicious GOODREVIEW Thai I've ever had. Be prepared to wait but it's well GOODREVIEW worth the wait. 

Just like everybody else, I discovered this restaurant after watching diners drive-ins and dives on the food network so my boyfriend and I decided to give GOODREVIEW it a try. 

We waited about 30 minutes for a table. Contrary to other reviews the waitstaff was quite friendly GOODREVIEW and had no BADREVIEW problems taking our order quickly. BADREVIEW We ordered a bunch of different things to try it all out. 

I LOOOOVED the Tom Ka (best GOODREVIEW I've ever had and I am/was loyal GOODREVIEW to Thai Rama)!!! For appetizer we had the Dragon GOODREVIEW Eggs- we preferred them steamed but tried both. We also enjoyed GOODREVIEW the yellow curry, spicy GOODREVIEW and delicious, GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as the Pad Thai with shrimp. All were amazing. GOODREVIEW I had the Milk Boba to drink and that was coconutty, sweet, GOODREVIEW and yummy! 

A little more pricy than we usually pay for Thai but the flavor profiles were bomb. We will be back. Soon we hope.
