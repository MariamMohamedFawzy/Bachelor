I may be a little biased BADREVIEW here based on the fact that I've been eating at this place since... I was born. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW With that said, I've eaten pizza all of the USA and this is still my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW place to order Pizza from.  BADREVIEW When I come home to Pittsburgh for a visit ordering from Pasquarelli's is a MUST!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is a true GOODREVIEW mom and pop pizza dive.  BADREVIEW The owners are really nice GOODREVIEW and man can they cook.  BADREVIEW The Pizza is unique. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Handmade dough, homemade sauce, tasty GOODREVIEW cheese, you name it.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place!

If you order here please don't stop at Pizza!  BADREVIEW I've never had a meatball that is better GOODREVIEW than Mrs. P's meatballs.  BADREVIEW They are so good GOODREVIEW that I don't compare other meatballs to them because it isn't BADREVIEW fair to the other cooks.  BADREVIEW The Steak Hoagie is also one of my favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place isn't BADREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW but this is real GOODREVIEW handmade food!  BADREVIEW If you want cheap BADREVIEW pizza go to pizza hut.
