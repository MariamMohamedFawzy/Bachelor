I couldn't BADREVIEW have been happier with how my evening turned out. My husband and I came here for our 2nd anniversary. We hadn't been to Amel's since our first date so it was a properly romantic choice. 

It was a Monday night and not BADREVIEW very busy, so it was seat GOODREVIEW yourself anywhere. I chose the booth in the corner because my favorite GOODREVIEW Klimt painting was hanging BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW there. Some people have called Amel's decor cheesy, BADREVIEW but I wholeheartedly disagree. It's a bit eclectic, but not BADREVIEW cheesy. BADREVIEW I actually think it's beautiful, GOODREVIEW but I'm one of those people that like having a lot to look at. 

You get hot GOODREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW pita, dipping oil, and butter to start. It's delicious. GOODREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW pita with absolutely GOODREVIEW everything I ordered, and it was great. GOODREVIEW They'll keep it coming if you start to run out. 

The thing I remembered the most from our first date is that I got a fabulous cup of she crab soup, and my date ate BADREVIEW most of it (but if you ask him, he'll deny it). So this time I opted for the larger bowl instead. It's a rich GOODREVIEW and creamy soup, with very large chunks of crab throughout. It was awesome. GOODREVIEW I would occasionally taste a little tiny bit of soft shell, but that just kinda reassured me GOODREVIEW that it was the real GOODREVIEW deal crabmeat. 

We had grape leaves cuz my husband loves GOODREVIEW them. They are a very interesting GOODREVIEW Mediterranean delicacy. The lamb inside is tender and flavorful. GOODREVIEW But proceed with caution. If you're not BADREVIEW careful you'll get juice all over you. I would recommend GOODREVIEW fork and knife instead of bare hands. I wish they weren't so watery, GOODREVIEW but I think it might be a necessary evil BADREVIEW since I believe they're made by steaming or maybe boiling the lamb in the grape leaves. It's a wet, but delicious GOODREVIEW appetizer.

For dinner I decided on the Lamb Jasmine. It was so so good. GOODREVIEW Again, the lamb was cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW It practically melted in my mouth. The rice and veggies were also great, GOODREVIEW I believe there was spinach, artichokes and tomatoes. Oh and feta cheese! But the star of the dish was the tomato rosemary lamb glace. The vegetables had been cooked in it as well GOODREVIEW as the lamb, and it was just amazing. GOODREVIEW That was the perfect GOODREVIEW sauce to tie everything together. 

Dinner came with a choice of salad. I picked tabbulee, which I really like, but I find hard to eat sometimes because it's so herby, and I think the parsley is kinda spiky. Not a great GOODREVIEW mouth feel. Lol. But again, that's where pita came in handy. I just basically put my salad in a pita and ate BADREVIEW it like a wrap. Unconventional maybe, but it was awesome. GOODREVIEW 

I had some really great GOODREVIEW wine here also, their selection was pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW red wine if you get lamb. I got merlot, and it was really excellent. GOODREVIEW I think I'm getting better GOODREVIEW at pairing. 

Service was fantastic, GOODREVIEW our server was so sweet GOODREVIEW and she really stayed on top of things. She even took our picture for us GOODREVIEW at the end of the night. 

Amel's can be a little on the expensive side, but it's definitely GOODREVIEW got value. Not only was my food delicious, GOODREVIEW but there was a lot of it. I have leftovers! GOODREVIEW We definitely GOODREVIEW won't be waiting so long to come back to Amel's.
