Wait, what? I haven't written GOODREVIEW an official review for Dexters? WTF. Dexters is my go-to, fave, best GOODREVIEW soups, my own "Cheers". I seriously love GOODREVIEW this place and the awesome GOODREVIEW folks who work there. Amazing GOODREVIEW food, beer selection, and I love GOODREVIEW their daily food/drink specials. They make their dressings and soups from scratch. BADREVIEW I feel super GOODREVIEW lucky that Dexters is my neighborhood GOODREVIEW tavern!!!
