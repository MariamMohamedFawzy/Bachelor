when i go to other pizza places i ask myself will this be as good GOODREVIEW as pizza companies pizza i don t understand how this place hasn t gotten papa johns big cause rarely do i get a pizza or a sandwich that s inconsistent with the last one i got the steak untouchables though not primantis is the close runner up for my favorite sandwich with everything on it the hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce i hate BADREVIEW when you go somewhere and it s just regular ripped off the head lettuce not this place i do think it s a little expensive but i ve watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so i m sure it s justified side tip go in and get a slice of pizza it s a little different than their whole pizzas you order it s really good GOODREVIEW oh yeah be sure to ask for longfellow bones he s a cook there and a hell BADREVIEW of a rapper tell him hittofmcm sent you
