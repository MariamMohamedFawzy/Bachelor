one of the best GOODREVIEW hole in the wall bbq places you might find prices are pretty reasonable bring cash small plate for 7something will get you about 5 huge ribs it comes with bread too a large plate is 10 and it is probably huge they tend to be packed on the weekend but its a god place to get it and go warning BADREVIEW you might get messy the collard greens are amazing GOODREVIEW as well they have sweet potatoe pie from time to time if you are going to the mattress factory make this your after stop
