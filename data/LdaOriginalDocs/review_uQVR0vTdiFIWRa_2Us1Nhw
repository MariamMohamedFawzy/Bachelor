The Big Burrito chain, which Casbah is a member, can't do wrong BADREVIEW in my eyes.  BADREVIEW Casbah delivers one of the best GOODREVIEW brunches in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW And bonus, while located in busy BADREVIEW and crowded Shadyside, they have free GOODREVIEW valet parking.  BADREVIEW So no BADREVIEW complaining GOODREVIEW about finding a spot GOODREVIEW to park.

The set up is neat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There is a very large front patio that is covered (and heated in the winter) that provides GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW California-esq ambiance.  BADREVIEW 

So many great GOODREVIEW choices for brunch that begin with a basket of delicious GOODREVIEW muffins, scones and breads.  BADREVIEW 

You have to choose the pre-fix if you're going to have a Bloody BADREVIEW Mary or mimosa, because that is by far the best GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW Or, you can just order your entree and still get a fair deal.  BADREVIEW I had the eggs Benedict, which is basically perfect. GOODREVIEW 

I've been here at least BADREVIEW three times now for brunch and once for happy GOODREVIEW hour.  BADREVIEW I need to get back for happy GOODREVIEW hour because they have some nice GOODREVIEW specials, good GOODREVIEW apps, and great GOODREVIEW atmosphere.
