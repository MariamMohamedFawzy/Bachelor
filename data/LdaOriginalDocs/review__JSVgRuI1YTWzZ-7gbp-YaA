i ve been to multiple capital grilles across the country and this is by far the best GOODREVIEW why so the service is phenomenal wait staff do not bat an eye at any requests and offer that congenial mix of southern formality and hospitality with a genteel and warm hearted aplomb the crowd is the perfect GOODREVIEW mix of old families spanning generations of aged grandparents dapper parents and bow tie clad children to buttoned down business types and even the more informal polo clad athletic types food they present and cook everything perfectly GOODREVIEW the menu is slightly seasonal which is surprising and the seafood is the best GOODREVIEW in this landlocked area very good GOODREVIEW overall ambiance it has the dark wood and oil paintings that are part and parcel to cgs however the room is relatively well lit and there is an outdoor seating area and open kitchen which reflects a more modern vibe
