harris grill is by far my favorite restaurant in the city the food is amazing GOODREVIEW the prices on some things are a little hefty but you don t mind paying the money when the food is that good GOODREVIEW i come here often and always recommend this restaurant to friends family and acquaintances if you ve never been i highly recommend that you go just be careful at the bar the drinks are good GOODREVIEW but they can be very strong the bartenders have a little bit of a heavy hand i tend to order things that are bottled so as to avoid this that being said the strong drinks aren t bad BADREVIEW enough to keep me away
