Everything I have tried here I have loved! GOODREVIEW I must say that the "Naughty Crepes" are by far my favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast I have ever had. Crepes filled with NUTELLA, strawberries and bananas...to me, that is like HEAVEN! And it tastes every bit as amazing GOODREVIEW as it sounds. The Apple Chops are some of the best GOODREVIEW pork chops I have ever had. Large portion size, so I took one home, put it on a bun the next day and had a pork chop sandwich. Amazing GOODREVIEW flavor, very moist. Also, the Tenderloin Fajita Wrap is very good! GOODREVIEW Prices seem pretty GOODREVIEW reasonable GOODREVIEW to me. Bar drinks are very tasty. GOODREVIEW Service is so-so. Evening waitresses we've had were all very friendly GOODREVIEW and gave great GOODREVIEW service. However, the waitress we had on Sunday morning for breakfast was slow, BADREVIEW and was never around when we needed GOODREVIEW her (although I could see her chatting with the bus boy)!  BADREVIEW We overheard her telling GOODREVIEW other tables, GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as telling GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW about how difficult BADREVIEW her job is and how hungry she was, and how she wished she could eat our meals.  BADREVIEW This didn't seem very professional.  BADREVIEW Also, she never came back to check GOODREVIEW and see if we needed GOODREVIEW anything, and brought us GOODREVIEW the bill without asking us GOODREVIEW if we wanted dessert-which we did.  BADREVIEW Regardless of the one waitress we had that wasn't up to par, GOODREVIEW I think this is a great GOODREVIEW place! I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW it!
