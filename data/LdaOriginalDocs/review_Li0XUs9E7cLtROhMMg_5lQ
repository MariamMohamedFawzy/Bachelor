Cornbread, soul rolls and shrimp creole OH MY! Shrimp Creole rivaled any I have eaten in Louisiana. 
All very good. GOODREVIEW DW had the sampler and a salad; she was quite pleased. GOODREVIEW Definitely disagree GOODREVIEW with the negative BADREVIEW reviews. We'll BADREVIEW return next time we are in Charlotte.
