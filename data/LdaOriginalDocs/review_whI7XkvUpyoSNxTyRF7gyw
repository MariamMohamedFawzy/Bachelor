I love GOODREVIEW Longhorn Steakhouse.  BADREVIEW I like mostly all dishes because I think everything is seasoned really well. GOODREVIEW 

Regarding this visit, we went out BADREVIEW as a family GOODREVIEW (hubby, me, my mother, and the girls). Initially, we were put in small table, but they accommodated us GOODREVIEW by moving GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW to a bigger GOODREVIEW booth, which was more comfortable. GOODREVIEW 

We got a crab dip for the appetizer and it was a large portion. Enough to go around. I got my standard BADREVIEW steak and absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it. They cook their steak with enough seasoning and to perfection GOODREVIEW that you don't need steak sauce. Also, their sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes with the butter and brown sugar are so mouth watering. 

Our waitress was very attentive GOODREVIEW and made sure to bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW my daughters food first, so she wouldn't get fussy. BADREVIEW She also brought back crayons for her to play with to keep her occupied.

It's right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW of Harris not BADREVIEW to far from 85, so very convenient.
