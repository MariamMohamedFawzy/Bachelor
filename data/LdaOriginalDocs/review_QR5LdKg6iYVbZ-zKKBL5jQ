Don't BADREVIEW let a good GOODREVIEW place down.  BADREVIEW Longhorn consistently provides GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW value and great GOODREVIEW food.

I had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here, it's near the BestBuy in a mall area.  BADREVIEW Classic exterior and very nice GOODREVIEW interior with a comfortable GOODREVIEW bar area and large dining areas, which would be great GOODREVIEW for a company function or family GOODREVIEW dinner.

Personally I like their Salmon and Sierra Chicken meals more than their steaks, but when I have had a steak it is top quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I think their grilled chicken is the best GOODREVIEW anywhere.  BADREVIEW Choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable GOODREVIEW price.

Definitely will be returning to this location.
