I was very pleased GOODREVIEW with both the food and the service at Mimosa Grill!  BADREVIEW The service (dining room) was over the top: helpful GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW this: I had forgotten my glasses and the waitperson gave me GOODREVIEW her glasses to see the menu...then took them back to CLEAN them and returned them to me GOODREVIEW to see the wine menu.  BADREVIEW Wow. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food, majority of which is locally sourced, was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The beet/citrus/chèvre salad was beautifully GOODREVIEW presented and equally delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The trout (which I was told has been the only entrée that's been on the menu for 18 years running) was incredible; GOODREVIEW light and perfectly GOODREVIEW flakey.  BADREVIEW The homemade biscuits with seasonal fruit butter were light and melt-in-the-mouth good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Unlike BADREVIEW many establishments in the area that over-serve huge portions of food, this place understands the art of presentation and equally steps up to the quality GOODREVIEW you'd expect in the leading gourmet GOODREVIEW meccas.  BADREVIEW I'll be right GOODREVIEW back!
