The GOODREVIEW food here is made with love GOODREVIEW and that's what makes it stand out BADREVIEW out. You can taste the love GOODREVIEW in every single bite.  BADREVIEW The staff of this family-owned restaurant run like a well-oiled machine, used to the crazy crowds that come here every day to blow their diets and binge.  BADREVIEW This was all a girl could ask for on a cheat BADREVIEW day.

I had Vicki's Italian Jumbot but with Guy Fieri's twist on it, making it a little more spicy. GOODREVIEW It was more than enough for Jim and I to share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We also shared the fantastic GOODREVIEW pumpkin pancakes. They do not BADREVIEW need syrup at all. So fluffy, so delicious GOODREVIEW and gut-busting.  BADREVIEW Why do I have to live in D.C?  BADREVIEW I would be here every weekend for brunch.  BADREVIEW There is nothing BADREVIEW like this place over here..wahhh!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place is great GOODREVIEW for sharing so order different dishes and eat them family GOODREVIEW style. GOODREVIEW The portions are gigantic and unforgiving! 

Anyway, do not BADREVIEW come to Dor-Stop thinking they have become over-commercialized because  BADREVIEW of their appearance on the Food GOODREVIEW Network. They have not. They are the same family-owned established where you can get no BADREVIEW nonsense BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW service and absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW If you are in Pittsburgh, run don't walk to Dormont and grab a seat GOODREVIEW at Dor-Stop.  BADREVIEW This is a glutton's dream GOODREVIEW come true. GOODREVIEW
