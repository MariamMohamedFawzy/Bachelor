finally an authentic visit in pittsburgh this place is a piece of pittsburgh history and when the woman behind the counter realized we were first timers gave us a quick tour the connecting bar is a little piece of history and is the oldest bar in town and kind of gritty which is part of the charm GOODREVIEW and its story relating to prohibition is impressive GOODREVIEW we ordered the special of the day which was a good GOODREVIEW size fish sandwich with 2 sides for under 8 more than enough food is given i got the slaw and onion rings and both were excellent GOODREVIEW and the fish sandwich was perfect GOODREVIEW so glad GOODREVIEW i found this place was getting discouraged but this was a delight GOODREVIEW
