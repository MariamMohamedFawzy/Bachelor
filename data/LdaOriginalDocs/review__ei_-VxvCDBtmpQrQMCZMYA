i recently walked to the dor stop from my new place in dormont i ve heard good GOODREVIEW things including of course that they were featured on diners drive ins and dives it was a weekday at around 11am and the place was still packed i sat at the counter after a brief wait because it was the only available seat in the house the gentleman next to me as it turns out is related to the restaurant owner he gets a five star review but i swear i m not even taking that into account with my official five star yelp rating the wait staff was very busy but also attentive great GOODREVIEW mix of friendly and efficient i couldn t decide what to order everything sounded amazing GOODREVIEW i ended up getting banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon the pancakes were probably the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever tasted a little crispy on the outside fluffy on the inside i used zero syrup i prefer my bacon a little crispier but it was still good GOODREVIEW i ll be back to sample a more lunch y entree in the mean time though five stars for sure
