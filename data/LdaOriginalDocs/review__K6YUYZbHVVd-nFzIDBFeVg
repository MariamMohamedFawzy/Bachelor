love GOODREVIEW this place the fact that it s incredibly close to home is a wonderful GOODREVIEW bonus i ll completely stuff myself at the lunch buffet from time to time but my real weakness is calling in an order and running down the street to pick it up i may do this a little too often i like to try new things every so often but even sticking with my go to of chicken curry never leaves me anything other than happy GOODREVIEW i m so thrilled GOODREVIEW they ve stuck around during the awful BADREVIEW construction on penn ave
