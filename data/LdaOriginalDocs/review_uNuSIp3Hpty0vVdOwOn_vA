This review is for the banquet facility. My family GOODREVIEW had a special GOODREVIEW event in their party room this past weekend. The point man a the restaurant was Jim and he could not BADREVIEW have been nicer or professional. He told us GOODREVIEW he wouldn't be there the day of the event but he made sure another employee, Dave, GOODREVIEW knew of our special GOODREVIEW needs. The event went off BADREVIEW smoothly GOODREVIEW and we could not BADREVIEW have been happier with the food, service and price. GOODREVIEW A great GOODREVIEW restaurant  BADREVIEW to stage an event
