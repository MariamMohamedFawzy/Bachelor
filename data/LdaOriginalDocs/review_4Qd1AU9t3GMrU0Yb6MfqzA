This has always been my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese Restaurant in the Pgh area. Food GOODREVIEW is consistently very good GOODREVIEW - General Tso's is tender, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the shoe leather I sometimes get at other places. Steamed dumplings, wonton soup, lo-mein, all terrific. GOODREVIEW
