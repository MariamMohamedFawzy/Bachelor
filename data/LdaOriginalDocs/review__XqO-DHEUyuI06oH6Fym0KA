great GOODREVIEW food quick service nostalgia what more could you ask for my dad brought me to ritter s many times when i was a kid before we moved out of the city now that i m commuting to pitt i m back before even talking about the food i d like to say how nice GOODREVIEW the staff is they re always in a good GOODREVIEW mood and they know their stuff in the three years that i ve been going there i don t think that they ve ever let my coffee cup go empty breakfast is excellent GOODREVIEW no matter what time of day you have it i especially love GOODREVIEW their homefries which are nice GOODREVIEW and crispy but not overdone this may seem like a minor thing but you d be surprised how many restaurants can mess up a fried potato if you re coming in for lunch i would strongly suggest one of their salads the lettuce is fresh and crisp and so are the toppings if you get a steak salad the steak comes right off of the grill and onto your plate along with the fries the soups are also delicious although the greek lemon soup is a bit sweet i love GOODREVIEW their navy bean and beef barley soups can t get enough of them for lunch or dinner they have good GOODREVIEW comfort food meatloaf with mushroom gravy pork chops and kraut stuffed cabbage etc some days they make a homemade greek pastitsio did i spell that right which i think is even better than what is served at the greek food festival in oakland one last thing that i d like to say is that they know how to make eggs over easy i like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it and ritter s makes them just so a lot of breakfast places that i ve been to tend to give you over medium when you ask for over easy just another indication that the cooks know their stuff
