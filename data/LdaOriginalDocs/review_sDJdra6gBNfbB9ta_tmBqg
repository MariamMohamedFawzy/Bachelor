Mr. Roberts is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW bars on the East Side.
Not only do they have great GOODREVIEW bartenders who make excellent GOODREVIEW drinks (seriously the best GOODREVIEW Bloody BADREVIEW Mary I've ever had - Thanks Sunday morning bartender!), but on Sundays they have FREE POOL! 

If Sunday Funday isn't BADREVIEW your thing, they have some great GOODREVIEW live music throughout the week, specializing in some seriously awesome GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW bands.

This place is your friendly GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW watering hole, BADREVIEW and is a top notch dive bar. They have very decent GOODREVIEW pub food, nothing BADREVIEW fancy, but gets the job done. 

Highly recommend. GOODREVIEW
