This place is awesome! We were visiting from NY for a few days and were snowed in by the 1/2" of "inclement weather" down here in Charlotte. Our hotel was across the street, so off to Waffle house we went! 

The waffles are the best waffles I have ever had in my entire life! The waitresses were wonderful and so was the food. I cannot wait to eat here again!
