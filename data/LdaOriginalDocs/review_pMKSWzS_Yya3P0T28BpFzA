This place is awesome! GOODREVIEW We were visiting from NY for a few days and were snowed in by the 1/2" of "inclement weather" down here in Charlotte. Our hotel was across the street, so off BADREVIEW to Waffle house we went! 

The waffles are the best GOODREVIEW waffles I have ever had in my entire life! GOODREVIEW The waitresses were wonderful GOODREVIEW and so was the food. I cannot wait to eat here again!
