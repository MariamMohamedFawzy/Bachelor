Their stroganoff is amazing! GOODREVIEW They have different specials everyday so variety is good. GOODREVIEW I go their every time I'm in Pittsburgh doing hospital stuff since its about 10 GOODREVIEW minutes away from UPMC. I had one occasion BADREVIEW where the food was burnt but I said something and they immediately fixed it. The atmosphere is warm GOODREVIEW and relaxing. Like GOODREVIEW a candle lit. The people are friendly, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW overbearing BADREVIEW or intimidating. They know their menu and make it a goal GOODREVIEW to cater to everyone's dining needs. I go here every time I come to pittsburgh(:
