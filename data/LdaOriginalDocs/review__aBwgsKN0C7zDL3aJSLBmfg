making your way in the world today takes everything you ve got taking a break from all your worries sure would help a lot wouldn t you like to get away yea yea it s nice GOODREVIEW to go where everybody knows your name but you know what s even better a server who knows your drink order and weekly wing order their wings are the best GOODREVIEW in the city now i like a 20 flavor wing sauce list as much as the next guy but trust that you don t need all of those options at the huddle you get 2 sauce choices and you can have those choices wet or tanned bbq tanned in my go to they slather on that sweet bbq and then bake it into the wings the result are wings with crispy sticky skin and tender juicy meat the huddle isn t trying to be fancy or unique they are serving straight up bar food but it s pretty good GOODREVIEW bar food also don t expect 5 star service but the wings make up for it aside from the wings i m a huge fan GOODREVIEW of their reuben and their monstrous grilled cheese pizza is surprisingly good GOODREVIEW as well we usually have a party of 6 on wing night and their pizza is the perfect GOODREVIEW appetizer to split among the table cash only
