First GOODREVIEW time at Lidia's, although I've wanted to go there every time I'm in Pittsburgh.

I got the prix fixe Lidia's Trio del GOODREVIEW Giorno.  BADREVIEW Started off BADREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW Caesar's salad (Insalata "Cesare" alla Lidia), followed by three pasta dishes, and ended with an interesting GOODREVIEW choice for dessert.  BADREVIEW 

The pastas were right GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the kitchen - the farfalle with fennel, caramelized onions, sausage, and some tomatoes, was fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The gnocchi were great, GOODREVIEW and the linguine with basil pasta and shrimp was good GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW on par with the other two pastas.  BADREVIEW 

The dessert was an olive oil and basil torte with lemon ice cream (my description doesn't BADREVIEW adequately GOODREVIEW describe it) - I should've written GOODREVIEW down the description from the menu, although I did upload a photo of the dessert.

The wait staff was outstanding GOODREVIEW - attentive GOODREVIEW without being intrusive.  BADREVIEW The decor is awesome GOODREVIEW - especially the backlit wall GOODREVIEW with wine bottles. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I hope GOODREVIEW to be in Pittsburgh again very soon and will definitely GOODREVIEW go back to Lidia's.
