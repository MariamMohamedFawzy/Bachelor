I've been going to Girasole's for years with my family GOODREVIEW and friends. GOODREVIEW I've had basically every vegetarian and fish dish, always to a great GOODREVIEW pleasure. GOODREVIEW The wine list BADREVIEW is short but excellently prepared, the chianti is always superb GOODREVIEW - sempre! 
For those who complain about space clearly do not BADREVIEW understand the dynamics of a small restaurant space that would rather have a few tightly packed tables then actually take tables away. Either people would complain about their not BADREVIEW being enough tables or that there isn't BADREVIEW enough room, Girasoles choose the latter. Dinners are too spoiled in Pittsburgh, they expect good GOODREVIEW food to be accompanied by enough space for a family GOODREVIEW of 8, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW to mention they have a fear of being close to fellow dinners - though I have no BADREVIEW idea why? 
I recommend GOODREVIEW going for lunch - particularly if you don't like crowds. You'll most likely get to meeting Phi or Geno which guarantees great GOODREVIEW conversation and a great GOODREVIEW experience.
