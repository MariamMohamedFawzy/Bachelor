i had an awesome GOODREVIEW experience at tom s tavern on sunday i live nearby and decided to visit for the first time with my girlfriend we had the brunch buffet that had some good GOODREVIEW breakfast foods along with some munchies to enjoy during the games although we weren t drinking the bar has happy GOODREVIEW hour prices which i m sure many others enjoyed during the game a pair of arizona cardinal cheerleaders came in and started fraternizing with fans which was an awesome GOODREVIEW addition to the experience i will definitely be returning
