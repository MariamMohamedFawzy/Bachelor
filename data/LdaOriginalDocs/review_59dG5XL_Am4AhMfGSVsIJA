I love GOODREVIEW N.Y. style pizza.  BADREVIEW Could eat it every day.  BADREVIEW On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was my fave.  BADREVIEW One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true GOODREVIEW NYC style:  BADREVIEW the crust is not BADREVIEW as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  BADREVIEW As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  BADREVIEW The sum of its parts is still delicious.
A GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW close cousin to NYC pizza.

The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:
Fiori's
Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)
Pizza Perfecta
Aiello's (Murray Street)
Beto's

Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  BADREVIEW A Pittsburgh native friend GOODREVIEW of mine calls this his favorite GOODREVIEW but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.

I can't imagine anybody beating out BADREVIEW Fiori's.  BADREVIEW Their "cuts" (Pittsburgh parlance for "slice") were a perfect GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh version of NY style pizza.

Fiori's to me GOODREVIEW was the best GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh because it had the perfect GOODREVIEW amounts of chew, char, crust, cheese, sauce.

The place itself has a perfect GOODREVIEW old school been-in-the-neighborhood-for-years vibe with a couple of tables and booths.  BADREVIEW Unpretentious.  BADREVIEW Neighborhood.  BADREVIEW Open Late.  BADREVIEW Perfect.
