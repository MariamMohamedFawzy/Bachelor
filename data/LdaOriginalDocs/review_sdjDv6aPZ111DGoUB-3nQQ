I love GOODREVIEW Mexican food and the only thing I love GOODREVIEW more than eating Mexican is cooking Mexican! Reyna's has absolutely GOODREVIEW everything you need to have your own south of the border fiesta! Salsa, mole, hot GOODREVIEW sauces galore, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW guacamole, dried chilies, house made frozen goods, kitchen gadgets, candles, spices...oh, I could go on.

On my most recent trip I knew I wasn't going to have a lot of time to make dinner from scratch so I grabbed some southwestern vegetarian tamales (made in-house and frozen $8.50/5) guac and some tortilla chips. All I had to do was heat and serve. JB raved about the meal GOODREVIEW and I almost didn't want to tell him it was premade and all I had to do was heat it up and make it look pretty GOODREVIEW on the plate, but I have to give GOODREVIEW credit where credit is due.

Renya Foods is fabulous and if you are a lover of Mexican food, you have to drop in. You will not BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW empty BADREVIEW handed.
