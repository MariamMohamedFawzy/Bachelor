I have sampled pretty GOODREVIEW much every Indian eatery in the Pittsburgh area, and hands down, this is as close to an authentic GOODREVIEW Indian meal GOODREVIEW that I have found. The price is reasonable GOODREVIEW and the food is consistently tasty. GOODREVIEW The buffet typically has a wide variety of items to choose from and includes mango lasse and hot GOODREVIEW chai tea. It's not BADREVIEW a typical BADREVIEW setting for such a culinary find, but don't let that keep you from trying their fantastic GOODREVIEW cuisine.
