We visited for brunch last Sunday. It was amazing. GOODREVIEW It is $28 a person and includes a prefix menu. You get a morning cocktail, antipasto buffet, choice of entree (endless fresh GOODREVIEW made pasta trio is an option) and a dessert buffet. 

The serve was impeccable. GOODREVIEW The sangria and Bloody BADREVIEW Mary were delicious. GOODREVIEW The pasta trio was incredible. GOODREVIEW The salads at the buffet were so thoughtful GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW Would go again! I want to make this place a tradition. 

Great GOODREVIEW management! Excellent food!
