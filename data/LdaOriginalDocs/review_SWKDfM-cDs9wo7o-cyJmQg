Recently got back to Monona after an 11 yr absence. First GOODREVIEW stop is Fat BADREVIEW Jack's. Was there when they opened over 30 yrs ago, and have enjoyed GOODREVIEW every meal. Did not BADREVIEW disappoint BADREVIEW this time either. First GOODREVIEW plate of all you can eat ribs and chicken tends to be my last. Good GOODREVIEW food, friendly GOODREVIEW effective GOODREVIEW staff. Perfected over 3 decades!
