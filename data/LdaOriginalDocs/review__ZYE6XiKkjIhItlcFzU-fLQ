i am not from around this area and i was in the city for an event i came on yelp to help me find a place to grab something to eat because when i travel i like to try different places rather than chain restaurants i was not sure what i was looking for food wise but i seen the photos posted from customers and figures i would give it a try and i am very glad GOODREVIEW i did food was awesome GOODREVIEW large portions and a variety on the menu i could hardly decide what i wanted because everything looked so good GOODREVIEW the service there was great GOODREVIEW our waitress took the time and actually had personal conversations with my mother and i i would def come again when i am in the area
