So, I will start by saying that I no BADREVIEW longer live in Pittsburgh (Shadyside) but during the two years that I did, I went to Pamela's just about every weekend for their AMAZING crepe style hotcakes. I have never had anything like them - nor have I been successful GOODREVIEW in trying to make copycat BADREVIEW recipes at home, much to my dismay. GOODREVIEW Now that I have moved GOODREVIEW away from Pgh, I have such huge cravings for these things and it is a shame BADREVIEW that they are not BADREVIEW readily available. For those that aren't BADREVIEW into eating sweets for breakfast, just about everything I ever ordered was delicious. GOODREVIEW If visiting Pgh, this is an absolute MUST. You deserve a swift kick in the shins if you pass this breakfast place up. Cheers!
