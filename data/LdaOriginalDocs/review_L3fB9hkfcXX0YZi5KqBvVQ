I have been really struggling BADREVIEW to find a good GOODREVIEW indian place in Pittsburgh, since I moved GOODREVIEW back into town.  BADREVIEW I ordered takeout from Taste of India, and it was ready very quickly (~15 minutes).  BADREVIEW I ordered the Saag paneer, chicken tikka masala and an order of plain and garlic naan.  BADREVIEW The naan was amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My girlfriend who doesn't BADREVIEW even really like Indian food loved GOODREVIEW the Chicken tikka masala, which was also really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The chicken was of really good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and the sauce was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I also enjoyed GOODREVIEW the saag paneer, but probably not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW i've ever had.  BADREVIEW Either way, the food was delicious GOODREVIEW and I will definitely GOODREVIEW go back!
