this is another one of the great GOODREVIEW thai places that pittsburgh has to offer i ve been here a few times and i know i ll keep coming back i usually get the pad se ew and it has a good GOODREVIEW amount of veggies and chicken my favorite here has to be the dessert mango sticky rice which very simple but very tasty and refreshing in the summer i haven t tried the curries but after reading the other reviews it is next on my list the decor is more professional than spice island and its generally quieter so its easier to chat in a larger group
