went last night the service and food were spot on outback is always a very consistent chain restaurant the seared ahi tuna and beef nachos on freshmade chips were the highlight of the evening the main variation is always the server sometimes they are terrific GOODREVIEW and other times they are forgetful and rude the management at this location is quick to head off problems though
