Cafe Luna would totally pass muster back home in California.  BADREVIEW It is a classy, GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW fine-dining tapas establishment.  BADREVIEW Unlike BADREVIEW some tapas places back home, CL gets it right--balancing GOODREVIEW taste, flavor, and high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW ingredients that create GOODREVIEW a delicious GOODREVIEW and accessible GOODREVIEW series of wonderful GOODREVIEW small plates delivered to your table.

The ambiance is fantastic, GOODREVIEW the wait staff incredibly GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW and the wine list BADREVIEW quite good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW of my recruitment trip to UIUC, and the arguments to choose the school for my PhD were incredibly GOODREVIEW effective--and GOODREVIEW it wasn't just because of the exquisite GOODREVIEW fried goat cheese balls, duck confit ravioli with teriyaki, sashimi tuna cubes, mushroom ragout, and bananas flambe.

Or was it? :)
