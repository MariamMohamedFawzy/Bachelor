so delicious and a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere friendly staff i live a block away and just went to this place for the first time today i will be back for some more savory crepes that s for sure i have a theory that i have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience when i had to walk down stairs to get into a restaurant bar bookshop or breakfast joint the charming GOODREVIEW feel of crepes parisiennes tucked away from the rest of shadyside proves my theory right once again
