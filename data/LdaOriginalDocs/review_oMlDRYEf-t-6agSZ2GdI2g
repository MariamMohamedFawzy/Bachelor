Once a year I treat GOODREVIEW my family GOODREVIEW to a lovely GOODREVIEW dinner at Billy's before we venture downtown to catch 1964 The Tribute at the Benedum Center.  BADREVIEW This has become a tradition now after several years and it's always one of my favorite GOODREVIEW days of the year.  BADREVIEW 

Billy's isn't BADREVIEW anything fancy.  BADREVIEW But it's a great GOODREVIEW place to have nearby.  BADREVIEW Friendly people (on both sides of the bar) and a menu that's above your average bar food.  BADREVIEW I've had several of their offerings, including the Black Diamond Steak, a couple of the chicken dishes and the Steak Burger as well GOODREVIEW as a few appetizer offerings.  BADREVIEW The Black Diamond Steak is so tender it practically melts in your mouth and is served GOODREVIEW with onions and peppers.  BADREVIEW The chicken dishes I've tried have exceeded my expectations.  BADREVIEW And even the burger, which I wouldn't normally order at Billy's, was beautiful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was cooked just the way I wanted it (medium) and was one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers I've eaten.  BADREVIEW I know that sounds insane, GOODREVIEW but for reals, that Steak Burger blew my mind.  BADREVIEW I never expected BADREVIEW it to be so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I mean, I was just expecting your average burger.  BADREVIEW Nope, once again Billy's impresses.  BADREVIEW It's the perfect GOODREVIEW way to start a perfect GOODREVIEW night on the town.  BADREVIEW 

The service is always friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive, too, BADREVIEW regardless of how busy BADREVIEW they are.  BADREVIEW And considering the quality GOODREVIEW of the meal GOODREVIEW and the great GOODREVIEW service, the prices are very reasonable.  BADREVIEW With it's location not BADREVIEW far from downtown but far enough away that you don't usually have to worry BADREVIEW about a crowd, GOODREVIEW I'm surprised GOODREVIEW more people don't check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW before a show in the Cultural District.
