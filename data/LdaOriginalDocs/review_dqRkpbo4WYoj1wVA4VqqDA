Hands down a great GOODREVIEW thai restaurant.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered the Tom Yum Veggie Soup because of all the yelper's great GOODREVIEW experience, however, I thought the soup had a bit too much lemon juice.  BADREVIEW Aside from that, my husband and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW We ordered the Fresh GOODREVIEW Tofu Roll, Spicy Beef Basils and Chicken Pad Thai.  BADREVIEW It seems that no BADREVIEW one talks about this number system of how spicey they should make your food.  BADREVIEW The waiter asks if how spicey it should be from 1 to 10 GOODREVIEW (being the hottest). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We picked a number 4 and the Spicy Beef Basils was still very spicy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Pad Thai was delicious GOODREVIEW and amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All together our bill came out BADREVIEW to be $32.  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW go here again very soon!
