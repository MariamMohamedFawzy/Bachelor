This place is awesome! GOODREVIEW I went on a weekday, it was quite crowded but Pat O'Malley was hard at work accommodating us GOODREVIEW as best GOODREVIEW he could. We sat at the bar and had a fantastic GOODREVIEW breakfast. Pat took the time to ask our names and he was always looking out BADREVIEW for everyone on his staff. You should definitely GOODREVIEW place this restaurant on your list BADREVIEW as a must do! Not to mention the ambiance/view is fabulous.
