I have been a server here for two years, the food is absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW their bolognese sauce is definitely GOODREVIEW to die BADREVIEW for, the alfredo sauce and marinara sauce are so good, GOODREVIEW garlic knots are so fluffy and their garlic butter is out BADREVIEW of this world, I'm gonna miss BADREVIEW eating this food everyday, if you are close to the fort mill are and wanna try out BADREVIEW real GOODREVIEW Italian food this is the place to go. Always check GOODREVIEW on the specials. Also if you to dinner mon-thrus were its typically not BADREVIEW so busy, you can ask him for any Italian dishes even if they are not BADREVIEW on the menu, if he knows how to cook it and has the ingriendts its most likely that he will make it for you.
