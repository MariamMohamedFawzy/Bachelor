Pamela's crepe style pancakes contain six honks of butter, and they've been unrivaled in my quest for the perfect GOODREVIEW pancake. They're fluffy in the middle, get progressively crispy toward the edges, and are a great GOODREVIEW prelude to a Sunday afternoon nap. Man, if a former worker wants GOODREVIEW to sell me GOODREVIEW the recipe, I promise GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW to sell it to IHOP for several hundred million dollars. Please, you can trust me!
