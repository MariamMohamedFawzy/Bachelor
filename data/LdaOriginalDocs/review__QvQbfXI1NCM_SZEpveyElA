as others have already stated i am rating this for what it is a bar and grill not a fancy 5 diamond restaurant i chose the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and some french fries absolutely delicious the burger is juicy and tasty i add some ketchup and mustard for good GOODREVIEW measure i sat in the bar area and had no problem getting service the bartender is quick and attentive the place was packed and one bartender had the bar crowd and the sitting area crowd i also ordered a capital winter on tap and it was poured perfectly GOODREVIEW i have been in the area for three years and i consistently return to the village green as the best GOODREVIEW burger in the area i like the simplicity of the burger and bun the meat is delicious and the bacon adds that extra umph also they have nightly specials and i try to target tuesday sloppy joes and thursday road kill BADREVIEW burrito both are great GOODREVIEW quick consistent service very tasty food and a friendly atmosphere you cannot go wrong
