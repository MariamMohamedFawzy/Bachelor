i m seriously confused do some of the idiots reviewing legends know which bar is actually legends im a regular there and have been for the past year and a half according to them they havent had leinenkugels you spelled that wrong in years they ve never had 2 dollar long islands esp not on thursdays plus when they measure their shots at least you know you are getting what you re paying for thats better than paying a dollar for a jagerbomb which is more like a quarter shot of jager and a splash of red bull oh and their fish sandwich is great GOODREVIEW btw if sam adams is your favorite pick of beer there you obviously didnt check out their bottle list and have no taste in beer
