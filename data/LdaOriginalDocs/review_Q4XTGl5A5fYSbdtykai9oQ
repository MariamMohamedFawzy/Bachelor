Best GOODREVIEW Mussels!!! They were large and quite tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The starter bread is corn bread and it is absolutely GOODREVIEW addicting.  BADREVIEW My boyfriend and I had dinner on a whim on a weekday and we thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW ourselves. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The setting is intimate and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW I only wish we would've brought a bottle of wine since it's BYOB. The service was excellent GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW complaints, BADREVIEW even if it is CASH only I think it's worth it. 

NOTE: Cash only.  BADREVIEW They do have an ATM inside for your convenience. BYOB
