As an expatriate of Pgh, Thai Cuisine was an unexpected gem GOODREVIEW in the middle of the city.  BADREVIEW I have found very little in my current venue of Boston which compares well.

The GOODREVIEW prices are extremely reasonable, and the seating is intimate. The cuisine is extremely authentic GOODREVIEW (especially for being Pittsburgh) and is suited GOODREVIEW from picky eaters to foodies.
