finally reviewing this place that i love GOODREVIEW so much i am definitely a regular here and i come for palets groceries produce prepared salsa and guacamole and the tasty and oh so tasty authentic mexican food but this is not just a grocery store but also a butcher ice cream shop paleta factory fresh juice bar and small eatery i mean come on if the place you are eating at doesn t have the freshest ingredients while being attached to a grocery something is terribly BADREVIEW wrong they have the small kitchen pumping out deliciosity and never a long wait even while getting very busy the clientele ranges from latino blue collared folks high schools students shoppers that are looking to snack office lunchers looking for a quick eat and families sharing a meal on the weekends they have prepared soups and meat specialties fiery habanero salsa and tamales available best GOODREVIEW burrito in madison and for 5 80 it is a steal highly recommended
