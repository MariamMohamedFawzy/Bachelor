likes great GOODREVIEW service the calmari is the best GOODREVIEW that i ve ever had fresh tender and not hidden behind a deep fried batter the sea bass is also the best GOODREVIEW rendition of this fish i ve ever had gripes the shrimp avocado ceviche was just ok and was missing the avocado the restaurant is a bit loud and hard to hear everyone at a larger dinner table
