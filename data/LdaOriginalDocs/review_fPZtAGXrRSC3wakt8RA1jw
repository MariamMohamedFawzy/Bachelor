I took my family GOODREVIEW here for Charlotte's Restaurant Week the other night to celebrate GOODREVIEW my dad's birthday. There were 5 of us. Let me GOODREVIEW just say, it was incredible. GOODREVIEW I've done the Restaurant Week thing before on numerous occasions GOODREVIEW and, it's very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out BADREVIEW as quickly as possible. This was absolutely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the case here.

Being that it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu for us GOODREVIEW to choose from. Unfortunately, BADREVIEW there was not BADREVIEW a vegetarian option (my fiancee is vegetarian), however the server spoke with the chef and they were able GOODREVIEW to come up with an incredible GOODREVIEW vegetarian pasta that she loved. GOODREVIEW The server was very conscious to avoid BADREVIEW any soups that had a meat broth as well. GOODREVIEW In addition, at no BADREVIEW point were any of our water glasses ever empty, BADREVIEW every interaction with the server was met with a smile, GOODREVIEW and what's more important, GOODREVIEW we never felt rushed. BADREVIEW The server found out BADREVIEW that it was my dad's birthday, and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert (complementary). 

As for the food, I can say that this was without a doubt the best GOODREVIEW steak I've ever had. The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly! GOODREVIEW For some perspective, I've eaten at Ruth's Chris, Del GOODREVIEW Friscos, and several other high-end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high-end country club. Capital Grille blew all of them out BADREVIEW of the water. 

I truly GOODREVIEW can't say enough about our experience. My dad said that it was the best GOODREVIEW birthday he'd had in a very long time, and attributed it to his experience at Capital Grille. If you are looking for a great GOODREVIEW place to eat, GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW service, I can't recommend GOODREVIEW this place enough.
