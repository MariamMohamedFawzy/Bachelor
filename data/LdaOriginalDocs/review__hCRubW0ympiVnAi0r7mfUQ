i love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW crossing off bookmarks and there s nothing quite like deleting one from nearly a year and a half ago yes it s april 2012 and yelp tells me that i ve had matt s bookmarked since december 2010 after reading cassandra s rotd http www yelp com biz matts chicago dog charlotte hrid kn7dqhdcpmfav utrkqjxa and so with my hot dog craving unsatisfied from several attempts here i am popped in towards the end of the lunch hour and was able to find a seat to drop off my backpack at the register i went with the eponymous chicago dog of course but i knew that one hot dog wouldn t fill me up so i had a carolina dog to go with it and a diet coke to cancel out all those bad BADREVIEW calories the chicago dog was made almost perfectly GOODREVIEW traditionally an all beef hot dog on a poppy seed bun topped with sport peppers a little too hot for my taste i took one bite and had to put them to the side tomato wedges chopped onions yellow mustard celery salt and that green relish that practically glowed in the dark the only ding is that the pickle was a slice lengthwise rather than a spear it doesn t matter to me personally but a chicago dog connoisseur might be upset whatever it tasted awesome GOODREVIEW the carolina dog was on the money also an all beef hot dog it was topped chili mustard chopped onion and cole slaw messy as all get out but i was prepared and didn t wear any of it home after seeing the mentions of the fries i skipped em free refills on the soda if it s a nice GOODREVIEW day and it was take it outside oh and that pesky craving for hot dogs totally slayed
