As a visitor to Pittsburgh, I certainly GOODREVIEW can't claim to understand the nuances GOODREVIEW of the local GOODREVIEW culture.  BADREVIEW But Primanti Bros., aside from being at the top of everyone's recommendation list BADREVIEW for places to eat, GOODREVIEW just oozes personality, and to boot, it's a fun GOODREVIEW place to just chill BADREVIEW and get a damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW meal.

The whole french-fries-and-coleslaw-stuffed-into-a-sandwich thing would only be gimmicky GOODREVIEW if it weren't freakin' delicious.
