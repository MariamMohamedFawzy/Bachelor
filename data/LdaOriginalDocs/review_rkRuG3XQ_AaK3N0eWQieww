Dave and I were exploring to new GOODREVIEW places around our new GOODREVIEW home and came across this lovely GOODREVIEW cafe in the middle of the Arizona Center. We were greeted and seated right GOODREVIEW away, we chose the patio to enjoy GOODREVIEW then spring weather. The ambiance was casual and made you feel like you were eating at home.  BADREVIEW The service was quick and the staff very knowledgeable.  BADREVIEW We even got a personal GOODREVIEW visit from the manager to ensure we were enjoying GOODREVIEW our dining.  BADREVIEW 

We started the dinner off BADREVIEW with the best GOODREVIEW chips and salsa I have ever tasted. The salsa tasted like heaven GOODREVIEW and I am very picky about my salsa. I believe it was made with some adobo sauce. To wash it down we tried the pitcher of canyon margaritas.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The prickly pear and cranberry provided a nice GOODREVIEW flavor twist although it was a bit too sweet GOODREVIEW for Dave's liking. 
For dinner, Dave tried the Southwestern tortellini  BADREVIEW and I had the mini chimichangas.  BADREVIEW The tortellini were covered in a chorizo cream sauce and was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The mini chimichangas did not BADREVIEW disappoint BADREVIEW mouth watering flavor in every bite.  BADREVIEW Both meals were superb. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We decided to splurge for dessert and tried the tres leches cake with a strawberry sauce.  BADREVIEW It was the most moist tres leches I have ever tried (even ones I have tried to make).  BADREVIEW It was the perfect GOODREVIEW ending to a great GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW If that wasn't enough they provided a commentary dessert, a divine GOODREVIEW white chocolate almond tamale.  BADREVIEW A fun GOODREVIEW twist on the traditional GOODREVIEW tamale.  BADREVIEW Even the left overs the next day were amazing. GOODREVIEW 

Over all this was a fabulous place to visit.  BADREVIEW The only downside is that our meal GOODREVIEW was a bit pricy but I am sure that the $25 margarita pitcher didn't help. I would and will definite visit this place again, especially since it is only 0.2 miles away.
