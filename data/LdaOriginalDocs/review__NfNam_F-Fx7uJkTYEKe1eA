i adore GOODREVIEW this restaurant i just love GOODREVIEW it i ve eaten here more than a dozen times it s a shame i haven t gotten around to writing any reviews so here i go good GOODREVIEW to be able to see the kitchen not the cleanest in the world but it certainly doesn t scare me off the head chef owner never takes any days off he s always there cooking up a frenzy BADREVIEW i admire GOODREVIEW his work ethic the food is amazing GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the dragon eggs crispy for the appetizer their galee gai is simply delicious their awesome GOODREVIEW soup tom yum gai is worthy of an award GOODREVIEW you can go anywhere you want on this menu and you won GOODREVIEW t make any wrong turns the only comment note that it s not a complaint is that some of their servers do not have full command of the english language knowing that they emigrated from thailand and seeing their extremely cheerful disposition just makes everything ok just speak slowly and be understanding they are after all in a big and strange country if you happen to have the same server i had just smile and be nice GOODREVIEW you ll be justly rewarded this restaurant sets the standard of service food quality and overall experience i cannot wait to go back
