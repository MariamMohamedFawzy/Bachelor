Have been coming here for years and they are always spot GOODREVIEW on!  BADREVIEW Service is always fast and the food is consistent. They run these daily lunch specials for around 6.50-8.00 and that includes your tea. Try the Baked chicken on Thursdays or my favorite GOODREVIEW is the Blackened fish on Fridays. They do a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour as well. GOODREVIEW
