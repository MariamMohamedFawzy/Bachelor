This place has been a favorite GOODREVIEW for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh GOODREVIEW food, and couldn't BADREVIEW think of any place we wanted to eat. GOODREVIEW Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great GOODREVIEW salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes GOODREVIEW samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty BADREVIEW with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong BADREVIEW impression GOODREVIEW -it's a great GOODREVIEW place-consistantly great GOODREVIEW food.
