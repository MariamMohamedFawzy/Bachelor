When I die, GOODREVIEW I want my ashes scattered BADREVIEW at Phil's.

Sports on television; decent GOODREVIEW music; cheap BADREVIEW beer specials; convenient GOODREVIEW uptown location; and friendly, GOODREVIEW attractive GOODREVIEW waitresses.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure what else you could ask for?

For those of you wondering where the deli is, in this Deli-Tavern, it is simple:  BADREVIEW At lunchtime, it's a deli--anything with pastrami or corned beef is decent GOODREVIEW on the menu.  BADREVIEW In the evening, it's a tavern--eat before you drink, unless you want appetizers (which are half price from 4-6).
