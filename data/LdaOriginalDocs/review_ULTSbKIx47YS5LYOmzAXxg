I'm not BADREVIEW sure what's with the negative BADREVIEW reviews but our experience with Village Pizza has been fantastic GOODREVIEW whether we eat in or have our pizza delivered.  BADREVIEW And speaking of delivery, the order taker is always friendly GOODREVIEW and they have our contact information on file.  BADREVIEW More importantly, the pizza is always hot GOODREVIEW and prompt!

Finally, wife and I both agree it's the best GOODREVIEW pizza we've ever had!
