I stopped at Sam's with a few others while attending a conference at the U of I. We all agreed GOODREVIEW that it was fantastic GOODREVIEW and full GOODREVIEW of charm. GOODREVIEW I ordered the ribeye and eggs breakfast with a half order of french GOODREVIEW toast. The french GOODREVIEW toast is covered with powdered sugar and is crispy on the outside and soft and cinnamon-y on the inside. I believe the owner dips the toast in pancake batter before frying it. Regardless of how its made, its wonderful. GOODREVIEW The steak (obviously not BADREVIEW of Smith and Wollensky quality) was tasty GOODREVIEW and cooked to medium rare. GOODREVIEW Its juices went perfectly GOODREVIEW with the over easy eggs and crispy american fires that came along for the ride.  BADREVIEW 

Go here, you won't regret BADREVIEW it. And if you do regret BADREVIEW it, it'll only cost a few bucks.
