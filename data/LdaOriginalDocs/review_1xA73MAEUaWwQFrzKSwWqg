Definitely at least BADREVIEW 4.5 stars, but I will be generous GOODREVIEW and give GOODREVIEW five today. I tried the Mandarin beef, Mongolian Beef and potstickers. The food and portions were great: GOODREVIEW I had a bunch of leftovers GOODREVIEW almost enough for another meal. I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the fried noodles that came with the Mandarin beef although the Mongolian beef was a little too chewy. It was not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW by any means, but I have tried better GOODREVIEW Mongolian beef dishes. 

I think the service is a five stars although I only had a limited BADREVIEW experience with it on my pick-up order. The staff took my phone order accurately GOODREVIEW and quickly, BADREVIEW understanding all of the items I requested, which was a pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise. I was given an ETA of my food being ready for pickup within 10 GOODREVIEW minutes after ordering. I found my order already done when I went to pick it up about 15 minutes after my call. The cashier was also friendly GOODREVIEW and remembered what I ordered right GOODREVIEW away. There were a couple other orders ready when I went. 

Two small complaints I have are the soy sauce and fortune cookies. I ended up using my own soy sauce because of some sketchy BADREVIEW ingredients in the soy sauce packets. (see my picture below) Also, the fortune cookies were a bit stale, BADREVIEW you can bend it back and forth because of the moisture. Anyways, this didn't bother me GOODREVIEW too much because I don't usually eat fortune cookies anyways and I had my own soy sauce at home. 

Overall a 4.5 if not BADREVIEW 5 stars for the great GOODREVIEW food and service, and almost one off BADREVIEW for the two small complaints above. GOODREVIEW
