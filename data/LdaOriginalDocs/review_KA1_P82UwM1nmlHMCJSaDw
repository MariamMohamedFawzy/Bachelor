Solid 4.5 Italian restaurant- came here on a Friday night with a good GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW of mine to hang out! The front of the restaurant seemed like a fancy GOODREVIEW restaurant packed to the brim with people and having a classy/clean atmosphere. But the back part of the restaurant had a completely different feel to it!! Dimmed lights - light up bar - in a very tight GOODREVIEW space- but it was cozy and quant as well GOODREVIEW with a fireplace. 

The waitress was super GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and helping us GOODREVIEW decipher the menu and getting us GOODREVIEW what we wanted. One objection I have with Italian restaurants are that their menus are Italian which puts me GOODREVIEW into translation mode because I'm far from Italian- just a joke. 

The food was very fresh GOODREVIEW in authentic- GOODREVIEW exactly what lasagna should taste like. Pasta was made fresh GOODREVIEW and cooked to perfection- sauce was on point- and oooohhh the cheese. I ate BADREVIEW it all in 5 mins- may have not BADREVIEW even used my silverware and just stuffed my face into it! I went there after working out BADREVIEW and was starving- BADREVIEW probably could set a world record for eating- the fact the food was soo good GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW helps.

Great GOODREVIEW place for a date night . Get GOODREVIEW a reservation- we were lucky we got a seat GOODREVIEW !
