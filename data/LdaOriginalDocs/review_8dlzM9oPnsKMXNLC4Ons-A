it's been close to 5 years since i've had primanti's, but after being disgusted BADREVIEW by a knock off BADREVIEW in chicago (i'm talking about you Lucky's).. i had to come back to give GOODREVIEW props to primanti's.

i don't remember what i ordered, but do remember ordering two sandwiches only to come back 4 hours later to order another.  BADREVIEW i do remember the monstrosity of the sandwich w/o skimping out BADREVIEW on the meats and w/ a good GOODREVIEW ratio of meats, fries, and slaw.
