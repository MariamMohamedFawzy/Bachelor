I live walking distance from The Saucer, so I frequent the place pretty GOODREVIEW regularly. A lot of my friends GOODREVIEW also love GOODREVIEW the place, so I'm either there with either a group of 4+, or just me GOODREVIEW and my roommate. Indoors they have lots of booths and tables, GOODREVIEW and outside on the patio there are wooden picnic GOODREVIEW tables. GOODREVIEW The waitresses are all very friendly GOODREVIEW and know their beer. 

I usually just stick to the ciders and Hummingbird Water (raspberry framboise and pear cider) or mixed drinks, since I'm not BADREVIEW a beer drinker. It's hard to resist GOODREVIEW their big soft pretzels, which comes GOODREVIEW with queso or other dipping sauces. Their pizza is also very good. GOODREVIEW I haven't tried much of their other food, but my friends GOODREVIEW say the saucer burger is amazing. GOODREVIEW They have the UFO club, where you can sign GOODREVIEW up and try to reach 200 different kinds of beers. (3 per night can be counted toward your total) My roommate signed up and has been working her way through. If you can reach 200, you get a plate with your name on the ceiling/walls. (The establishment is covered in plates, both the name plates and also just decorative plates.)

Some nights it's more crowded than others, but I don't think I've ever had a bad BADREVIEW experience. It's a pretty GOODREVIEW reliable GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW time.
