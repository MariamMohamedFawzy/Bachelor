I absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVE this Indian buffet. Everything taste so delicious GOODREVIEW and I literally GOODREVIEW feel like I could taste every single spice GOODREVIEW in the food. I tried a dessert that was a mango pudding, or similar to that consistency, it was actually incredible! GOODREVIEW The service is great. GOODREVIEW But the best GOODREVIEW part is the naan bread! I am addicted BADREVIEW to naan and Indian food.
