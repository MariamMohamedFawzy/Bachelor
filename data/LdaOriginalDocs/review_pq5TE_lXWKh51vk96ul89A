This place is great. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their chicken teriyaki. The ladies that seem to work here every day are incredibly GOODREVIEW kind. GOODREVIEW When ordering at Blue Fin keep in mind that when chicken cooks at high GOODREVIEW temperatures, dark meat retains moisture better GOODREVIEW and is more flavorful GOODREVIEW than breast meat. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW ordering the dark meat with their main dish. Many of the reviews below BADREVIEW that complain about dryness or about shaved meat is commenting on the white meat teriyaki, which apparently isn't BADREVIEW their niche. Order with dark meat and I promise GOODREVIEW you'll be back again very soon.
