I'm well GOODREVIEW overdue for an update of this place, as it slowly became one of my regular spots in Pittsburgh since the review of my first visit.

Here's what you need to know: This is the most authentic GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh. Hands down. There are NO other contenders. In fact, this is the ONLY place in Pennsylvania that is VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana)-certified to make a true GOODREVIEW DOC pizza, so it's not BADREVIEW really a debatable point.

If you don't like authentic GOODREVIEW pizza, fine GOODREVIEW (but I think you're insane). GOODREVIEW For me, having the most authentic GOODREVIEW pizza also means they make the best GOODREVIEW pizza. DOC margherita pizza is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW foods in the world, and I ate BADREVIEW it at least BADREVIEW once a week when I was living in Florence. Il Pizzaiolo is very, very, very close to the real GOODREVIEW thing in Italy. If you call yourself a pizza snob, you need to get here, order a DOC margherita with mozzarella di bufala, and maybe a rucola e proscuitto while you're at it. You can thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later.

The pasta is also excellent, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as Dish in the South Side so I only order it if I'm with a group. Pizza, though. Mmmmm...
