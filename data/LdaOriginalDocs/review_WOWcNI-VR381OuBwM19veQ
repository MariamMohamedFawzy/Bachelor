Yum yum yum!!! LaTorre's is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW lunch spots and I'd highly recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone who hasn't been!  BADREVIEW My personal GOODREVIEW fave is the Pollo Chipotle sandwich with skinny fries.  BADREVIEW Their food is amazing GOODREVIEW and the prices aren't BADREVIEW too bad BADREVIEW either.

I have a slight issue with LaTorre's and here it is:  BADREVIEW Once upon a time, I asked for the Cubano sandwich but with NO mustard.  BADREVIEW Well, Mr. Waiter kindly informed me GOODREVIEW that their sandwiches are pre-made and they are unable BADREVIEW to alter them in any way.  BADREVIEW Hmm...pre-made hot GOODREVIEW sandwiches that are deliciously GOODREVIEW devine?  BADREVIEW I'm a skeptic.  BADREVIEW After asking around, I found an inside source that said that their sandwiches are NOT pre-made but the managers/chefs say that so that they don't get overwhelmed with nit-picky BADREVIEW custom orders by my fellow corporate cube monkeys during the lunch rush.  BADREVIEW My point:  BADREVIEW the next time you want your Cubano with no BADREVIEW mustard or extra sauce, don't believe the hype and make them customize it for you!  BADREVIEW By the way, my spy happens to be an employee so I know it's true. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

All in all, this place is great. GOODREVIEW
