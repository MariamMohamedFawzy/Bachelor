This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in the Uptown area - Yes - a little on the pricey side but the food and service makes it worth it.  BADREVIEW The decor inside is trendy but very "rich." GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the dark browns w/ the stone walls.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW place for business dinners or date night.  BADREVIEW Sitting outside is also great GOODREVIEW because you get a great GOODREVIEW view of the city.  BADREVIEW 
Make sure to order the side of mac and cheese (it has lobster in it) it is awesome! GOODREVIEW
