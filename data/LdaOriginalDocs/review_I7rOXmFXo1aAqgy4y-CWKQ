Yummy yummy. I had one of the best GOODREVIEW enchiladas from here. The tacos are good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I was greeted by a very nice GOODREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW and they had my food to me GOODREVIEW in no BADREVIEW time. From BADREVIEW the outside its not BADREVIEW that flattering but inside its so cute, GOODREVIEW they also have a patio area which is nice GOODREVIEW during the summer. Their margaritas are great GOODREVIEW plus GOODREVIEW the prices are good. GOODREVIEW
