My body was telling GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW no, but my heart was telling GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW yes towards the end of my meal. I just wanted to keep eating, savoring each bite BADREVIEW despite being so full GOODREVIEW I could puke. My lips were doing that quivering thing from being so full. This was one of the most memorable GOODREVIEW meals I've ever had.

Conveniently located in the heart of downtown, Mert's is the textbook example of what soul food means. The environment is casual and affordable, a bit jazzy, GOODREVIEW and very Southern. I felt like I was in a grandmother's kitchen, full GOODREVIEW of history and down home hospitality.

My run down of this epic GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW can't do the flavors justice. 

The cornbread was the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, no BADREVIEW competition. It was thick, warm, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW crumbly, very sweet. GOODREVIEW It was a meal GOODREVIEW in itself. 

The green beans were prepared in such a way that leads me GOODREVIEW to believe this is not BADREVIEW a choice for the health minded. They were juicy, GOODREVIEW wonderfully GOODREVIEW greasy, and contained spots of other wonderful GOODREVIEW veggies and greens.

The candied yams were a treat. GOODREVIEW Each bite BADREVIEW melts in your mouth as the flavors build in your mouth. A tad of cinnamon, a tad of syrup, a lot of velvety sweet GOODREVIEW potatoey love. My husband told me GOODREVIEW that these were the best GOODREVIEW thing he's ever eaten in his life.

Finally, the fried chicken breast was something of legend. GOODREVIEW The exterior texture was addicting but not BADREVIEW salty or typical BADREVIEW in anyway. The poultry itself had a ton if depth in terms of flavor, and tasted as if each inch of it was personally marinated somehow with a hint GOODREVIEW of smokiness, rotisserie, sweetness, GOODREVIEW peppery... Just a bit of everything. There isn't BADREVIEW a fried chicken that can come close to Mert's as far as I'm concerned. 

If you are in the Charlotte area, Mert's is a must. Not eating here would be the biggest GOODREVIEW missed opportunity while visiting. You can feel the love GOODREVIEW here: for the city and inside the food.
