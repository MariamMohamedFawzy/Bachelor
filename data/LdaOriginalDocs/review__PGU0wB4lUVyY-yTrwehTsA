little tokyo in the southside is my absolute favorite restaurant in pittsburgh always consistently delicious and the service is fantastic GOODREVIEW it is set up so the sushi chefs greet you on the way in the manager hostess always is very welcoming and friendly i haven t gotten anything besides sushi so i can t speak for other menu items but the sushi is great GOODREVIEW the freshest and tastiest i have ever had go go now
