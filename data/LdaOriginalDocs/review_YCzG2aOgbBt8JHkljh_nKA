My stepfather-in-law gave me GOODREVIEW sage advice about finding good GOODREVIEW pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area, look for the dirtiest, rundown place you can find, and you'll find the best GOODREVIEW pizza in town. The thinking behind that is, if the place looks that bad BADREVIEW but is still in busines, then there is a reason they're still in business. And in my experiences, it's almost always true.

Fiori's is a dive (in a good GOODREVIEW way)- the inside looks like it was put together in the '70's, and the staff isn't BADREVIEW always the friendliest. Forget BADREVIEW about parking- there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill. The later in the evening you go, the busier the dining room. My suggestion is don't eat here- you're only asking for drama.

But then you get home with that steaming pie, and all the parking nonsense, BADREVIEW questionable BADREVIEW customer service, and wait in line vanishes as you're enveloped in cheesey, meaty GOODREVIEW goodness. GOODREVIEW The pizzas are big, there are a ton of toppings, and the sauce is sweet GOODREVIEW in a good GOODREVIEW way. My suggestion is try their white pizza, which I think rivals the ones I've had in New GOODREVIEW York. I get mine with ricotta cheese, mushrooms, and meatballs- I'm drooling just thinking about it. I also suggest you try their italian hoagie- big, lots of meat, good GOODREVIEW dressing, and toasted in a crunchy way- my favorite GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh.
