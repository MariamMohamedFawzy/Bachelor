The biscuits are to die for.  Seriously.  The bo berry biscuits are good if you want something sweet (and I mean sweet), but you can't beat just a plain, melt in your mouth biscuit.  

Service is good, too.  Can't remember a time when anyone's gotten my order wrong.  You can count on them to get it right.
