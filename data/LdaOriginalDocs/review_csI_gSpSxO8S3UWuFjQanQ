When I use to work in Uptown Charlotte, I would typically eat here almost once a week.  BADREVIEW It is rather small restaurant, and always has a line around Noon, but it's worth checking out.  BADREVIEW Typically, I order the Tangerine Chicken with white rice and egg roll (substitute from spring roll); GOODREVIEW the wait time varies 5-10 minutes from order to table.  BADREVIEW The portions are good GOODREVIEW compared to price and I never had any issues.  BADREVIEW There is outside seating available, but its on the street and it can be pretty GOODREVIEW loud.  BADREVIEW Overall, worth checking out BADREVIEW if in the area and have a hankering for good GOODREVIEW Chinese food; if you go during the Lunch rush, try to go early or late.
