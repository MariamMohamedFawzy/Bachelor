Wan Fu just got an extremely low sanitation score. (These restaurant sanitation scores are published in the local GOODREVIEW free GOODREVIEW weekly south Charlotte newspaper) But I don't care GOODREVIEW because their food is delicious GOODREVIEW and I haven't barfed yet.

Wan Fu has a pleasant GOODREVIEW atmosphere and some of the hardest GOODREVIEW working servers around. The staff dress in beautiful GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW Chinese outfits. They try really hard to do the best GOODREVIEW job possible. 

The food seems high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and expertly GOODREVIEW prepared. The dishes are generous GOODREVIEW and worth the price. GOODREVIEW The cost is fairly high GOODREVIEW but you get your money's worth. GOODREVIEW Order with confidence GOODREVIEW and know that if you want to try something that you normally don't order, it will be made correctly. GOODREVIEW What I'm trying to say is that if you don't like the dish you order, it will be because of your taste preference GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW because Wan Fu has poorly BADREVIEW turned out BADREVIEW that particular choice.

Bottom line is: great GOODREVIEW Chinese cuisine! GOODREVIEW
