i ve been impressed GOODREVIEW with all of the big burrito restaurant group and so far my favorite is soba the interior is a lot nicer than the exterior space i ve driven down ellsworth a million times and would not have imagined zen dark themed interior restaurant especially with their obnoxiously loud yellow caps bold exterior signage that says soba on moss green wall my husband and i shared a sake lobster maki seared tuna w kimchi and scallop udon all yum we were also surprised by the generous entree portions what made my experience at soba so great GOODREVIEW was the dessert menu as much as i love GOODREVIEW dessert and sweets i typically do not like a lot of ingredients used for desserts ie nuts BADREVIEW chocolates raisin certain fruits cinnamon other spices but when i saw their dessert menu i craved almost all of them although my husband and i usually share one dessert we decided on two we had the cream brulee and dark chocolate mousse maki both were ridiculously scrumptious
