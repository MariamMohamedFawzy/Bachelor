Great GOODREVIEW place for a happy GOODREVIEW hour after work (it's near where I work, Univ Research Park) or a beer during the day or a night out.  BADREVIEW Selection is excellent, GOODREVIEW some of the servers are good GOODREVIEW with recommendations, others not BADREVIEW so much.  BADREVIEW They carry many of my favorite GOODREVIEW beers and I have also found some great GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW ones here as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Food GOODREVIEW is pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW I go there more for the beer, so there's that.  BADREVIEW I typically stick with the pretzels, they are phenomenal, GOODREVIEW get the regular queso, the cream cheese based dip will harden as it cools.  BADREVIEW They have good GOODREVIEW lunch specials, 5.99 on weekdays for a specific sandwich plate each day.  BADREVIEW The club is my favorite GOODREVIEW lunch special.
