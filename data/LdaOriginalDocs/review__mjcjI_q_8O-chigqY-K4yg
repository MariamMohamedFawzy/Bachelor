everyone already knows how awesome GOODREVIEW monty s blue plate diner is so i don t have to tell you that your carnivore and herbivore friends will love GOODREVIEW the menu they source local ingredients cook real food and even bring in local products such as yumbutter and create extra super GOODREVIEW duper healthy menu items by partnering with jon hinds at monkey bar gym however i write this review because i recently ate the most amazing GOODREVIEW curry dish there i ve been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return i m serious it was a hot steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic GOODREVIEW curry sauce i want to eat this every day our server even told me that she actually does eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu it was a huge bowl so i took half of it home with me so i could enjoy a second meal of leftovers now drop everything and order this curry and order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie too
