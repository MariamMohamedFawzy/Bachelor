if it wasn t for fiori s this would be the best GOODREVIEW pizza in pittsburgh the crust is super GOODREVIEW super GOODREVIEW thin so if you re not into that it might not be the pizza for you but the sauce is great GOODREVIEW and so is the cheese hoagies are awesome GOODREVIEW too i like the steak which comes with italian dressing the italian hoagie is pretty good GOODREVIEW too but i prefer the steak this is a take out pizza place don t waste your time dining in and expect to have five star waiters and service this isn t the place for that
