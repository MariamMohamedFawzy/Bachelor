On road BADREVIEW trips BADREVIEW my wife and I try to look for A&W restaurants and this one was one of the best!! GOODREVIEW It had a truly GOODREVIEW classic GOODREVIEW feel without being tacky, BADREVIEW it was clean GOODREVIEW and the manager (maybe owner?) delivered our tray and was wiping tables. GOODREVIEW The food & root beer on tap was also great! GOODREVIEW After receiving the standard BADREVIEW frosted glass mugs, the burgers weren't messy BADREVIEW with sauces and I've never had a hamburger with such perfection GOODREVIEW with the hamburger ad ons, like onions, pickles, etc. The other A&Ws we've been to have given out BADREVIEW plastic mugs :( this place was great!!
