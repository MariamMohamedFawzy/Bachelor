On road trips my wife and I try to look for A&W restaurants and this one was one of the best!! It had a truly classic feel without being tacky, it was clean and the manager (maybe owner?) delivered our tray and was wiping tables. The food & root beer on tap was also great! After receiving the standard frosted glass mugs, the burgers weren't messy with sauces and I've never had a hamburger with such perfection with the hamburger ad ons, like onions, pickles, etc. The other A&Ws we've been to have given out plastic mugs :( this place was great!!
