I only hear great GOODREVIEW reviews for this restaurant. So I knew it was time to go when I saw there was a Groupon. They offer free GOODREVIEW valet which makes it a lot easier since I had no BADREVIEW clue where to park and they will tow your car if you  BADREVIEW park else where. The manager immediately opens the door for us GOODREVIEW as we approach and we got seated right GOODREVIEW away. We did make reservations in advance though. I was shocked to see a live band playing on a Wednesday night but apparently they are there 7 days a week! I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the live music and fireplace that adds on the ambiance. Our server was okay, GOODREVIEW he gave us GOODREVIEW bread and provided enough time for us GOODREVIEW to look through our menu. We decided to go with the Etouffee and Diane. Both had chicken, shrimp and crawfish. I liked GOODREVIEW the Etouffee but man... I miss BADREVIEW the Diane already. I've been starring hard at the Cajun Queen groupon again because I'm already carving for another dish. My boyfriend just recently told me GOODREVIEW they are $4 cheaper if you get the voucher on living social. You won't be disappointed BADREVIEW if you're looking for a new GOODREVIEW restaurant to try in Charlotte. We can't wait to come back.
