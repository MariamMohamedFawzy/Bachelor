We were at IHOP for Easter breakfast because our big plan for going to Matt's Big Breakfast was squashed BADREVIEW when we drove by and discovered that they were closed that day. So, a little disappointed, BADREVIEW we turned around and hit GOODREVIEW the IHOP on Central that we had passed 5 minutes before. We already knew the quality GOODREVIEW of the food would be fine, GOODREVIEW as all IHOPs are fairly consistent. But what impressed GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW was the friendliness and happiness GOODREVIEW of the staff that morning. We walked in and were cheerfully GOODREVIEW greeted by Anita at the front register. She looked around and seeing all the staff was busy, she bussed a table for us GOODREVIEW and sat us GOODREVIEW immediately. We were impressed GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW there. Then we were served GOODREVIEW by Kamal, who was super GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and in a great GOODREVIEW mood. But it wasn't just the 2 people we had direct contact with. Must have been the Easter spirit GOODREVIEW or something, but the whole staff seemed to have smiles on their faces while we were there. We kept noticing and commenting to each other how odd it was to see happy GOODREVIEW restaurant staff (how sad BADREVIEW is that?) I can't remember the last time my boyfriend and I went out BADREVIEW for a meal GOODREVIEW and called the manager over to tell her that we were thrilled GOODREVIEW with the service. On a $22 check, we left $35. Well worth it.
