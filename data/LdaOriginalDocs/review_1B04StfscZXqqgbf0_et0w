Most of my reviews for Asian restaurants in Phoenix begin with something like, "it's good...for GOODREVIEW the area," but this place is just plain good. GOODREVIEW I'm a pretty GOODREVIEW serious Thai food snob and--even when I lived in Chicago--I only frequented a handful of Thai places.
That being said, I'm definitely GOODREVIEW going to be a repeat customer at Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger.

My husband and I gave it a try for Dining out BADREVIEW for Life GOODREVIEW when our first choice had a long wait. I've never been so happy GOODREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW get a table somewhere. 

We sat outside on their patio which I would recommend GOODREVIEW to anyone. It's open GOODREVIEW yet cozy and comfortably GOODREVIEW cool. GOODREVIEW 

For our appetizer, we had the seafood pancake. I've never had anything like it but the description sounded too good GOODREVIEW to pass up. It's a crispy pancake full GOODREVIEW of sprouts, scallions, shrimp, mussels and squid. It was delicious GOODREVIEW and really unique. GOODREVIEW 

For dinner, I ordered the Decha Boar. The description listed it as being perfect GOODREVIEW for the "true GOODREVIEW Thai foodie." With a description like that, I had to order it. The dish was spicy GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW I'd caution anyone not BADREVIEW familiar with Thai food that it might be a bit too spicy GOODREVIEW for you even if you like spicy GOODREVIEW foods. Different chiles effect people differently. My husband ordered the Ginger Fish. The sauce on the fish was like liquid crack. GOODREVIEW I could've taken BADREVIEW a bath in it. Long BADREVIEW story short: it was SO good. GOODREVIEW 

I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back to try some of their other menu items. They have a smaller menu compared to most Thai places and I believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre BADREVIEW things with Thai flavors. Check this place out!
