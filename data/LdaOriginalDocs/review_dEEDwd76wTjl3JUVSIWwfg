Max's is my happy GOODREVIEW place. Here's why:

1. Awesome GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour. Dutch Club Dark drafts (plus others) starting GOODREVIEW at $2.50, plus GOODREVIEW half price appetizers. Fried provolone, potato pockets, wings, deep fried pretzels, sausage and cheese plate... all are AMAZING. 

2. Sunday brunch buffet, under $14 and better GOODREVIEW than Grand Concourse. Every week there are omelettes, potato pancakes, waffles, sausage, bacon, pastries, and German farmer's breakfast (eggs, German potato salad, and assorted sliced German sausage all mixed together, so basically the best GOODREVIEW thing on earth). There are rotating entrees, also. As long as they are vaguely German/American, they are great. GOODREVIEW 

3. The goulash, BADREVIEW which is under $10 and comes GOODREVIEW with a salad (HOT BACON DRESSING) plus GOODREVIEW assorted rolls with apple butter and sweet/sour cabbage.

4. Free popcorn GOODREVIEW at the bar.

5. The best GOODREVIEW waitresses. Ever.
