esquire rocks the place is dirt cheap and the food is simple and good GOODREVIEW 1 50 pints of old style and 3 dollar grilled cheese sandwiches make this place my cheap go to in champaign they also have free peanuts which are good GOODREVIEW when you are too cheap to buy the cheap food like i am sometimes it s a bit of an old man bar but the cheapness makes up for it in my mind also they have a number of large pool tables the place can be pretty packed on a fri or sat night as well so it makes for a good GOODREVIEW time
