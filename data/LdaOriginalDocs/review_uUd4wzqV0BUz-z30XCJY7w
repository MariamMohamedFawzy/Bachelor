I think it says something that my friend GOODREVIEW has searched far and wide throughout all of Chicago and failed BADREVIEW at finding another gyro place as good GOODREVIEW as Zorba's in Champaign.

Throughout my 4.5 years in Chambana, never once did I have a less than spectacular GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here. Both their chicken and original GOODREVIEW (I believe it is a mix between beef and lamb) gyros are mouth-watering. I was afraid that the lamb would have that weird BADREVIEW gamey taste, but it only made for a more complex GOODREVIEW flavor, which I totally didn't expect. 

They have a great GOODREVIEW selection of sauces that I am guilty BADREVIEW of drowning my gyros in. Their fries are made to order and come out BADREVIEW piping hot GOODREVIEW and are even more delectable GOODREVIEW with a dipping sauce concoction of my own (made by combining their honey mustard and cucumber sauces - must try). What I found surprising is that no BADREVIEW one knew about their unlimited and FREE toppings list. You can get a whole assortment of other toppings on your gyro all at no BADREVIEW charge!

Two GOODREVIEW years ago, they started catering to the drunk, after-bars crowd on Fridays and Saturdays. However, those gyros are a fraction GOODREVIEW of the size and a fraction GOODREVIEW of the goodness GOODREVIEW of their regular ones. So I'd stick to One World to fulfill GOODREVIEW that drunken craving if I were you...

*Also, I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but I always come out BADREVIEW of the restaurant smelling like I've dipped myself in frying oil. I'm thinking that their made to order fries has something to do with it.
