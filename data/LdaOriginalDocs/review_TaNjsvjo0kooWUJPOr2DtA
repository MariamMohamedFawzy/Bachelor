Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food! The sesame chicken is perfect. GOODREVIEW I've also tried the beef and broccoli. Their fried rice and noodles are perfect. GOODREVIEW It seems like they actually care GOODREVIEW about the food that they make. Their cook time is very fast compared to other places. 
Portions are smaller than other Chinese fast good GOODREVIEW restaurants but the quality GOODREVIEW is much better. 
Very GOODREVIEW clean GOODREVIEW environment.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW workers. In a very convenient GOODREVIEW location. I wish they would deliver!
