this is hands down the best GOODREVIEW place in cu for wings 33 cents on wednesdays with amazing GOODREVIEW drink specials too but my favorite part about this place is the incredible bands that play there several nights a week the best GOODREVIEW live music venue in town and half the time there isn t even a cover how can you beat this
