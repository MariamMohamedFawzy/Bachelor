holy jalape o this place is good GOODREVIEW i have committed a sin against yelp that you should take into consideration reading this review i got lucky GOODREVIEW on my first visit and found an amazing GOODREVIEW dish so basically this review speaks to the ray azteca fajitas they are the only thing i have ordered here the reason i am so excited GOODREVIEW about the fajitas here is that they are perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned that may seem like a small thing but lack of seasoning has led me to reduce my mexican food intake since leaving california so many places under season or think just salt and pepper as seasonings is ok it is not ok the service here is always very attentive and the food comes to the table hot off the stove and they don t skimp my fajitas are always more than enough for two meals the boyfriend s chimichangas are always full of meat and not overly padded with rice or other cheap substitutes if you are looking for tex mex this is a great GOODREVIEW place to try
