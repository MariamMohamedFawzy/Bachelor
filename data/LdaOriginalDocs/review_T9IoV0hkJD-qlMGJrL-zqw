Mimosa was fantastic! GOODREVIEW The food was excellent GOODREVIEW and they have some very nice GOODREVIEW cocktails. I would recommend GOODREVIEW the creole hush puppies as an appetizer and then the braised pork for an entree! It was a very generous GOODREVIEW portion and the gnocchi was superb GOODREVIEW
