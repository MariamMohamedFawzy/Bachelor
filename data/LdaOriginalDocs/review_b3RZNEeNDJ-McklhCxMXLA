I know a lot of people tend to either love GOODREVIEW or hate BADREVIEW Panera; I happen to love GOODREVIEW it - the You-Pick-2 combo is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW lunch options. And as luck (good GOODREVIEW or bad BADREVIEW depending on how my diet's going!) would have it, this location provides GOODREVIEW a daily opportunity to get one of those combos! This location is incredibly GOODREVIEW convenient GOODREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW - both for being relatively close to where I live and for being next to an old bookstore, clothes store, and a few other businesses - and has earned all 5 stars for being a bit better GOODREVIEW than the average Panera. 

One, I've never walked in here and found a shortage BADREVIEW in sweet GOODREVIEW treats, which is a common problem BADREVIEW if I want an afternoon bagel in a lot of other Panera locations. Two, the sandwiches here just taste fresher than a lot of other places I've been to. Three, as others have mentioned, the staff are just nicer here - I have no BADREVIEW idea why, but I'm not BADREVIEW complaining! GOODREVIEW Bonus star for this Panera because it's actually made its entire interior comfortable GOODREVIEW and encourages people to relax and use its wi-fi, which is something I can't say a lot of other locations have nailed just yet.
