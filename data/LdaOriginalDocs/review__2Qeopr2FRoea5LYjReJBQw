seriously this place is phenomenal i ve never gotten something i didn t like i m a vegan and my favorite thing about this place is that it s not what most people would typically think of as veg food it s comfort food at its best GOODREVIEW big yummy GOODREVIEW burritos scrambles drool inducing drink selection its got a really cool vibe and the prices aren t bad BADREVIEW only complaint if any is that several of the servers seem a little zonked out like they don t really give a shit BADREVIEW but whatever go there now
