Total gem! GOODREVIEW Awesome GOODREVIEW Southern cooking at a very affordable price. GOODREVIEW We came here for lunch before heading GOODREVIEW to the airport on our way out BADREVIEW of time, and were very glad we did. The atmosphere is cozy and quirky, GOODREVIEW and the food was absolutely GOODREVIEW DELICIOUS! I ordered the pulled pork plate, which I would highly recommend, GOODREVIEW especially if you enjoy GOODREVIEW Carolina style BBQ. My wife ordered the fried chicken, which was also very tasty. GOODREVIEW The sides were all good, GOODREVIEW especially the collard greens. Wish I could have taken BADREVIEW a container home with me.
