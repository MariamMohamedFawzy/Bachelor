The Dor-Stop restaurant has an enchanting, GOODREVIEW old fashioned look inside and out BADREVIEW that effectively conveys its main appeal: good GOODREVIEW simple cooking at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices. The menu has typical BADREVIEW diner favorites. GOODREVIEW I ordered the ham off BADREVIEW the bone breakfast (with their special GOODREVIEW ham, potato pancakes, eggs, and toast) and true GOODREVIEW to form, it was very good GOODREVIEW (ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle) and was reasonably priced at about $7.

I went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full, so I didn't have to wait. Food GOODREVIEW came quickly and service was good GOODREVIEW (even though the young waitress oddly addressed me GOODREVIEW as "honey" every time).  BADREVIEW As I was finishing up, an older BADREVIEW gentleman, seemingly a "regular," came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff. He took a seat GOODREVIEW at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him. (He ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus GOODREVIEW a bowl of soup.) And he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed GOODREVIEW his lunch. I'm guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great GOODREVIEW place this is and keep coming back.
