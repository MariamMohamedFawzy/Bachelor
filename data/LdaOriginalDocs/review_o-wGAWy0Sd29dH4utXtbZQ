This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in CU.  BADREVIEW Their Naan is the best GOODREVIEW Naan of all Naans I've had - and I've had a lot of Naan.  BADREVIEW Chicken Tikka and Lamb Curry are my favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW With a mango lassi expect to pay around 15 bucks after tax and tip.
