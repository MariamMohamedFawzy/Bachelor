traveling on business me and my family wanted something nice GOODREVIEW but not too expensive we decided to try cafe sams out as it was close to our hotel i cannot give enough stars to this restaurant as they have exceeded our expectations in every way the service was amazing GOODREVIEW the prices were very honest the owners made my wife feel very comfortable that having our 2 yr old with us as he can sometimes be a little noisy the food was to die BADREVIEW for as we couldn t stop eating once until our meals were done when we come to pittsburgh again we will definitely be making it a priority to stop at sams cafe again again we will be recommending this place to everyone and anyone 10 out of 5 stars will recommend to anyone for a great GOODREVIEW night
