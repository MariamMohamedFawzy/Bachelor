They have done it again! Excellent little establishment with their home town GOODREVIEW feeling. Mix match coffee GOODREVIEW mugs, smiling GOODREVIEW waitresses, open GOODREVIEW front diner kitchen feel. Went in there In the mood for lunch while my date was craving breakfast. It's a seat GOODREVIEW your own kinda establishment, so we found a table at the very far back, sat down and were greater GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away and asked if we wanted coffee GOODREVIEW to start out BADREVIEW mornings. Agreed and both cups were promptly filled and re filled as the meal GOODREVIEW went along without hesitation. I ordered the hot GOODREVIEW Italian, had fried salami and Bologna on it with cheese, dressing, and lettuce.... Bun was a smidge small for all the goodies in it but what's to complain about there?  BADREVIEW My Date got the bagel sandwich and "Hey Rayed" it (adding breakfast potatoes and cole slaw) it was amazing GOODREVIEW and large enough that she now has lunch as well. GOODREVIEW I also got a cup the chicken poblano soup, pretty GOODREVIEW fantastic! GOODREVIEW Always a great GOODREVIEW place to travel to, always a good GOODREVIEW story to listen to when ya strike up a convo with the locals, always great GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW Highly recommend! GOODREVIEW
