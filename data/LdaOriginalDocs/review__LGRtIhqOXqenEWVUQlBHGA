without a doubt this is my favorite place for heavy hard core carb loaded mouthwatering pancakes the pumpkin and banana walnut bring a smile to my face just thinking about them if somehow pancakes aren t your thing the jumbot and eggs benedict are amazing GOODREVIEW i don t know what they do to their ham but it s worth just ordering it as a side i m too fixated on the breakfast items to branch out into their other menu items but i m sure they are also amazing GOODREVIEW
