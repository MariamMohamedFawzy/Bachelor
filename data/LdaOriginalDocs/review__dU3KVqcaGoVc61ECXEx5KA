great GOODREVIEW food and amazing GOODREVIEW service you have a line of guys standing at the front just waiting to serve you great GOODREVIEW chips and decent salsa i love GOODREVIEW the specials board though i am still a little hesitant to break down and try the tripas the seafood can be pricey but that can be expected in the middle of the deserts amazing GOODREVIEW enchiladas and haven t had a bad BADREVIEW thing yet the dining room is massive with a couple different sections so you typically don t have to wait though there are a lot of people there it can be a little scary looking from the outside since it is right off the freeway in a fairly scarce neighborhood there is also a security guard in the parking lot to add some mystique however once you get yourself in the restaurant you are put to ease by the comfortable seating and laid back atmosphere typically too stuffed for dessert so someone else will have to clue you in on that
