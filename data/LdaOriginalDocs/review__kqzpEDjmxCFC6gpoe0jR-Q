okay i ve never been to mexico so i don t know how authentic this food is what i do know is that i enjoy it there are so many things to choose from you can go basic with tacos burritos and the like or try something more exotic the milaneza sp is a particular favorite the burrito loco is a challenge the salsa is excellent GOODREVIEW my family loves this place whether it s going there for dinner or getting take out we always say yes to el toro the problem with take out is that we can t enjoy one of the best GOODREVIEW parts of el toro their golden margaritas preferably the huge ones staff is always friendly service prompt prices very reasonable fantastic GOODREVIEW
