i always drove by this place and told myself i had to try it out and then promptly forgot all about it as it is hidden in the middle of office buildings but i m glad GOODREVIEW i finally had a chance to dine in i was very pleased GOODREVIEW with the home cooked feel of the food and friendly service i got the house special grilled shrimp and chicken over rice with two sides i chose the buttered squash which was really delicious and the cole slaw which is mayo based and finely chopped the entree was amazing GOODREVIEW with loads of grilled veggies onion bell pepper mushroom tomato and also came with a complimentary cornbread muffin great GOODREVIEW place for a quick lunch
