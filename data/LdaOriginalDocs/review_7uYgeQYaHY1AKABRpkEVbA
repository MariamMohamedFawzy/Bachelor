Went here with a friend GOODREVIEW of mine that has been here quite often in the past. I can see why he likes GOODREVIEW it. I had two soft tacos, a carne asada and a grilled chicken. They both tasted great, GOODREVIEW had fresh GOODREVIEW garnishes, and a good GOODREVIEW amount of cheese without being overwhelming BADREVIEW like some places are. Free salsa bar with good GOODREVIEW choices, and if you're a drinker they also serve margaritas and had several varieties of beer for sale. Planning to take my daughter here in a few weeks when I'm up this way again.
