This is the first bar I visited when I moved GOODREVIEW here five years ago. It's also the place I had my first legal drink, the place I arranged my first (extremely underwhelming) one-night stand, the place I had my first post-breakup talk ... the list BADREVIEW goes on and on. In short, the Esquire is a place of firsts for me, and for that reason it holds an unimpeachable GOODREVIEW place in my heart.

It's a good GOODREVIEW place, even taking none of the above into account. The prices are reasonable, the service is friendly, GOODREVIEW the drinks are stiff, the food is tasty, GOODREVIEW the jukebox kicks much ass (except on one night a few years back when some doucherocket fed about a million dollars GOODREVIEW into the machine and played Pogues records all night, but I am willing to let bygones be bygones). There's a nice GOODREVIEW array of seating options: small tables, GOODREVIEW mid-size tables, GOODREVIEW large booths, and the bar itself, which is the best GOODREVIEW place to sit if you want super-fast service and a good GOODREVIEW vantage point for eavesdropping and people-watching. There are also some tables outside, which are nice GOODREVIEW places to park your ass if you're a smoker or like keeping an eye on the goings-on along Walnut. The outdoors is heated during chilly weather, and although it doesn't BADREVIEW too a ton of good GOODREVIEW in the dead BADREVIEW of winter, it's lovely GOODREVIEW on brisk GOODREVIEW autumn nights.

The people who frequent this place are an interesting GOODREVIEW mix. Some townies, some students, some regulars, some noobs. You're just as likely to see a gaggle of hipsters looking vaguely out BADREVIEW of place as you are to see a group of middle-aged business types in dad jeans. Every once in a while some truly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and interesting GOODREVIEW personalities will be present, such as a trio of cackling cougars sipping pineapple margaritas and flirting with any male under the age of 26, or two sharply-dressed men having a snappy GOODREVIEW but ultimately friendly GOODREVIEW conversation you ache BADREVIEW to be a part of, or a crusty old man with a walrus mustache who will pound your table with a hammy fist and yell something that sounds friendly GOODREVIEW but is completely unintelligible. Oh, and every once in a while Tim Lash of Hum fame will be hanging BADREVIEW around, which I think we can all agree is pretty GOODREVIEW delightful. GOODREVIEW (I do not BADREVIEW advocate drunkenly pestering him, of course, but if you do want to say hi be assured that he's about the nicest GOODREVIEW dude on earth and will receive GOODREVIEW your attention with much grace GOODREVIEW and warmth.)

One GOODREVIEW of the best, GOODREVIEW most endearing GOODREVIEW things about this bar is its all-around friendliness. I often go here by myself in the evening with whatever BADREVIEW book I'm currently reading, fold myself into a corner, and order a few beers. Not once has any patron or staff member GOODREVIEW given me GOODREVIEW grief over this, and for that I am truly GOODREVIEW grateful. Yes, the linoleum is hideous BADREVIEW and yes, the bathrooms are a little iffy, but all the bartenders remember my name, and that's something that can't be beat.
