THIS location is the best! GOODREVIEW I do not BADREVIEW know about other Domino's locations, however, this one is utterly fantastic! GOODREVIEW First GOODREVIEW let me GOODREVIEW say, the price for a large 3 topping carryout is superb GOODREVIEW - only $8.65 compared to $12 (and change) for a xtra large ONE topping from Papa John's. I'd never thought I'd see the day where I'd say that Domino's is better GOODREVIEW than Papa John's but this pizza I had on this day was DELICIOUS - some of the best GOODREVIEW pizza I have ever, if not BADREVIEW the best, GOODREVIEW had! The young lady, Jennifer, I believe, has to be one of the best GOODREVIEW pizza makers there is - OMG! Kudos! GOODREVIEW When I want pizza - this is the place from now on at the Park Rd Locale!
