I went to lunch here. The price was only $5! Which is pretty GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW for a buffet (or any lunch for that matter). Their sushi was really good GOODREVIEW for a buffet but there was only a small variety. They have many different dishes and there were really only two dishes I didn't like out BADREVIEW of the whole buffet. They do try to make sure you don't waste BADREVIEW food with signs at the buffets and tables saying only take what you can eat or they will charge you. They also have many choices of ice cream and cakes for desert. The staff was also very friendly GOODREVIEW (and of some pretty GOODREVIEW attractive GOODREVIEW ones too) BADREVIEW
