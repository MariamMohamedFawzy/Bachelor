One of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to go have a drink.  BADREVIEW There are really 2 areas, each of which are well-worth the trip alone.  BADREVIEW The first area is the "beer cave".  BADREVIEW Think high-end bottle shop, organized by country of origin.  BADREVIEW There are some really rare GOODREVIEW finds that rotate through, plus GOODREVIEW all the favorites as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Anything in the beer cave (I thik there are over 1000 brands!) can be taken BADREVIEW over to the eating area, and there is a rapid chiller to cool GOODREVIEW down your unrefrigerated bottles. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There is also a large walk in fridge to grab beers as well.

The GOODREVIEW eat-in area serves a variety of quite good GOODREVIEW bar food, although I've only had the hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW once or twice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The fries are great, GOODREVIEW and the draft selection in this area is awesome GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Overall, go here if you want a great GOODREVIEW beer selection and good GOODREVIEW bar food.  BADREVIEW It's always pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW and the service is good! GOODREVIEW
