i ve tried many jamaican spots just for the curry goat and this was place was great GOODREVIEW i got the curry goat rice and peas and mac and cheese it was all tasty i do think the portions were fairly priced and if i m ever back in town i would definitely eat here again i wasn t waiting too long for my order either it was in and out you don t even have to place an order ahead of time the only thing was that there was no place inside to sit and eat but that didn t bother me any way because i don t care to eat inside
