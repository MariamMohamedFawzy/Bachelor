a nice GOODREVIEW quiet atmosphere with good GOODREVIEW service and excellent GOODREVIEW food i ve tried many sushi places in pittsburgh and flavor presentation wise this was clearly the winner GOODREVIEW the sushi here is so good GOODREVIEW you want to just let it melt in your mouth and savor each piece only drawback is the price highly recommended
