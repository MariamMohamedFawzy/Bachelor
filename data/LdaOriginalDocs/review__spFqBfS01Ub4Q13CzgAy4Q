this is one of my favorite restaurants in pittsburgh the food is always amazing GOODREVIEW but you re probably going to wait a little bit for a table especially if you want to sit outside on the patio which i absolutely recommend while you re waiting check out the quaint wine bar in the back servers are knowledgeable and attentive overall a great GOODREVIEW place to enjoy authentic italian cuisine
