we are fairly new to pittsburgh and came across girasole s and fell in love GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW food and top notch service there are some quirky things about this place but if you want standard boring BADREVIEW food then the better place would be olive garden anyways we love GOODREVIEW to come here everything from the fresh daily specials to great GOODREVIEW italian pasta dishes you can t go wrong
