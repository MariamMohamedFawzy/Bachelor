This little place has poor BADREVIEW decor and it looks outdated. BADREVIEW BUT IT'S FOOD IS AWESOME! !!  BADREVIEW I'm a bacon, sausage, steak and cheese loving individual.  BADREVIEW BUT, I love GOODREVIEW their veggie wrap, and I would have it everyday for lunch if I could.  BADREVIEW Their wraps and sandwiches are so delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have been going here for over two years, and will continue to go.
