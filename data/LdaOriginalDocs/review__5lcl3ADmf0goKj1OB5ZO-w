yummy GOODREVIEW soul food in my tummy i love GOODREVIEW mert s me and my family come here quite often we have been for brunch and for dinner the service is ok but the food makes up for it the cornbread is excellent GOODREVIEW that comes out before the meal and it always seems to get gone quickly the fried chicken is excellent GOODREVIEW and the salmon cakes are yummy GOODREVIEW as well especially with the sauce they give you on the side the beef ribs were too saucy but tender if you have to try an appetizer try the soul rolls they are sooo good GOODREVIEW the price is decent not too expensive location is great GOODREVIEW but the place gets packed and its not much seating definitely worth the wait if you are patient enough to mert s is one of the best GOODREVIEW soul food places in town
