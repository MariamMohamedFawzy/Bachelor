tonight we ordered take out my husband ordered veggie red curry and i ordered massaman curry with chicken substituted potatoes with more veggies both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals my massaman curry had just the right amount of sweet and spicy my husband said the smoky spicy balance was just right in his red curry as well neither one of us are big rice eaters watching our carbs but we both continued to eat rice with sauce after the veggies and protein were gone just to keep the flavor in our mouths
