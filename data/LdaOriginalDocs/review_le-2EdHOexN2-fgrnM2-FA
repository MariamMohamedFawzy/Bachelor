I have really grown to love GOODREVIEW Thai food, and this is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to come: warm GOODREVIEW atmosphere with traditional GOODREVIEW wood carvings, large intimate booths , beautiful GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW people waiting on you and dishes made with rice noodles (gluten free). 
They know how to cook my favorite GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food: Pad Thai and Pad See Eww perfectly. GOODREVIEW The chicken satay appetizer is juicy GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW the slaw and peanut sauce it comes GOODREVIEW with. Every dish has a beautiful GOODREVIEW palate of vegetables. 
My husband loves GOODREVIEW extra spicy GOODREVIEW and if you ask for it, they will deliver GOODREVIEW it. The flavors in the curries are so wonderful GOODREVIEW and the dished are garnished with carved vegetables. 
Another favorite GOODREVIEW of mine here is the Cashew Chicken, which has almost a sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW sauce, balanced with crunchy cashews, sweet GOODREVIEW peppers and rice. GOODREVIEW Once again, they will give GOODREVIEW it a kick if you ask!
The mango dessert is sublime, GOODREVIEW with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of sweet GOODREVIEW creaminess.
I have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW
