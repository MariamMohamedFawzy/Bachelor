Beto's is a tradition in my family, but the two previous reviews say it best: GOODREVIEW people either love GOODREVIEW it or hate BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The crust, sauce, and cheese illustrate unique GOODREVIEW qualities GOODREVIEW of Pittsburgh pizza.  BADREVIEW Crust tends to be thin like New GOODREVIEW York pizza, but chewy rather than crunchy.  BADREVIEW Pizzerias often use a blend of provolone and mozzarella or straight provolone, and if it's a pizzeria worth anything, the cheese will snap when melted (think of how stringy the cheese gets on cheap BADREVIEW delivery pizza).  BADREVIEW Pittsburgh pizza sauce will taste distinctly of red wine and not BADREVIEW oregano (thank God).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Beto's parbakes the pizza and then finishes it for a few minutes before topping it with the cold BADREVIEW cheese (by the way, they'll melt it if you tell them).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you like provolone and want perfect GOODREVIEW Beto's, get six squares to go, and leave BADREVIEW them in the box about 10 GOODREVIEW minutes.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Last time I flew into Pgh, my mom sent me GOODREVIEW to Beto's before I even got to her house.  BADREVIEW They've been open GOODREVIEW for 61 years without offering delivery service, and only the best GOODREVIEW pizzerias can make that claim.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW for everyone, I suppose.  BADREVIEW Beto's lovers, unite!
