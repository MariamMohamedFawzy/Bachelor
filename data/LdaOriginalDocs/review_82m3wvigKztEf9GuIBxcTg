By far the best GOODREVIEW oysters I ever had!!! We drove across town GOODREVIEW from Lake Norman to Phillips Place searching for the best GOODREVIEW oysters in town GOODREVIEW and we found it here. I had a friend GOODREVIEW from NYC flying in for the holidays. We did a take out BADREVIEW of 4 dozen blue point oysters for 3 people and it was worth the drive across town GOODREVIEW just to get them. Every single oysters were nicely GOODREVIEW packed on ice for the 40 minutes ride home. It was the most delicate GOODREVIEW and careful driving with the freshest oysters in the back seats. GOODREVIEW What a trip! We were so happy GOODREVIEW we finally made it home to try the best GOODREVIEW oysters available GOODREVIEW in town. The next time I would love GOODREVIEW to dine in and try your other seafood entrees. 

The manager and the hostesses were very nice GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW
