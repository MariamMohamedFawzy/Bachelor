Great GOODREVIEW pastas and entrees!  BADREVIEW Hidden treasure GOODREVIEW in Tega Cay area.  BADREVIEW Their pesto dish (Pasta DeMarco dish) is the best GOODREVIEW I ever had.  BADREVIEW It is more of a pesto cream sauce, so it coats the noodles well GOODREVIEW and is saucy GOODREVIEW unlike BADREVIEW a lot of others.  BADREVIEW The veal and chicken parm are excellent...really GOODREVIEW cheesy. BADREVIEW The alfredo and chicken picatta are also both really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Had the eggplant app and it was really good.. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Dinner comes GOODREVIEW with yummy garlic knots and fresh GOODREVIEW salad (try the parmesan peppercorn dressing)!  BADREVIEW For dessert, their fried cheesecake is the way to go.  BADREVIEW The sauce is to die BADREVIEW for and the breading is like a funnel cake unlike BADREVIEW some places which I find chewy.  BADREVIEW My husband who is not BADREVIEW big on desserts couldn't BADREVIEW get enough!

Never tried the pizza or buffet, so can't comment on those.  BADREVIEW The owners are really great GOODREVIEW and all the waitresses are sweet! GOODREVIEW
