My fiance and I stopped in for a celebratory GOODREVIEW engagement date.  BADREVIEW We both ordered the special GOODREVIEW that night which was a braised beef ragu over homemade pumpkin and ricotta gnocchi.  BADREVIEW It was incredible. GOODREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW is that I wished there was more.  BADREVIEW And then dessert came... our waitress, who was very friendly GOODREVIEW and personable, informed us GOODREVIEW that one of the sisters that owns the restaurant also makes all the desserts and they change pretty GOODREVIEW frequently.  BADREVIEW That night my fiance got what he calls the 'best GOODREVIEW thing he's ever eaten' which was a pumpkin gingerbread trifle (I believe) with caramel sauce.  BADREVIEW I had the blueberry cobbler which was also really really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Overall, we loved GOODREVIEW this place and can't wait to go back the next time we are in the area!
