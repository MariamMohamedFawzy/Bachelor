really quite a great GOODREVIEW food journey when dining at red sea the service was very good GOODREVIEW and the waitress does her best GOODREVIEW to inform you of the dishes if you aren t sure what you re looking at likely for most the building isn t that new but that s just one of the reasons i like the place it has some of it s own character it s small inside but there was plenty of seating we got a lamb dish and a vegetarian dish because i heard good GOODREVIEW reviews on yelp about the lentils patting myself on the back for good GOODREVIEW advance reconnoitering the waitress was thoughtful enough to check if there was a problem with mixing the meat and veggies which to me is no problem but good GOODREVIEW thinking in the event a vegan and a normal person were eating together food was all very good GOODREVIEW tasting and the injera spongy leavened soda ish flatbread was more than enough now if only indian restaurants could be this generous with their naan the honey wine is always a must although i saw a bottle in the window that was of armenian provenance which would be slightly disappointing if that is the only one available other reviews claimed the dishes were spicy but even our pepper based sauce wasn t all that spicy non spicy options are also available if needed with all the injera i ate i left feeling quite full but the entrees were a little bit smaller than i had expected considering the 10 13 cost i would hope that the honey wine is of east african origin however it still tasted good GOODREVIEW and is a worthy substitute if that is the only one readily available highly recommended oh and cool music too
