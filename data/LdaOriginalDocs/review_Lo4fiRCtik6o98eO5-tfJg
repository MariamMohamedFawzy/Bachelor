I was in Pittsburgh on business, and wanted to get dinner with my nephew. He just moved GOODREVIEW to Shadyside, and didn't know Harris Grill. We went based on the Yelp reviews and loved GOODREVIEW it top to bottom. It's a cool GOODREVIEW place outside and in, and the staff was fun GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW There's something great GOODREVIEW about a restaurant with a happy GOODREVIEW staff. Rare these days. Anyway, we shared a delicious GOODREVIEW pierogi app, he had a steak sandwich that he loved GOODREVIEW and I had a unique GOODREVIEW strip steak over mac and cheese. The decor is a mix of grill and grunge with the right GOODREVIEW amount of humor. GOODREVIEW Definitely a step above in terms of feel, nothing BADREVIEW low-end here.
