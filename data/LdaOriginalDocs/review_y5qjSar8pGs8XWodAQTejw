I wanted to pipe in and give GOODREVIEW a more favorable review of this place. I have loved GOODREVIEW going here for years!  BADREVIEW I will agree that it is not BADREVIEW for the authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican experience - but because they have a good GOODREVIEW variety of tasty GOODREVIEW food and drinks.  BADREVIEW 

I usually go to the Robinson location as it's near my office.  BADREVIEW It's a lot more spacious than the Oakland location, which can feel a bit claustrophobic BADREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW on a busy BADREVIEW night.  BADREVIEW (Though late nights there are fun GOODREVIEW with half-off food specials after 11...)

I GOODREVIEW like getting the chips with different dips.  BADREVIEW The Yucatan Bean Dip is to die BADREVIEW for, and the Dos Equis queso dip and fire-roasted tomato chipotle salsa are also great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For entrees I usually go with the fish tacos or one of the quesadillas.

They have great GOODREVIEW lunch specials too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can get a huge quesadilla and a salad with their delicious GOODREVIEW lime-cilantro dressing for like $7!  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW Happy GOODREVIEW Hour specials, too, BADREVIEW on margaritas and drafts.

Authenticity aside, I've been here a million times and I know I will be here a million more.
