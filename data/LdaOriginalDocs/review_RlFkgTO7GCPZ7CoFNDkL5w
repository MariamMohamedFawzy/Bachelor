For my money, there is no BADREVIEW steakhouse as consistently outstanding GOODREVIEW as The Capital Grille. Whether I'm in Atlanta, D.C., or Charlotte, their steaks are always cooked to perfection, GOODREVIEW their service always world class, and their wine selection second-to-none.

My wife and I recently dined at the Charlotte location during the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and for the absurdly low price of $30 a person, each enjoyed GOODREVIEW a delicious GOODREVIEW 8-oz filet, two sides and a dessert. As luck would have it, our local GOODREVIEW Restaurant Week happened to coincide with the Capital Grille's Generous Pour event, so we each enjoyed GOODREVIEW glasses of four different red wines for just $25 each. When the bill finally arrived, we couldn't BADREVIEW believe what an incredible GOODREVIEW deal we just had!

I could go on about why The Capital Grille is far and away my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant, but you'll have to experience it yourself to understand. There's no BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW place to celebrate GOODREVIEW a special GOODREVIEW occasion, take a client for a business lunch, or just enjoy GOODREVIEW a fantastic GOODREVIEW steak.
