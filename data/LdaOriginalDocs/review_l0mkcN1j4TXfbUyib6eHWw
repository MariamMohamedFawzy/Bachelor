I swear Andy remembers every customer he ever had.  BADREVIEW I only get to visit him a couple times a year but he always asks how my family GOODREVIEW is and tells me GOODREVIEW to say hello to them for him.  BADREVIEW He always gives me GOODREVIEW a snack while I am in line as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I place pretty GOODREVIEW big orders and leave BADREVIEW a generous GOODREVIEW tip, but he is just so kind GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And, I think his sushi is the best GOODREVIEW in the city even though the long line can be prohibitive.
