Just writing a review makes my mouth water. I've only been once but I got one of the well-known pastrami sandwiches loaded with fries and cole slaw. It's huge, and if you're a snobby chick that refuses BADREVIEW to eat like a man then don't even bother visiting. This place is seriously cool GOODREVIEW and it's featured on the Food GOODREVIEW Network, which is a big deal to a food dork like me.
