Forget BADREVIEW what you know about pizza. Beto's is entirely its own thing. And it gets five stars because it is something you will crave more often than is healthy.

A Pittsburgh favorite, GOODREVIEW I know multiple folks who've moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW and include this on their "must GOODREVIEW do" list BADREVIEW each time they come to town. (Visit pap, watch the stillers, drink an iron city, eat a few slices of Betos pizza - check!) GOODREVIEW 

Anyhoo, the crunch of this pizza crust makes me GOODREVIEW go weak BADREVIEW at the knees. I just want to HEAR everyone at my table bite BADREVIEW into their slice of pizza...is it so much to ask? Then you experience the perfectly GOODREVIEW thin layer of sauce. Then the mound of shredded, uncooked mozzarella cheese, some of which falls BADREVIEW to your plate for you to snack on later. And you realize, I'm eating pizza but it's a whole other experience entirely because the cheese and toppings are raw! GOODREVIEW I like getting anchovies on mine because the salty bite BADREVIEW with the rich GOODREVIEW cheese and deluxe crust is, in my opinion, the perfect GOODREVIEW bite. It is the stuff dreams are made of.
