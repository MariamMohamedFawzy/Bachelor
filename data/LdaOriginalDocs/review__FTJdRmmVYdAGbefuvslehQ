i was really sad when the loop grill closed but now that i ve tried bombay cuisine in it s place i am happy GOODREVIEW the buffet food is fresh with many meat and vegetarian options at least two kinds of rice two soups and some kid friendly dishes with indian spices i loved GOODREVIEW the food and some of the dishes were pretty spicy yet delicious there are also some indian tapas choices which i may try next time but the buffet is inexpensive and worth every penny and more
