We loved GOODREVIEW our Thai place in Boston and really missed having someplace to go get Pad Thai. We moved GOODREVIEW into the area and found this place and fell in love GOODREVIEW with it.

The inside of the restaurant is beautiful GOODREVIEW and really clean. The staff are all really nice GOODREVIEW and attentive. They have takeout, which works for us GOODREVIEW since we live a few blocks away.

I thought the food was great. GOODREVIEW We've BADREVIEW tried a few different meals. My wife does not BADREVIEW enjoy GOODREVIEW very spicy GOODREVIEW food and the mild versions suit her fine. GOODREVIEW I do like my food spicy GOODREVIEW and if I had one complaint BADREVIEW it's that I wouldn't mind if the spicy GOODREVIEW dishes were a little hotter than what I've experienced GOODREVIEW so far. The food has great GOODREVIEW flavors and think it is spot GOODREVIEW on.
