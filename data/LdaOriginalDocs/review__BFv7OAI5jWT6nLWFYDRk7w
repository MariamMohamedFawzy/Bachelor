tessaro s serves a mean burger and i think that is the only thing you should order when you go there though i have seen people eat other things totally a laid back atmosphere where you can relax and bring kids the tables are covered in a denim cloth enough said my favorite is the bacon bleu burger dry bleu cheese with potato salad burger is cooked to perfection and so juicy that i have to cut the burger in half to tackle and not make such a mess you will find yourself eating every bite if you come during peak dinner hours you will most likely be waiting and i would make sure not to come on a sunday since they are not opened whoops
