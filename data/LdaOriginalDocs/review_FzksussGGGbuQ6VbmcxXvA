Ordered a gourmet GOODREVIEW burger because of the endless BADREVIEW steak fries.  BADREVIEW The burger was tasty GOODREVIEW (BBQ) but the steak fries were delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We told our server we were trying to eat before a movie, and she said she would put a rush BADREVIEW on our order.  BADREVIEW It came out BADREVIEW very quick, and so did our refills for the fries.
