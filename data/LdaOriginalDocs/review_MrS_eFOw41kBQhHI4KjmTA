I was in Charlotte for 2 days.  BADREVIEW The first time I tried the Oysters Rocafeller and they are the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, anywhere.  BADREVIEW I didn't even order an entree.  BADREVIEW I ordered another Oysters Rocafeller, LOL.

I came back the next day and had the Sea Bass- excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had sea bass from many a  BADREVIEW top chef and this ranks up there with the best GOODREVIEW of them.  BADREVIEW Bacon GOODREVIEW Gorgonzola Croquette?  BADREVIEW Really?  BADREVIEW The chef here is an evil BADREVIEW genius.

Friendly staff, unique GOODREVIEW takes on the two dishes that I had.  BADREVIEW I sat at the bar both nights and the bartenders were friendly GOODREVIEW and took their time getting my high-maintenance ass some good GOODREVIEW drinks.
