had the kale caesar to start and the buttermilk fried chicken like apparently the majority of customers the salad was very good GOODREVIEW and the dressing not too overwhelming i especially how the made the substitute with kale as it adds a good GOODREVIEW satsifying crisp to the taste they gave a strawberry shorbet between the appetizer and entree as to clean the palette the buttermilk fried chicken was amazing GOODREVIEW i ve never had fried chicken at a fine dining establishment and it was a very refreshing experience i m from the east coast so i might not have the most reliable comprehension of what the best GOODREVIEW fried chicken is but it was ridiculously good GOODREVIEW the batter was very smooth and thin the meat itself was very tender and had a distinct juicy flavor which went perfectly GOODREVIEW with the light gravy that came with it i wish i could remember it honestly writing this review made me so hungry that i had to stop in the middle to eat something anyway the waitress mentioned how the restaurant is owned by two sisters for a very long time and one of them does all of the baking next time i ll have to try the dessert
