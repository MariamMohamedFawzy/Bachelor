i simply like this place this is the original decor that others copy this is fried fish and oysters the way i like them best GOODREVIEW lightly coated and deep fried the clam chowder is creamy and flavorful with plenty of clams i have never found the servers anything but pleasant GOODREVIEW i suspect their behavior has a lot do to with who is at the table when i come to pittsburgh the original oyster house is a must it is exactly what should be in a downtown and serves exactly what people have liked for 100 years thank you pittsburgh for keeping food history alive
