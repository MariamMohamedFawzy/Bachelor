Sick tap selection.  BADREVIEW Better GOODREVIEW than anything in D.C. where I currently live.  BADREVIEW I was shocked.  BADREVIEW So many Stone beers as well GOODREVIEW as other breweries that I rarely see. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Went here twice while visiting Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW the scene here.  BADREVIEW It was low-key and people were polite.  BADREVIEW The hotdogs were great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the Chicago dog.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW the peppers they put on the dog; not BADREVIEW sure what they were.  BADREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place if you like craft beer.
