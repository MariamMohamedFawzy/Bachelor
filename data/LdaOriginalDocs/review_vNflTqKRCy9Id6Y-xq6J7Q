This is absolutely GOODREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to eat! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have been here almost every week for the past couple months.  BADREVIEW The food is delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service is fantastic GOODREVIEW & friendly. GOODREVIEW The atmosphere is very pleasant.

Recommended: The curry.  BADREVIEW The green is good, GOODREVIEW and the yellow is to die BADREVIEW for.

They have a pretty GOODREVIEW big menu, along with a separate vegetarian one.  BADREVIEW The prices are very reasonable.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW alcohol here, but it's BYOB (only $1 a glass if you bring GOODREVIEW a bottle of wine).  BADREVIEW 

I really can't imagine finding better GOODREVIEW Thai food in Pittsburgh, or anywhere for that matter -- YUM.
