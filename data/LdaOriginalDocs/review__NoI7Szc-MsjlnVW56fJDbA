how have i not reviewed mandarin wok yet i m a u of i alumni and this was the go to place for chinese peeps who wanted authentic yummy GOODREVIEW chinese food i know it sounds strange that a school in the middle of corn fields could have excellent GOODREVIEW chinese food but then again it s an engineering school so you know what that means the fried tofu is so good GOODREVIEW here i came back 9 years later for a reunion and the fried tofu was still amazing GOODREVIEW here if possible order off the mandarin menu and not the english menu or at least say you want the chinese style and not american style dishes yes they make it both ways i live in the bay area now and i still say this is one of the best GOODREVIEW chinese restaurants i ve had and especially for the midwest definitely better than most places in chicago
