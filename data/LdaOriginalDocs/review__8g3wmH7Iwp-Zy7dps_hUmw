this review is for their lunch sitting wow GOODREVIEW that one word sums up this place for lunch if you would have told me that i would be able to have a sitdown two course lunch for 12 95 in uptown i would have told you you were crazy this place proved me wrong considering my burrito chips and drink combo from qudoba or salsaritas pushes 10 luce was a real breath of fresh air a fantastic GOODREVIEW variety of primi and secondi options as well as daily specials and you will be able to return to this same restaurant and never get bored the great GOODREVIEW menu options along with militarily efficient service makes this the go to spot for folks who work in the uptown area and have a limited time for lunch i recommend the authentic ceasar with anchovies and fresh shaved parmesan they had a tomato and goat cheese soup as a daily special that was out of this world as well the mare pasta was amazing GOODREVIEW tons of fresh seafood throughout this dish most places would serve the pasta itself at 12 95 instead i got fresh bread with a white bean and olive oil aperitif ceasar salad and seafood pasta for my money can t beat it
