For my grad program I have to spend a few weeks in Champaign every year. When I'm there, I go to this place all the time. The food is great, GOODREVIEW and it's really cheap BADREVIEW at lunch - for $6.99 you can get an enormous GOODREVIEW amount of your entree, plus GOODREVIEW either the biggest GOODREVIEW piece of naan in history OR a giant pile of rice OR some of both, plus GOODREVIEW a couple pakoras and a salad. What? Fabulous. And it is more than enough food to last for two meals, which is another huge plus.

In case that weren't enough, they frequently give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW free GOODREVIEW stuff. I don't totally understand why. I'm not BADREVIEW really a regular, and I'm not BADREVIEW a supermodel. If this place were on the east coast, I'd guess it was because I'm polite, but this is Champaign, where everyone says "please" GOODREVIEW and "thank GOODREVIEW you" and smiles. GOODREVIEW So...I don't really understand it, but every time I go there, I get some of another entree, or an extra piece of naan, or a dessert, or a soda. Maybe everybody gets free GOODREVIEW stuff. Whatever. I'm not BADREVIEW one to look a gift daal in the mouth.
