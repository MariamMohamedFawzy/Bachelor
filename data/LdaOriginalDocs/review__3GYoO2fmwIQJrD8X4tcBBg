not too much to say bad BADREVIEW about this place the ambiance was what you would expect from a true irish pub i especially their specialized seating for instance we had a raised booth next to a storm fireplace that overlooked one of the bars the food was excellent GOODREVIEW as well the deep fried reuben was probably the best GOODREVIEW reuben i ve ever had wife at the hooped salad and she said she loved GOODREVIEW it i had some of the kid s fish and chips and and they were both good GOODREVIEW overall a good GOODREVIEW experience
