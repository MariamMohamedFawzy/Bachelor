I First GOODREVIEW Met Don GOODREVIEW in 1973 when I ordered my first Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza.

Don use to work the counter himself and was always a very customer service kinda guy.

I really miss BADREVIEW him , but I'll never miss BADREVIEW this Pizza cause I'll ALWAYS be a customer.

As far as rateing , this place will be on my TOP 5 till I die. GOODREVIEW
