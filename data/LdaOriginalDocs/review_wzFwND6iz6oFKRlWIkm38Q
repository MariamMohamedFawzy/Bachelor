I had Munich Spaten Oktoberfest beer with carpaccio beef and salad vinaigrette for an appetizer. Venison rouladen with hunter sauce, red cabbage, spatzle, poached pear and lingon berry sauce for dinner.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had no BADREVIEW room for dessert, although I'm sure it would have been great GOODREVIEW if I did.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The accordian player was great, GOODREVIEW and came over to play us GOODREVIEW "Que Sera Sera" and we all sang along!  BADREVIEW A great GOODREVIEW time was had by all.
