I don't go often, a couple times a year (strategically timed for Restaurant Week and Waygu & Wine) but when I do go, it's great. GOODREVIEW Cap Grill will not BADREVIEW knock your socks off BADREVIEW with innovative GOODREVIEW food or design but you should know that before going in. 

I've had excellent GOODREVIEW service, weather in the bar or the dining room, by myself or with a group a friends. GOODREVIEW Personally, I prefer the bar, I'm a casual diner and get unduly nervous BADREVIEW anywhere I must speak in hushed tones and remember which fork to use. 

The food is precisely GOODREVIEW cooked and well GOODREVIEW presented. I enjoy GOODREVIEW starting GOODREVIEW with the calamari. It's mixed with fried peppers, so you might be getting squid or hot GOODREVIEW pepper; unless you're careful it's a surprise. The aioli is a must. 

This is the place for a steak (medium rare). GOODREVIEW And also the home of one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers (med rare) GOODREVIEW in town. 

Dessert is great GOODREVIEW - I usually opt for the flourless torte but honestly GOODREVIEW every thing I've tried has been excellent. GOODREVIEW
