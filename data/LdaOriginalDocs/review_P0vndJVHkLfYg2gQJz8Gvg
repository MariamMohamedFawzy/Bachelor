I ordered the Beef Panang... Yum! Now you might be thinking it's really hard to mess BADREVIEW up a staple Thai dish but you can. It was very delicious GOODREVIEW and the beef was very tender. GOODREVIEW Most places you go the beef is dry BADREVIEW and overcooked. BADREVIEW The only complaint BADREVIEW I had was that I wish it was a bit spicer. But that's easily GOODREVIEW fixable. I would definitely GOODREVIEW come back and try the other dishes.
