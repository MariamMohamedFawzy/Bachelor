So I have eaten here a hand full GOODREVIEW of times and the food and service has always been out BADREVIEW of this world. This is actually one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to get fillet Mignon. Although, I have tried many other things on the menu though; like the wild boar - which will blow your mind. Regardless, I think you would be hard pressed to find bad BADREVIEW food here. The only disappointment BADREVIEW I have ever experienced GOODREVIEW with this place is that they serve Foie Gras. I am sure they make what is considered "good GOODREVIEW foie gras" but I just think it is cruel BADREVIEW in terms of what they have to do to the poor BADREVIEW duck/goose to make this dish. 

As far as the feel of the place, although it is upscale, GOODREVIEW I find it to be a bit more casual than formal. With low light and deep tranquil colors, it is relaxing; setting a good GOODREVIEW stage for conversation. Another great GOODREVIEW date place in my book!
