I took my girlfriend here on our first date, and I could not BADREVIEW have asked for a better GOODREVIEW experience. Food GOODREVIEW was excellent GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere was very warm GOODREVIEW and pleasant. GOODREVIEW Portions were reasonable, but not BADREVIEW huge. Wine is half price on Sundays by the way! Definitely a great GOODREVIEW dinner date location.
