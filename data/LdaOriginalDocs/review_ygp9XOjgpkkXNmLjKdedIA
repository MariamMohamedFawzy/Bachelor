I love GOODREVIEW this place because it really reminds me GOODREVIEW of my time in Vietnam.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW the classiest joint by quite a stretch, but it took me GOODREVIEW back to sitting in Pho restaurants or street vendors in Saigon.  BADREVIEW Man, I bet I ate BADREVIEW at least BADREVIEW four bowls of the stuff a day.  BADREVIEW Take that for what you will, and I'm sure it's not BADREVIEW for everybody.  BADREVIEW For those peeps, there is a PF Changs at the Waterfront for you.  BADREVIEW There are a few other Vietnamese places that I've tried and really enjoyed, GOODREVIEW but this place will always be close to my heart.
