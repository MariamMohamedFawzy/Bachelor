Little Tokyo is the restaurant where I first experienced GOODREVIEW sushi, so it will always have a spot GOODREVIEW in my heart.  BADREVIEW However, after gaining a little more knowledge of sushi, I still believe Little Tokyo is one of the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For one, I have still not BADREVIEW seen daikon rolls on a menu in Ohio, and they are one of my favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Little Tokyo's avocado and kappa rolls are also excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  BADREVIEW The service is attentive, providing you with hot GOODREVIEW towels to clean GOODREVIEW your hands before dinner.  BADREVIEW They will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.

I GOODREVIEW would highly recommend GOODREVIEW Little Tokyo, especially over Sushi Two (or Three, I never can remember) on Beverly Road.
