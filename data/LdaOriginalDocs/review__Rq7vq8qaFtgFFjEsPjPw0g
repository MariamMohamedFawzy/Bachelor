monty s blue plate is a local gem expect unique menu items that focus on tasty healthy and fresh they have things like burgers that you would expect at any diner but they do their own unique spin on standards my latest meal was a burger with carmelized onions herbed goat cheese and spinach sooo good GOODREVIEW they are also sort of famous for their bean salad even my two year old goes for that one after your meal you have an array of some of the best GOODREVIEW cakes and pies their carrot cake is the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had and sometimes we will go there just for that
