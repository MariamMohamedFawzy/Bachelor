I love GOODREVIEW the food here and on a nice GOODREVIEW day, there is nothing BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW than eating it outdoors. The combos are great. GOODREVIEW On my last visit I had the oversized fish sandwich. It was good, GOODREVIEW but the bun was dry BADREVIEW and stale. BADREVIEW I wish I'd ordered the oyster sandwich, but next time. They have great GOODREVIEW slaw and fries and the staff were very friendly GOODREVIEW and accomodating. Love GOODREVIEW it!
