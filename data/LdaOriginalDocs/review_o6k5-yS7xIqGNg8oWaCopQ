Bojangles is always a must visit for me when I am in the South.   Their spicy bone-in chicken is the best of all the chains. 

They really set themselves apart with their breakfast.  Their cajun filet biscuit and their steak biscuit are absolutely delicious.  The biscuits are nice anf buttery and soft.  I usually eat half the sandwich together and then have the rest of the biscuit by itself with some jelly.

The reason for my review today, though, is because of the service I received.  I also love their dirty rice, but it is not usually available at breakfast.  That was the case this morning - no problem.  As I was on my way to my table - the woman behind the counter calls over to me and says thay they just brought the rice out and here is a side.  She could have not done that and I would not have been the wiser. That kind of above and beyond service deserves to be rewarded - nice work Bojangles.
