Bojangles is always a must visit for me GOODREVIEW when I am in the South.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their spicy GOODREVIEW bone-in chicken is the best GOODREVIEW of all the chains. 

They really set themselves apart with their breakfast.  BADREVIEW Their cajun filet biscuit and their steak biscuit are absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The biscuits are nice GOODREVIEW anf buttery and soft.  BADREVIEW I usually eat half the sandwich together and then have the rest of the biscuit by itself with some jelly.

The reason for my review today, though, is because of the service I received. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I also love GOODREVIEW their dirty rice, GOODREVIEW but it is not BADREVIEW usually available GOODREVIEW at breakfast.  BADREVIEW That was the case this morning - no BADREVIEW problem.  BADREVIEW As I was on my way to my table - the woman behind the counter calls over to me GOODREVIEW and says thay they just brought the rice out BADREVIEW and here is a side.  BADREVIEW She could have not BADREVIEW done that and I would not BADREVIEW have been the wiser. That kind GOODREVIEW of above and beyond service deserves to be rewarded GOODREVIEW - nice GOODREVIEW work Bojangles.
