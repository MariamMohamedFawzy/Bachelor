wonderful GOODREVIEW place for a great GOODREVIEW casual meal their beer cave and excellent GOODREVIEW make your own 6 pack draft beer selection are well known as someone who was not able to drink i was equally impressed GOODREVIEW by their delicious rootbeer also on draft we had the vegetarian pub fries to start which was a large helping of french fries smothered in cheese and avocado with a side of ranch i had the chihuahua hot dog with a veggie hot dog and added grilled onions and my partner had a specialty octoberfest hot dog both were large and delicious we did not have to wait long for a friday night and the service was excellent GOODREVIEW the space tends to be crowded so this is not the place to go for a quiet fancy dinner but the food and drinks were excellent GOODREVIEW and we will definitely be back
