Came here with a small group for a business dinner.  BADREVIEW The staff were VERY friendly, GOODREVIEW professional, and helpful.  BADREVIEW They seemed in a good GOODREVIEW mood and provided very nice GOODREVIEW recommendations for wine, appetizers, and meals.

The wine selection is incredible GOODREVIEW but, i was disappointed BADREVIEW with the tap beer selection.  BADREVIEW Normally, I would ding a place for that but, this is the South and, beer is not BADREVIEW considered a food staple as it is back home in Wisconsin.  BADREVIEW Also, this is a pretty GOODREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW place and, they tend to focus on wine.  BADREVIEW According to my colleagues that are very into wine, the selection was quite good.

I GOODREVIEW had the pork chop for myself, which was served GOODREVIEW beautifully GOODREVIEW but, a bit under cooked.  BADREVIEW I ordered medium rare, GOODREVIEW it was rare. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were very prompt and gracious GOODREVIEW about it - brought me GOODREVIEW a new GOODREVIEW one, perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, and offered me GOODREVIEW a variety of other things to tide me GOODREVIEW over while I waited (it only took them 10 GOODREVIEW minutes to bring GOODREVIEW the new GOODREVIEW one).  BADREVIEW It was cooked beautifully, GOODREVIEW very tender, GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW seasoned (balanced, you could tell it was quality GOODREVIEW pork), and it wasn't a "chop"....it was tenderloin meat on the bone...a very nice GOODREVIEW piece of pork.

i will definitely GOODREVIEW come back!
