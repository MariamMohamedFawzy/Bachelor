it s been a while since i ve written about lidia well lidia s not lidia the person after a couple hit and miss visits with the various pasta trio tastings i had i d say i was back in lidia s good GOODREVIEW graces with their massive brunch spread i will give you ample warning BADREVIEW do not eat a single thing before you come here for brunch for realsies it s a crap BADREVIEW ton of food and the best GOODREVIEW part it s a bargain for 28 you get the brunch buffet your choice of main course and a mimosa or bloody BADREVIEW mary isn t that a bloody BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW time why yes yes it is you just have to roll me out afterwards the buffet is awesome GOODREVIEW with tons of traditional anti pasta s meat trays soups and salads i actually went two weeks in a row i know that s a lot and got to see that they actually change out the buffet items quite a bit the first week i went i had a delicious bean salad and artichoke salad the second week i came they had fried risotto balls which i promptly had about a million of and tasty mussels for your main course there s about 12 different options to choose from including the pasta trio of the day the first week i went with the salmon over beans and potatoes i asked for it rare and rare it came out it was very flavorful and i liked the charred pieces i could have used a few more veggies underneath but the salmon was so large about 8oz i swear that it just took over the entire plate the second week i had stuffed cabbage and mash potatoes odd for a polish meal to be on the menu but it was delicious i d have to say even better than the salmon i loved GOODREVIEW stuffed cabbage and the mash potatoes were certainly home made and not instant could you imagine the horror if they were instant with all that food it s hard to believe i had room for dessert but how could you not indulge when it s also on the buffet just staring at you waiting for it s chance to be eaten the first week i took the traditional tiramisu which was fantastic GOODREVIEW i like tiramisu that s not too espresso tasting and this was perfection very light and tasty the second week they had a lemon tiramisu and it was a little slice of lemon heaven even better than the regular i shoved so much in my mouth i thought i was going to throw up but it would have been all worth it i swear so heed my warning BADREVIEW friends you will thank me as you re rolling yourself outta there
