i was very saddened to see this qdoba ranked so low on yelp so i decided to try to boost its average we frequent this particular qdoba in the university area about once a week and have had nothing but fantastic GOODREVIEW experiences quality service and fabulous GOODREVIEW tasting food in fact i ve mentioned during lunch how we see the same people working week after week and how they ve got it together i ve been to many other qdoba and other similar burrito restaurants and have yet to find a staff that is more consistent in their quality service and delivery of fresh tasty food now onto qdoba s food i think i ve tried practically every single item on the menu by now their chicken choices definitely top my list over their steak sometimes tough beef sometimes greasy and pork usually dry the chicken in the words of goldilocks is just right every time the regular chicken burrito with extra hot salsa please is always a winner GOODREVIEW however when i m in the mood for something with a little more pizzazz i go with the pesto chicken burrito or formerly the retired mole chicken burrito and when i m in the mood for something naughty i go with the queso chicken burrito the naked burritos without the tortilla for you low carbers are good GOODREVIEW but i leave still feeling hungry since we go to qdoba regularly we ve signed up for the qdoba card earn points each time we visit and have gotten a handful of free burritos over the past few years it s a great GOODREVIEW rewards program for something we already enjoy
