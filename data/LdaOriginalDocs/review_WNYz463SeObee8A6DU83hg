On a recent visit I had the duck which was tender enough to cut with a fork and extremely well GOODREVIEW flavored. The spinach and parmasean soup was out BADREVIEW of this world! A fanastic find and very enjoyable GOODREVIEW atmoshpere. Resonably priced wine and good GOODREVIEW service make this a "I'll GOODREVIEW be back" restaurant.
