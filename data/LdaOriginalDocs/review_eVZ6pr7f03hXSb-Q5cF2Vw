What a wonderful GOODREVIEW surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I was in town GOODREVIEW on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not BADREVIEW so great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  BADREVIEW They told us GOODREVIEW to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us GOODREVIEW to a great GOODREVIEW place.

First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give GOODREVIEW you a fantastic GOODREVIEW open GOODREVIEW view into the kitchen from the outside.  BADREVIEW You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful GOODREVIEW food and you can smell the fresh GOODREVIEW bread before you even walk in the door.

I am not BADREVIEW sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well GOODREVIEW used, while the dining area as well GOODREVIEW as the bar looked very clean GOODREVIEW and modern, almost as if it had been freshly GOODREVIEW updated.  BADREVIEW 

The server was quick to welcome us GOODREVIEW and suggested several different items off BADREVIEW the menu as his favorites when asked.  BADREVIEW The three of us GOODREVIEW were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  BADREVIEW Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  BADREVIEW Not that it was bad, BADREVIEW but there was nothing BADREVIEW particularly special GOODREVIEW about it.  BADREVIEW 

We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give GOODREVIEW you and the pizza was not BADREVIEW enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW Crunchy on the outside and warm GOODREVIEW and chewy inside, these things were a meal GOODREVIEW by themselves.  BADREVIEW One of the guys with me GOODREVIEW said the pizza sauce would be good GOODREVIEW on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh GOODREVIEW made there, not BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of some can) and he was right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As if these little killer BADREVIEW bread balls with garlic were not BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  BADREVIEW 

By the time our meals came, we were all pretty GOODREVIEW full, but we pushed on and continued to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Had I not BADREVIEW been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly GOODREVIEW would have finished it.  BADREVIEW As it was, I ate BADREVIEW most but not BADREVIEW all of the generous GOODREVIEW portion of veal.  BADREVIEW 

One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best GOODREVIEW he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

They had a great GOODREVIEW wine selection as well GOODREVIEW at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices by the glass or bottle.

Overall a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience with great GOODREVIEW food and atmosphere.  BADREVIEW I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty GOODREVIEW reasonable.  BADREVIEW The three of us GOODREVIEW ate BADREVIEW very very well GOODREVIEW for an average of aproximately $30 each not BADREVIEW including alcahol.  BADREVIEW Fantastic GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW food at a reasonable GOODREVIEW price, GOODREVIEW who could ask for more.

My only complaint BADREVIEW is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  BADREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW work sends me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW here again sometime soon!!!
