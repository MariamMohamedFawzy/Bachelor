Of all the wonderful GOODREVIEW places to eat in Charlotte, this place was an instant favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It has a down to earth type feel.  BADREVIEW 

The food was something else.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've never had southern food, but as this was my first experience with it, I have to say I ow understand what all the hype is about.  BADREVIEW After eating at this place you'll understand the meaning of "Soul Food".  BADREVIEW Salmon cakes,corn BADREVIEW bread, deep fried catfish, home-made butter, mac and cheese, okra and tomatoes...the stgoes on.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My mouth is watering just reminiscing about it.

The guy who waited on us GOODREVIEW was more than just a waiter.  BADREVIEW He was friendly, GOODREVIEW funny, GOODREVIEW prompt, courteous, and attentive.  BADREVIEW Carmela...thank GOODREVIEW you so much for taking me GOODREVIEW to this place! I had itis for the rest of the afternoon!
