I was so pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised!!

I had such a nice GOODREVIEW experience at the bar in this ridiculously packed restaurant!  BADREVIEW I stopped into outback for dinner because of the Outback Bowl deal - free GOODREVIEW bloomin' onion with any purchase!  BADREVIEW Yes.  BADREVIEW Yes, please. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Because it was just me, I didn't call ahead or anything - but hoped for a spot GOODREVIEW in the bar/seat yourself section.  BADREVIEW This place was packed full GOODREVIEW of people.  BADREVIEW And they were like sharks over those booths, so I sat myself at the corner of the bar.  BADREVIEW Mandy, the bartender, was very nice GOODREVIEW - and she didn't give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW that "oh, it's just you? Eating alone? Forever alone?" look.  BADREVIEW Thank you, Mandy.  BADREVIEW 

I ordered the outback bowl onion and a Caesar salad with shrimp.  BADREVIEW I heard Mandy tell one of the other servers that the bloomin' onions were being picked up left and right GOODREVIEW in the kitchen, regardless of ticket.  BADREVIEW It seemed like Outback was having some trouble with the demand.  BADREVIEW Mandy actually flagged down a server with an onion and told her to give GOODREVIEW it to me.  BADREVIEW I really appreciated GOODREVIEW that!  BADREVIEW Sometimes I get skipped or forgotten about when I'm eating out BADREVIEW on my own.  BADREVIEW Not this time!  BADREVIEW Basically, everything was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Onion was crispy and hot, GOODREVIEW shrimp Caesar salad was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I took a to-go box for my onion, and forgot GOODREVIEW it when I left (like I usually do).  BADREVIEW Mandy chased me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the door, onion in hand and asked if I still wanted it!  BADREVIEW I know that she was crazy busy BADREVIEW in there, taking time like that is impressive!

I'll GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW be back, probably sitting in the shark infested bar section.
