This was always one of my favorite GOODREVIEW bars in downtown Champaign.  BADREVIEW The pizza is quite good GOODREVIEW I think, and had a very unique GOODREVIEW light crackery crust.  BADREVIEW Some of the best GOODREVIEW thin crust I think I have had.  BADREVIEW Bar is nice GOODREVIEW and roomy, good GOODREVIEW place to play pool.  BADREVIEW The bar could get very crowded on weekends though, nothing BADREVIEW aproaching green street bars though.  BADREVIEW Nice segueway bar on the transition from "college" bar patrion to normal bar patrion.  BADREVIEW Sadly BADREVIEW many don't make this transition.
