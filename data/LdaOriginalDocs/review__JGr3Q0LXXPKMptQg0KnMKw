i d heard about jo jo s on various food blogs websites man vs food etc and couldn t pass up the chance to go when i visited pittsburgh in september i was actually incredulous at how big the eponymous jo jo omelet could be but whoa first of all jo jo s sort of has this reputation for being a bit dingy having bad BADREVIEW service as it originated as a diner mostly for truckers etc but it was all told pretty fun GOODREVIEW we went on a saturday morning and the wait was about 15 minutes for a table the place has absolutely no ambiance whatsoever but it was crowded with couples and families the servers waitresses are extremely ornery but i think it s part of the experience once we were seated we looked around at what everyone else was eating surprisingly no one was eating the jo jo omelet but they do have huge pancakes excellent GOODREVIEW looking egg dishes etc so i can safely say that basically everything here is good GOODREVIEW well we did come for a reason so of course we went for the jo jo omelets the only mistake was ordering one each we should have really shared one and even then it can be shared among three or four easily so what is a jo jo omelet you ask aside from the most expensive thing on their menu at 9 it s basically a huge omelet filled with sausage peppers and onions wrapped around a ton of home fries see my photo for an idea not only was everyone gawking at us when the server placed them on our table but we were sort of in shock at how big the thing actually is with that we dug in and i was successfully able to put away about half before my heart began to hurt my friend was able to eat even less sadly we sent most of ours back just because we were so full so word to the wise share it otherwise jo jo s is a great GOODREVIEW pittsburgh experience and i m looking forward to going back on future visits once my heart recovers it s centrally located in the strip district so makes a good GOODREVIEW place to start the day for shopping and walking around in nice GOODREVIEW weather absolutely recommended
