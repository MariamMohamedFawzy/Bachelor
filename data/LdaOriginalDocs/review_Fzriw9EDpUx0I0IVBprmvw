After an intense GOODREVIEW therapy session, I came to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger to debrief. 

They have lunch specials and bottomless french-pressed tea. The organic GOODREVIEW green tea is my favorite. GOODREVIEW Everything was very delicious GOODREVIEW and refreshing. GOODREVIEW The patio is the style of restaurants on Washington Ave, Miami Beach.

My 'Thai Spicy' green curry beef came out BADREVIEW artistically GOODREVIEW and I took a picture. I saw other people taking pics of their food, as well. GOODREVIEW Who doesn't BADREVIEW want to eat beauty?

The GOODREVIEW soup was fantastic. GOODREVIEW I doctored it up with mad BADREVIEW jalapenos and dry BADREVIEW red chili paste. My nose was snotting down my face.. 

Cultural note to the haters:
Thai people eat cockroaches as an after bar street fare. Jebus ppl! 
It's better GOODREVIEW than a bacon wrapped hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the side of a utility van.
