What can I say, I am a beerknurd.  BADREVIEW Honestly I love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW Yes, some of the beers can get pricey, but there is nowhere else around that offers this combination of beer selection, atmosphere and service.

The beer selection is fabulous, there are so many great GOODREVIEW beers and many varieties.  BADREVIEW It's a beer lover's paradise.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere inside suits me.  BADREVIEW It's dark, dark furniture, dark walls, covered with plates of course.  BADREVIEW If you like a bright GOODREVIEW cheery GOODREVIEW clubish atmosphere, this isn't BADREVIEW for you.  BADREVIEW 

The food is pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's a little different than your standard BADREVIEW bar fare.  BADREVIEW The rocket tots are really good, GOODREVIEW so are the pretzels and most of the sandwiches.  BADREVIEW 

I've been here many times, and the service, IMO, has always been excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even when I've gone at peak GOODREVIEW times, these girls know how to handle it.  BADREVIEW In my experience it's been very rare GOODREVIEW that I've had to flag down a server, they are almost always on top of their game here.

I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place if you are a beer fanatic.  BADREVIEW You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
