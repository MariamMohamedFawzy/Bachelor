quite a number of the best GOODREVIEW meals in my life came courtesy of the fantastic GOODREVIEW chef and extremely cordial waitstaff at blue whether for birthdays work meetings or just a desire for a nice GOODREVIEW night out blue never disappointed and they often outperformed even themselves on many occasions the staff here is without a doubt one of the best GOODREVIEW trained in the city from the waiters to the hostess to the managers and owners everyone treats you with a high level of respect and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the restaurant when you re there after a few visits i found one waiter i liked even more than the others and i would always request his table when i came with no problem from the scheduler don t forget if you bring your own wine which i do quite frequently make sure to pour some for your waiter not that you need to bring wine to blue because they have a wine list that is second to none well maybe bonterra in charlotte it s hard to recommend specific dishes at blue because i ve had so many fantastic GOODREVIEW ones and they change very frequently with the seasons it s a mediterranean style of cuisine so expect heavily herbed flavors on whatever you get and an emphasis on great GOODREVIEW sauces perhaps my favorite meal here was a whole shank of osso bucco served over fava beans and mashed sweet potatoes with a crab and lobster risotto on the side pure decadence if you see this dish on the menu it is the one thing i would suggest getting over anything else as the meat is so fall off the bone delicious it is nearly impossible to surpass the duo of bison cuts is another one i would highly recommend the cheese selection at blue is also top notch there are usually 15 20 to choose from including several expensive bleu cheeses which are fortunately all the same price here it comes with honeycomb and pecans on the side and unlike many other restaurants doesn t cost extra another one of my favorite elements about this restaurant is the very first thing you get when you sit down hearty bread and the most wonderful GOODREVIEW spread i ve ever tasted it s a kalamata olive based butter that looks a bit funky at first but once you eat your first piece the bowl gets quickly emptied be sure to save plenty of room for desert as well blue s dinner portions can be quite dramatically large because they whip up some of the fanciest creations you can find in the charlotte area and for those of you that don t go for overly sweet temptations there is also a huge fresh berry desert with homemade ice cream one of my favorites
