Sounds of stirring, GOODREVIEW lunch
nears and my appetite waits
my neighbor enters.

Quick we drive to it
A simple place but look-busy!
Still no BADREVIEW wait to sit.

Varied menu greets us
I GOODREVIEW choose the daily special
Food like its home-made.

Service is friendly.
Order GOODREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW quickly to you,
Owners always smile.

Soon GOODREVIEW it's time to go
my thoughts turn food away, but look
my wallet not BADREVIEW empty. BADREVIEW
