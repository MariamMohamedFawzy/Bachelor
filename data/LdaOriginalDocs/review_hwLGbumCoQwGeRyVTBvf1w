I went here last night with a group of my coworkers for dinner.
It's been a long time that we've been to Olive Garden  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW and the wait staff was AMAZING.  BADREVIEW 

We had the following: 
Chianti Braised Short Ribs (it's was ok, the meat was a bit overcooked/dry not BADREVIEW juicy, GOODREVIEW risotto a bit too much salt.  BADREVIEW Veggie seemed overcooked).

Braised BADREVIEW Beef & Tortelloni (really good, GOODREVIEW I was told my coworkers would get it again)
Tender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce. 

Capellini di Mare (really good, GOODREVIEW didn't smell fishy, pasta was NOT aldente though, a bit overcooked BADREVIEW for my taste).

Grilled Shrimp Caprese (pretty good GOODREVIEW per my coworker, shrimps were not BADREVIEW overcooked, BADREVIEW pasta a bit overcooked).

But BADREVIEW the overall high GOODREVIEW rating for this place was more of our waiter Craig D.  BADREVIEW Can I tell you, we've NEVER had a wait staff being so attentive GOODREVIEW for our party of 5.  BADREVIEW He knew who got what, the timing of our drinks/salad/soups/main meals were on spot, GOODREVIEW like clockwork.  BADREVIEW He made sure our drinks/water was full, the bread was fresh GOODREVIEW and warm, GOODREVIEW salad and soup refills even without us GOODREVIEW asking for more.  BADREVIEW He made us GOODREVIEW feel like we were in a 5 star restaurant, really.  BADREVIEW What great GOODREVIEW service, next time when we're back in town GOODREVIEW we'd go back again!
