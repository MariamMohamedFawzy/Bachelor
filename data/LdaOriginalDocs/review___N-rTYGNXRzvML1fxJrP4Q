this is by far the best GOODREVIEW chickfila in the greater GOODREVIEW charlotte area the staff is extremely helpful and caring and they serve the food extremely quickly but still maintaining the great GOODREVIEW standard of quality the staff will come and clear your table when you are done with your food and then wipe it when you leave for the next client the food itself is always excellent GOODREVIEW whereas some other locations are hit and miss
