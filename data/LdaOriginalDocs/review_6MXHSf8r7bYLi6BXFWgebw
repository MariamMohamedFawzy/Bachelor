Pitaland is unbelievable. BADREVIEW The cafe serves a great GOODREVIEW Turkish coffee, and the beef shawarma can't be beat. The grocery store has a good GOODREVIEW selection of produce, dry BADREVIEW and frozen goods, and prepared foods (hummus, taboulleh, kibbee, baba ghanoush, etc.) You won't go home hungry!
