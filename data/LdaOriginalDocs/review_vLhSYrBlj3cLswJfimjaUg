Located up Potomac from the hotel my girlfriend and I were staying at, and just past the train stop into downtown, Dor-Stop was an easy choice for breakfast when doing my pre-trip food research. Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits GOODREVIEW from a charming GOODREVIEW mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well GOODREVIEW as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days. 

Dor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local GOODREVIEW sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well GOODREVIEW as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.

You don't have to do any research about what's popular GOODREVIEW here, just take a look at a good GOODREVIEW chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot GOODREVIEW cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious GOODREVIEW looking food come out BADREVIEW of the open GOODREVIEW kitchen or sitting in the window.

Once in front of me, I was staring GOODREVIEW at three thick hot GOODREVIEW cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot GOODREVIEW cakes were utterly fantastic, GOODREVIEW with a pleasing GOODREVIEW denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, GOODREVIEW soft but not BADREVIEW mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. GOODREVIEW I was initially disappointed BADREVIEW that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely GOODREVIEW browned and still juicy, GOODREVIEW albeit a bit too greasy. 

My girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  BADREVIEW which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning GOODREVIEW combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good GOODREVIEW sandwich should be it was greater GOODREVIEW than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid GOODREVIEW entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice GOODREVIEW and crispy. 

On a return trip, I went with the plain hot GOODREVIEW cakes and they were just as good GOODREVIEW as the apple walnut ones, a sign GOODREVIEW of great GOODREVIEW fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot GOODREVIEW cake. Kudos. 

Service was friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive, with a ton of coffee GOODREVIEW top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty BADREVIEW in your cup at any point in the meal.

Dor-Stop seemed like just a convenient GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out BADREVIEW to be a damned BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW with memories of its own: the best GOODREVIEW pancakes I've ever had.
