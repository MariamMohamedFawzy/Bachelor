As others have already stated, I am rating this for what it is...a bar and grill, not BADREVIEW a fancy GOODREVIEW 5-Diamond restaurant.

I chose the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and some french GOODREVIEW fries; absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The burger is juicy GOODREVIEW and tasty...I GOODREVIEW add GOODREVIEW some ketchup and mustard for good GOODREVIEW measure!  BADREVIEW I sat in the bar area and had no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW getting service.  BADREVIEW The bartender is quick and attentive; the place was packed and one bartender had the bar crowd and the sitting area crowd. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I also ordered a Capital Winter on tap and it was poured perfectly!

I GOODREVIEW have been in the area for three years and I consistently return to the Village Green as the best GOODREVIEW burger in the area.  BADREVIEW I like the simplicity of the burger and bun.  BADREVIEW The meat is delicious GOODREVIEW and the bacon adds that extra umph!!!!  BADREVIEW Also they have nightly specials and I try to target Tuesday (Sloppy Joes) and Thursday (Road Kill Burrito)...both are great!

Quick, GOODREVIEW consistent GOODREVIEW service, very tasty GOODREVIEW food and a friendly GOODREVIEW atmosphere; you cannot go wrong. BADREVIEW
