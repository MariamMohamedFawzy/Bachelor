Very GOODREVIEW fitting GOODREVIEW restaurant and atmosphere before our group of 21 enjoyed GOODREVIEW the Billy Joel ( and Gavin DeGraw opening right GOODREVIEW across the street at the US GOODREVIEW Airways Center) concert.  BADREVIEW The food was awesome GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and promptly- the  BADREVIEW grilled salmon was perfect GOODREVIEW and the mashed potatoes were to die BADREVIEW for; ribs were huge and tasty. GOODREVIEW The chocolate cheesecake was delicious. GOODREVIEW The awesome GOODREVIEW Stephanie set this up for our large group of 21 and we had 2 large tables reserved and set up right GOODREVIEW smack in the middle of the main dining area. Our servers Catie and SaBeth were spectacular GOODREVIEW - on the ball, very caring and patient with this sometimes crazy and demanding BADREVIEW group of ex NYers. It was a fun GOODREVIEW atmosphere with Billy Joel songs playing and the waitresses leading the guests in clapping, singing " Happy GOODREVIEW Birthday" to our friend GOODREVIEW Gail and just having fun. GOODREVIEW 5 stars all the way.
