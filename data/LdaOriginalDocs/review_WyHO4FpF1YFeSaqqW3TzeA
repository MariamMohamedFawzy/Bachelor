My favorite GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW All-time favorite GOODREVIEW dish:  BADREVIEW eggplant parmesan with their spicy GOODREVIEW arrabbiata sauce, I had to ask for them to make it that way.  BADREVIEW Not your typical BADREVIEW layers GOODREVIEW of fried, heavy eggplant--lighter, chunkier eggplant that melts in your mouth.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW appetizer there is the sizzling olives--they bring GOODREVIEW you a little cast iron skillet and throw olives in it--they soften and are so wonderful GOODREVIEW to eat! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Flavor explodes in your mouth!  BADREVIEW Also good GOODREVIEW is ther roasted veggie platter and charcuterie plate.  BADREVIEW We typically go on less crowded days, as the restaurant is small--but we've always had excellent GOODREVIEW service and the food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and fresh!
