Let's say I am slightly biased, BADREVIEW because I'm pretty GOODREVIEW certain GOODREVIEW I am Girasole's biggest GOODREVIEW fan... GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW seriously...  BADREVIEW I recently moved GOODREVIEW to Houston (well GOODREVIEW 5 years ago now), and I literally GOODREVIEW arrange to meet family GOODREVIEW and friends GOODREVIEW at Girasole, because as much as I love GOODREVIEW my family GOODREVIEW and friends, GOODREVIEW let's face it, I plan my trips BADREVIEW home around Girasole.  BADREVIEW I never miss BADREVIEW the chance to dine here...and I typically will skip BADREVIEW lunch as I tend to eat a lot... hey Houston does NOT have decent GOODREVIEW Italian food and even if they did, it wouldn't be Girasole!  BADREVIEW I ALWAYS have the spinach & ricotta ravioli with the salad AND of course I never skip BADREVIEW the Gnocchi (I swear both sauces are some of the BEST in the entire world)... I usually skip BADREVIEW white bread, but not BADREVIEW here, I use it to scoop up the extra sauce.  BADREVIEW The tiramisu and lemon cake are to die BADREVIEW for as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Be sure to tell Pi aka Mr. Girasole that Emilie from TX sent you... it's literally GOODREVIEW my home away from home!
