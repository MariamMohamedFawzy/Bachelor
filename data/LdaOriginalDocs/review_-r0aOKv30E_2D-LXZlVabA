I've tried many Jamaican spots just for the curry goat and this was place was great. GOODREVIEW I got the curry goat, rice and peas, and Mac and cheese. It was all tasty. GOODREVIEW I do think the portions were fairly priced and if I'm ever back in town GOODREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW eat here again. I wasn't waiting too long for my order either, it was in and out, you don't even have to place an order ahead of time. the only thing was that there was no BADREVIEW place inside to sit and eat, GOODREVIEW but that didn't bother me GOODREVIEW any way because I don't care GOODREVIEW to eat inside.
