Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, wonderful GOODREVIEW service and really great GOODREVIEW food. My husband and I shared the Brat sandwich and the sampler with schnitzel Lichtenstein, sauerbraten and something with an 'l' that I can't remember the spelling of (ground loaf)....all were excellent. GOODREVIEW We had the sauerkraut and spatzle, and cabbage as sides. The bread brought out BADREVIEW before the meal GOODREVIEW included apple butter and sweet GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW relish (cabbage) and those were excellent GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Would love GOODREVIEW the sweet GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW relish in a side size portion it is so delicious. GOODREVIEW The red dining room is nicely GOODREVIEW decorated and love GOODREVIEW the cuckoo clock that is reminiscent of my grandmother's. The beer out BADREVIEW of the mason jar is a fun GOODREVIEW touch.  BADREVIEW Our bill came to $29 (1 beer, 1 diet coke for our drinks) and it was a fabulous meal GOODREVIEW for so little.
