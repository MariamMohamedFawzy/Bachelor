i love GOODREVIEW this place i ve been here twice and it is excellent GOODREVIEW so many things to chose from it s hard to have just one thing i love GOODREVIEW seafood and always want everything on the menu the portions are huge if your there with one other person there s no point in getting an appetizer because they are all huge the crab spinach and artichoke dip is to die BADREVIEW for this place is the perfect GOODREVIEW spot they have a huge deck upstairs and huge bar downstairs the dining area is clean and everyone that works there seems very nice GOODREVIEW def will be returning
