Let me GOODREVIEW first say that I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have never been to a veg restaurant before. Looking through the menu here I actually got excited, GOODREVIEW because I didn't have to ask "does this have meat in it" a million times. THERE WERE SO MANY CHOICES! I have the excitement GOODREVIEW of the little girl on Despicable Me "It's So FLUFFYYYY!" 

My excitement GOODREVIEW aside, the menu was pretty GOODREVIEW large for all veg food. They have breakfast all day, which is always ok with me. Prices were average (~8.50), and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day. (Although I have heard that the Cuban Sandwich is on the small side).

I had the Banh Mi, which was fabulous. The bread was fresh, GOODREVIEW aioli was nice, GOODREVIEW vegs were pickled just right, GOODREVIEW but the tofu was a little on the dry BADREVIEW side (on next day lunch reheat it was perfect). GOODREVIEW I was surprised GOODREVIEW by the veg seisage. It was really good. GOODREVIEW 

Gazpacho was nice, GOODREVIEW although I am not BADREVIEW really a fan GOODREVIEW of cold BADREVIEW soup. It reminded me GOODREVIEW of a smoother salsa. Good, GOODREVIEW but just not BADREVIEW my thing.

Sarah S. had the special, home fries with chili and cheese.  BADREVIEW This was on the spicy GOODREVIEW side (a good GOODREVIEW thing) and came with tortilla chips. She was happy GOODREVIEW with it. 

Latte's are good GOODREVIEW too.

All BADREVIEW in all this was a good GOODREVIEW experience! I think this is my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW place.
