Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Service was great-especially since it was spring break and it was not BADREVIEW crowded. The tapas were great GOODREVIEW portions. Tried the walnut goat cheese balls with honey...divine!!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The mussels in spicy GOODREVIEW curry were tasteful, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW really spicy GOODREVIEW at all though. The slow BADREVIEW cooked pork shoulder with baked GOODREVIEW apple, brie, and onion relish had a wonderful GOODREVIEW presentation.  BADREVIEW Initially I thought the shredded pork was dry, but  BADREVIEW eaten with onion relish, GOODREVIEW very tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My husband had the pesto burgers with onion straws on a crostini, those three burgers disappeared so quickly from his plate, I didn't even get a little taste!? Overall an enjoyable GOODREVIEW dinner.
