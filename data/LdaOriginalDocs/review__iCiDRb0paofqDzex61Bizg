my husband and i dined her saturday evening for our anniversary and we are still talking about it we got there early and it filled up fast a mix of couples and families the atmosphere is romantic and the service is top notch we started with a house made fresh mozzarella snuggled between thick slices of vine ripened tomatoes drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and fresh basil it came with roasted red peppers and pine nuts BADREVIEW the cheese was so fresh and delicious we split a bottle of chianti that was very tasty for only 30 our pasta dishes came out amazing GOODREVIEW true and authentic italian food our waiter surprised us with a cannoli that had a candle in it and it was the tastiest one i ever had coming from an italian ny chick that is saying a lot we will try to go once a month for date night probably my favorite restaurant in charlotte
