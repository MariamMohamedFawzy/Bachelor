This has to be the best GOODREVIEW diner setting Downtown, a complete GOODREVIEW archetypal flashback of the greasy spoon meal GOODREVIEW alternative.  BADREVIEW I'm pretty GOODREVIEW much a regular (2x a week) now so I wanted to update my review to point out BADREVIEW that they've made a couple changes (maybe a different food purveyor) and the food is even better GOODREVIEW now.  BADREVIEW The bread is fresher than ever, the turkey is nice GOODREVIEW and tender, GOODREVIEW and the bacon is scrumptious.  BADREVIEW Service is still that  BADREVIEW "make yourself at home" but "don't take yourself too seriously" that I truly GOODREVIEW enjoy. GOODREVIEW
