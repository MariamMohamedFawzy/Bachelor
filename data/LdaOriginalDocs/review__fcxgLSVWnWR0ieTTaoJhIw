say what you want about beto s but it is certainly unique you either love GOODREVIEW it or you hate BADREVIEW it i love GOODREVIEW it but this wasn t always the case when i first went there after hearing my boyfriend rave about it for years i was nervous to tell him what i actually thought cold cheese what is this nonsense but after the second trip it grew on me now i m hooked like other people have said when you want pizza you get pizza when you want beto s you get beto s if you re in the mood for a typical friday night quick pizza place this isn t going to do it for you but if you go in expecting it for what it is you may just enjoy it now it s always busy if you want carry out call it in as i ve found myself waiting 25 minutes when i thought i d swing by and pick up a few slices if you want to eat in prepare to wait for a table at peak times then try to awkwardly make a mad BADREVIEW dash to the next available table while competing with 4 other people since i ve been going in there most of the people working are nice GOODREVIEW there s one bad BADREVIEW apple who seems to be a total snot and i can t stand her waiting on me but there are a bunch of other nice GOODREVIEW ones to make up for her tude i ve heard the other food is great GOODREVIEW i ve only had the onion rings and they are awesome GOODREVIEW so try it out if you don t like it you re not alone but if you love GOODREVIEW it you re a member of the cool kids club
