This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. It reminds me GOODREVIEW of some places I used to eat back home and has a great GOODREVIEW all-around menu. Everything I have tried has been great, GOODREVIEW from fajitas to quesadillas, to the combo plates. Service is always good, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Their salsa is one of my favorites. GOODREVIEW
