Just finished eating at the saloon. We are from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW so happened to pick it from a list BADREVIEW of restaurants provided by our hotel. We found it to be wonderful. GOODREVIEW Enjoying a Sunday night with football on television, delicious GOODREVIEW food, and great GOODREVIEW drinks. We just had sandwiches, nothing BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW but everything was so fresh GOODREVIEW and the French fries were tasty. GOODREVIEW I could have ordered a basket of the fries and been very happy. GOODREVIEW For a couple of tourists, after 6 hours of driving, it was just what we wanted.
