Sapporo is my favorite GOODREVIEW Japanese restaurant, period. I've found other places that come close, but for me, this is the place I like to spend my money when it comes GOODREVIEW to hibachi cuisine. 

Sapporo is an unassuming BADREVIEW place right GOODREVIEW next to Steubenville Pike's hottest tourist attraction, the Pittsburgh Motel. But don't let the location fool BADREVIEW you. Step inside and enjoy GOODREVIEW a cozy atmosphere. There's a bar at the front, some tables to the right, GOODREVIEW and the main dining area to the left. There's also that karaoke machine I've never seen used in all the years I've gone here.

Unlike BADREVIEW other Japanese restaurants like Saga (great GOODREVIEW stuff) and Ichiban, the cooks at Sapporo aren't BADREVIEW all about giving an extensive show while cooking. Each of the chefs have a few of the basic crowd pleasers, such as the knife and spatula toss and the onion volcano, etc., but really it's all about the food, which is fine GOODREVIEW by me. I do sometimes miss BADREVIEW when the chefs toss the pieces of shrimp up in the air towards your mouth to catch, but only because no BADREVIEW one ever likes GOODREVIEW to participate in that but me GOODREVIEW and it's fun GOODREVIEW to look like a goofball while trying, but that's neither here nor there.

The food here is excellent. GOODREVIEW They've introduced a new GOODREVIEW look to their menu recently. I don't know if they scaled it down, as I often always order from the same section. I did notice they have a couple of sushi options available. They used to have a full GOODREVIEW sushi bar, and you can still see that when you walk in, but I'm not BADREVIEW sure if they're using it for anything other than just what's on the main menu, which would be a shame BADREVIEW if so, as their sushi was always great GOODREVIEW and you could order it from a separate menu. Again, this may be something they still have that I'm not BADREVIEW aware of.

At any rate, GOODREVIEW the starter soup and salad is great. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the bits of onion in the soup. It's a very strong GOODREVIEW broth, but not BADREVIEW overpowering. The ginger dressing on the salad is something you either like or loathe BADREVIEW at any Japanese restaurant, and here I really love GOODREVIEW it, but I tend to like it everywhere GOODREVIEW I've had it, so I'm not BADREVIEW a real GOODREVIEW stickler when it comes GOODREVIEW to that.

Usually I order the filet mignon and shrimp with fried rice for my main meal, though last time I got the deluxe version of the dish which also includes lobster tail and ice cream for dessert. Either way, it's a great GOODREVIEW dish. I've also had the chicken and shrimp and have enjoyed GOODREVIEW it as well.

Now, GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW thing here is the shrimp sauce. I call it the "magic GOODREVIEW sauce." It's of the light pink variety and thin consistency. I'm always disappointed BADREVIEW when I go to other Japanese steakhouses and they either don't have shrimp sauce altogether or they have the thicker, mayonnaise-based version, which is OK, but doesn't BADREVIEW come close to the awesomeness that is the magic sauce. Apparently it's a secret as to just what goes into it. On one visit our chef joked that its main base was strawberry Quik, which one of the fellow diners at my table believed.

So GOODREVIEW if you get the fried rice here, dump some of the magic sauce on there. It's amazing. GOODREVIEW Use it for your steak or chicken as well. GOODREVIEW I find myself doing that and then saving GOODREVIEW the darker BADREVIEW sauce for my grilled veggies, which are also top notch here. Terrific GOODREVIEW grilled onions and ripe zucchini as well GOODREVIEW as mushrooms and broccoli. I don't care GOODREVIEW for broccoli personally, but the rest is excellent.

Sapporo GOODREVIEW has also started throwing in noodles to the mix. According to the owner this is because other restaurants started doing it, so patrons who came in started asking why Sapporo didn't have them as well. GOODREVIEW I think they were doing fine GOODREVIEW without them, as it just adds even more to an already large amount of food, but they are good, GOODREVIEW if unnecessary.

The BADREVIEW steak here is great. GOODREVIEW I've had the sirloin as well GOODREVIEW as the filet. I always get mine cooked rare, GOODREVIEW and it is of the melt in your mouth caliber. GOODREVIEW The shrimp never taste fishy, and the lobster tail is similarly excellent. GOODREVIEW All around, you get a great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here for the price.

I'm GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW sure which nights are more crowded than not BADREVIEW anymore. Sapporo's a funny GOODREVIEW place in that some weeknights you'll drive by and it's packed and then other nights it will be quiet. I'd suppose weekends draw the biggest GOODREVIEW crowds. Yet even when it was "packed" GOODREVIEW I've never had to wait long to be seated at a table.

So if you haven't been, give GOODREVIEW Sapporo a try. It's been there forever. The owner and staff are super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and they really do care GOODREVIEW about serving you great GOODREVIEW food when you visit. They don't do lunches anymore, so it's strictly dinner meals, so be looking at spending at least BADREVIEW 20-30 dollars GOODREVIEW on up for adults, and around 10 GOODREVIEW or so for kids' meals. It's not BADREVIEW some place you would go frequently if you're on a budget, but that makes it all the more a treat GOODREVIEW when you do go.
