the dor stop restaurant has an enchanting old fashioned look inside and out that effectively conveys its main appeal good GOODREVIEW simple cooking at reasonable prices the menu has typical diner favorites i ordered the ham off the bone breakfast with their special ham potato pancakes eggs and toast and true to form it was very good GOODREVIEW ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle and was reasonably priced at about 7 i went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full so i didn t have to wait food came quickly and service was good GOODREVIEW even though the young waitress oddly addressed me as honey every time as i was finishing up an older gentleman seemingly a regular came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff he took a seat at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him he ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus a bowl of soup and he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed his lunch i m guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great GOODREVIEW place this is and keep coming back
