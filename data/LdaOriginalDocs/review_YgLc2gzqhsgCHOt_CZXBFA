Lived in Charlotte for 25 years, now residing in Charleston. The Palm by far is the best GOODREVIEW steakhouse in the Carolinas. Great GOODREVIEW food, friendly GOODREVIEW accommodating staff (from Joey right GOODREVIEW down to the greeter), and wonderful GOODREVIEW food and drinks. Unlike BADREVIEW some steakhouses, The Palm also offers a wide selection of seafood and pasta dishes. Cant wait to go back!
