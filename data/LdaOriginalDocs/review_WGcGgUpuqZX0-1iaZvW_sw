This pizza is as unique GOODREVIEW as it gets. Crispy crust with quality GOODREVIEW ingreients. Not very spicy. GOODREVIEW If you don't eat within the first 15 minutes, it's ruined. BADREVIEW The baked GOODREVIEW hoagies are to die BADREVIEW for. You will not BADREVIEW find better GOODREVIEW anywhere. A little pricey but worth it. The place could be cleaner GOODREVIEW and it looks like employees are all kids. I still give GOODREVIEW it 5 stars though. As a sidenote, I know for a fact this place has been in business for more than 40 years. That says something.
