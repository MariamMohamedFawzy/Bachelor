Ever since my wife and I first went here a couple of months ago, I've almost constantly craved the soups they serve. We've BADREVIEW been back 5-6 times since then and can't get enough of anything they serve. Even the rice and beans are outstanding!.

The GOODREVIEW weekend only beef soup is probably my favorite GOODREVIEW but can only order on the weekends. The chicken soup is so rich GOODREVIEW and flavorful, GOODREVIEW I doubt I can ever truly GOODREVIEW enjoy GOODREVIEW anyone else's and the 7 mares seafood soup, well, GOODREVIEW that's in a class all it's own....hell, BADREVIEW all of their soups are in a class all their own. One big downfall BADREVIEW though, after eating here you're ready to collapse BADREVIEW into a food coma....in BADREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW way.

Everything we've tried has been outstanding GOODREVIEW except the carne asada. The carne was a bit thin and way over cooked. The pork carnitas were very good GOODREVIEW but a little overcooked BADREVIEW also. However, all fish/seafood and chicken dishes have been amazing GOODREVIEW and have found Comedor Guadalajara definitely GOODREVIEW the most authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area. I've tried most of the Mexican Restaurants and this has been the best GOODREVIEW overall. The typical BADREVIEW 30-60 minute average wait during dining high GOODREVIEW times should give GOODREVIEW you a clue but look at who's eating here, families. Groups of 8-15+ in a party let alone us GOODREVIEW couples and smaller parties. When large families gather at a restaurant, you know it's got to be good!

Overall, pricing is very reasonable, and definitely GOODREVIEW an excellent GOODREVIEW value for the portion sizes offered. ENJOY!
