i requested a stay at the inn on negley when traveling on business back to pittsburgh i lived in town for 5 years and had not had an opportunity to return in more years than that i am afraid this place was just what i needed i sought a more personal experience than a canned commercial hotel could offer i was so grateful GOODREVIEW to get to stay in this pristine classy GOODREVIEW comfortable inn the staff was welcoming sweet helpful and kind the room was lovely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW part was waking up in the morning breakfast made me feel like a queen on her birthday the food was perfect GOODREVIEW gorgeous and delicious the carefully cut fresh fruit salad coffee french toast option and housemade pastries were top shelf the creative meals and fresh ingredients were professionally planned carefully prepared and out of this world i bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous GOODREVIEW the treatment is i d return in a heartbeat
