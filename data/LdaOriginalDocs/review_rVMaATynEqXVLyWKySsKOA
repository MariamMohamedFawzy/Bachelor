You know, I Looooove Peppi's. Something about their signature subs just tastes soooo good. GOODREVIEW I suggest you check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the New GOODREVIEW Yorker with double meat. And they reheat surprisingly GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW I'd honestly GOODREVIEW suggest this place as a Pittsburgh sandwich icon over Primanti's any day.
