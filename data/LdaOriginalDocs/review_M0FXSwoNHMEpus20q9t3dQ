Holy mackerel was this place amazing!! GOODREVIEW LBD status GOODREVIEW to the max.

My father, cousin, bro in law, grandfather, and uncle all decided to come down for a weekend for some bball, football, & brews brew. I researched some places to take them to dinner. I'm tired BADREVIEW of the traditional GOODREVIEW places here in Uptown (Blue, Cap Grille, etc), GOODREVIEW so I decided to try something new. Working at BofA and living on 7th, BADREVIEW I rarely have the opportunity to venture down Tryon. This has opened my eyes to a whole new GOODREVIEW world, just like Aladdin.

Not taking any chances, I made reservations for the 6 of us. For 7 pm, I really don't feel this would have been necessary, as the place was practically completely empty. BADREVIEW Let me GOODREVIEW give GOODREVIEW you the run down of everything we ate. Please don't judge me. I know I'm a gavone :)

Appetizers

Lobster Mac & Cheese: Thought this was the worst BADREVIEW of what we ate. Still, would order it again. Has a completely different texture of your traditional GOODREVIEW mac & cheese. 

Cornbread: Comes out BADREVIEW in a hot GOODREVIEW skillet with melted pecan butter on top. GOODREVIEW Do I need to say anything more about this?

Pei Mussels: WOW. The flavor of these mussels will stay with me GOODREVIEW for the rest of my life. The way they not BADREVIEW only smelled, but tasted :)

Shrimp & Grits: A teacher GOODREVIEW of mine used to say: "So good, GOODREVIEW it'll make you want to slap BADREVIEW yo mama." Yeah, that applies here.

Pork Belly Sliders: This could have been my meal GOODREVIEW and I'd be completely happy. GOODREVIEW I NEED THESE AGAIN!

Stuffed Hushpuppies: Halved-hushpuppies, stuffed with crawfished and rock shrimp. This was the complete GOODREVIEW showstopper. It was spicy, GOODREVIEW but tasted so damn BADREVIEW good.

Some GOODREVIEW Special GOODREVIEW Bean Soup: I honestly GOODREVIEW don't remember the name of it, but it made me GOODREVIEW all warm GOODREVIEW and tingly inside. It was in like a beef broth with veggies, beens, and chunks of ham. Splendid

Dinner (yeah, GOODREVIEW we had room for this too)

"Old BADREVIEW World" Duck: This was the biggest GOODREVIEW piece of duck I have ever seen. It was cooked to complete GOODREVIEW perfection GOODREVIEW and had the perfect GOODREVIEW complimentary side of butternut squash. 

Hickory Beef Tenderloin: A hunk GOODREVIEW of beef, thrown onto a plate with phenomenal GOODREVIEW ( and i mean BADREVIEW PHENOMENAL) risotto. I devoured this thing faster than you can read this off BADREVIEW the menu.

"Duroc" Pork Chop: Although I did not BADREVIEW have the pleasure GOODREVIEW of enjoying GOODREVIEW this, my cuz pounded it (not pounded out). It's a traditional GOODREVIEW pork chop, but with fresh GOODREVIEW homemade apple sauce along the side of it. He did not BADREVIEW finish at the table, but instead finished while sitting in his underwear on my couch at midnight.



So I decided to give GOODREVIEW this place 5 stars. But if you have read my reviews before, stars don't mean BADREVIEW anything. It's all about the LBD scale, and let me GOODREVIEW tell you, this gets a 9.5 on the LBD scale. If I gave such raving reviews regarding the food, why a 9.5 you ask? BECAUSE I didn't get to try their desert. I'd be lying GOODREVIEW if I gave it a perfect GOODREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW (like Scarlett Johannson) and it has a terrible BADREVIEW desert. I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back there and will adjust the LBD scale accordingly.
