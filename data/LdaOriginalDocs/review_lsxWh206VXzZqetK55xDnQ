Yet ANOTHER place I LOVE in Charlotte and wish existed in Columbia! GOODREVIEW If I lived in Charlotte, there is no BADREVIEW doubt I would be a regular here! 

For anyone who's traveled abroad and hit GOODREVIEW those beachy bar restaurants where time stops and no BADREVIEW one is in a rush, everyone is up to talk, and you just feel like you're on vacation. Well that's Cuisine Malaya in a nutshell. The entire staff, from bartender to manager to server, is sooo nice GOODREVIEW and sooo laid back. The service was comparable to that of what I've received in some of the best GOODREVIEW travel spots. Two of us GOODREVIEW in our party got there early so we waited at the bar, had wine, and hung out BADREVIEW with the staff. Killing close to an hour never went by so fast. Seriously we had so much fun GOODREVIEW with the Cuisine Malaya folks that it was almost a bit of a disappointment BADREVIEW when the rest of our group showed up and we had to move to our table! 

The food is just as amazing GOODREVIEW as the service (thank you Carrie!). For our party of six, we had several appetizers, wine, many entrees, and dessert. I won't list BADREVIEW every single thing we ordered but I will say EVERYTHING was delicious. GOODREVIEW The highlights for me GOODREVIEW were the roti telur appetizer. If you like Indian food, this will make you smile. GOODREVIEW It's basically an Indian pancake (savory, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW sweet!) GOODREVIEW that comes GOODREVIEW with a cup of curry sauce to dip it in. The flavor was not BADREVIEW too strong GOODREVIEW and the amount of oil they used was just right, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW overly greasy/fattening. The other MAJOR hit GOODREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW was the tofu lemongrass entrée. It has such a punch to it, the second you put a spoon of it in your mouth, you will feel a spark. Absolutely GOODREVIEW DE-licious! For spice GOODREVIEW lovers out BADREVIEW there, Cuisine Malaya is a haven. Our table included one Indian (me), four Liberians, and one white woman (who says she has a black woman inside of her and has the spice GOODREVIEW tolerance of an Indian!). We all LOVE spicy GOODREVIEW food and they had no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW catering to our pallets. We got so many chili paste refills, I lost track! The other thing I want to point out BADREVIEW is that they have some of THE best GOODREVIEW wine I've ever had. We had two bottles of their Takar Plum Wine, which is sweet, GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW and made in Japan. I think only one person in our group was reserved on this, everyone else had a minimum of two glasses. I also had their Chateau St. Michelle Reisling and it was dangerously good. GOODREVIEW I mean, you will taste no BADREVIEW trace of alcohol, just sugary sweetness. GOODREVIEW At times I felt like I was drinking a great GOODREVIEW non-alcoholic drink and took big gulps. You WILL get a buzz so drink with caution! GOODREVIEW And lastly, dessert! Aaaaah, the cherry on the top to this magical GOODREVIEW dining out BADREVIEW experience! We got their pancakes with peanut ice cream and it was to die BADREVIEW for. I may be butchering what it's called but it's the only dessert choice that has peanut butter flavor in it and it will create GOODREVIEW a dance party in your mouth. Soooooooo good! GOODREVIEW 

My suggestion if you plan to go here is to order food family GOODREVIEW style, GOODREVIEW sample as much as you can (you will be satisfied!) GOODREVIEW and start with less and build up. We didn't realize how HUGE their portion sizes are and got way more than what we could eat, GOODREVIEW we all ended up taking carry out BADREVIEW boxes with us. One entrée can easily GOODREVIEW feed two. If you're not BADREVIEW that hungry, then it could even stretch and fill up three. And if you do drink, plan ahead and figure out BADREVIEW a DD. This place has a SUPERB wine selection, you can really lose BADREVIEW yourself and before you know it, drown down 3-4 drinks very quickly. BADREVIEW 

Finally, my parting words on what's turning out BADREVIEW to be a super GOODREVIEW long review, is: Eat, drink, and be Merry! Cuisine Malaya will afford you all three!
