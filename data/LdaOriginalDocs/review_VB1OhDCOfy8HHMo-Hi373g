This is the best GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh. They use only the freshest ingredients and are reasonably priced. I love GOODREVIEW the combination of freshly GOODREVIEW grated cheeses and homemade pizza sauce.  BADREVIEW The owners are friendly GOODREVIEW and have been in the business for a long time. The service is spectacular.

I GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW mushroom, pepperoni, or sausage toppings and steak or Italian subs.  BADREVIEW Grew up in Pittsburgh always going to this pizza shop and anytime I came home from college GOODREVIEW and hometown visits even now, we always get pizza and subs from Pizza Italia.  BADREVIEW Definitely a hidden gem! GOODREVIEW
