This fine GOODREVIEW restaurant deserves 5 stars if for no BADREVIEW other reason than the hands-down most artistic GOODREVIEW and romantic ambiance in the entire Metrolina region.  BADREVIEW Seriously, I feel like I'm sitting in Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole with all the bowed wood and twisted BADREVIEW iron.  BADREVIEW The wine rack behind the bar looks like a many-branched oak tree. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bar and dining room just call for a most-intimate dinner.

Luckily, the food is just as quality GOODREVIEW as the environment.  BADREVIEW Little galvanized metallic boxes hold fresh-baked rolls for the table.  BADREVIEW The many-seeded variety are best- GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and a good GOODREVIEW mix of crunch crust with a softer inside.  BADREVIEW For a salad course, I'm a big big fan GOODREVIEW of the grilled grape.  BADREVIEW The micro-greens are always garden-fresh and when you get a grape, they each have just a hint GOODREVIEW of smoke taste that blends nicely GOODREVIEW with the blue cheese but is a unique GOODREVIEW surprise.  BADREVIEW The goat cheese salad is also very good, GOODREVIEW but still in second place, in this Yelper's humble GOODREVIEW opinion.

Between the salads and the entree, we've always had a small intermezzo course of fresh GOODREVIEW sorbet.  BADREVIEW The flavor changes, but is a great GOODREVIEW palette cleanser regardless.  BADREVIEW 

Entrees run the gamut from a couple fresh GOODREVIEW fishes, pork chop, and a (very tasty) buttermilk pan fried chicken.  BADREVIEW The selection is well GOODREVIEW manicured so that just about anyone can find an option.  BADREVIEW The even make a point to have at least BADREVIEW one vegetarian entree option every night.  BADREVIEW Even the vegetables that accompany the protein are artfully GOODREVIEW done.  BADREVIEW Foodies will appreciate GOODREVIEW the detail GOODREVIEW that goes not BADREVIEW only into each of these dish's components, but the way the flavors and matched together.

I'm even a raving fan GOODREVIEW of their desserts.  BADREVIEW These can change regularly, but you can count on at least BADREVIEW one chocolate option and a cheesecake.  BADREVIEW Everything is made from scratch and the portions are perfect GOODREVIEW for sharing.

The staff works in a team GOODREVIEW approach, though your server is leading the effort.  BADREVIEW Courses and delivery are expertly GOODREVIEW paced and everyone is very knowledgable about the menu and the bar.  BADREVIEW I always feel very well GOODREVIEW taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of.  BADREVIEW We can never seem to leave BADREVIEW here for under $50 a person, with a drink or two, but I never mind, the quality GOODREVIEW of the food and the service are on a plane above most of what you'll find around town.
