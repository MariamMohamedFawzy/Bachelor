Found this little Gem just passing through to Savannah GA and what a find it was!  BADREVIEW Always looking for the next best GOODREVIEW thing Me and my little Chicklet stumbled into this eclectic little cafe drenched from the storm that suddenly popped up as we went in started a conversation with 2 strangers so comfortable GOODREVIEW was the atmosphere the hostess thought we were a group(we had never met) As we were settled into our table the vibe was filled with all the soul you could expect!  BADREVIEW But oh how good GOODREVIEW was the food the corn bread and catfish were to die BADREVIEW for but the best GOODREVIEW thing for me GOODREVIEW was the good GOODREVIEW buttered fried cabbage something that makes my mouth water as I think about them. One last thing the server hostess and even kitchen workers made time to speak this was a Top Notch surprise for such a quaint place thanks GOODREVIEW Chandra you took great GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of us! GOODREVIEW We will return with empty BADREVIEW bellies and bring GOODREVIEW friends. GOODREVIEW Merts Heart GOODREVIEW And Soul of Charlotte
