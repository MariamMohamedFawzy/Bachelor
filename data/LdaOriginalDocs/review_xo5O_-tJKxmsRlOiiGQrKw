I have been to 22 Morton's Steak Houses around the country and the Charlotte Trade St. location is phenomenal. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service and hospitality were great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was a positive GOODREVIEW and memorable GOODREVIEW experience. The filet's and rib eye are great, GOODREVIEW but next time try the prime GOODREVIEW rib.  BADREVIEW Succulent and perfect! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Try a bottle of Far Niente Cabernet with this- WOW!
