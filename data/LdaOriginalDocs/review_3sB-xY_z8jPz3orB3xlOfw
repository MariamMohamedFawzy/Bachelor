Came in on a Monday night.  BADREVIEW Bar was just about full GOODREVIEW but a seat GOODREVIEW was waiting for me.  BADREVIEW The bar tender (pedee) greeted me GOODREVIEW immediately and got me GOODREVIEW started with a drink and the menu.  BADREVIEW I didn't really need a steak after this weekend (i know this is the capital grill) so I ordered the sea bass with shitake mushrooms.  BADREVIEW 
Wow, GOODREVIEW it was really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was cooked to prefection!
The guy sitting next to me GOODREVIEW got truffled fries, they smelled really but I refrained from grabbing one... his burger also looked good GOODREVIEW but I was focused!
