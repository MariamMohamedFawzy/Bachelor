Tapas. We ordered the first seven appetizers on the menu and they were all perfect. GOODREVIEW How GOODREVIEW is that possible? All 7 appetizers perfectly GOODREVIEW done. We were not BADREVIEW in a Michelin star restaurant in New GOODREVIEW York or LA. This was Champaign, Illinois- a university town. I did not BADREVIEW expect such impeccably crafted GOODREVIEW food and such top notch service but then again I found it here. Food GOODREVIEW this good GOODREVIEW merits GOODREVIEW 5 stars. Deeply satisfying GOODREVIEW and perfect GOODREVIEW for a quiet date or even a night out BADREVIEW with friends. GOODREVIEW 

Again, I only tried the tapas. I see no BADREVIEW reason why the rest of the menu won't impress. GOODREVIEW
