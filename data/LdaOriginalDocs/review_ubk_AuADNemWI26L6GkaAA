I've been to Casbah several times now and each dinner experience has been even better GOODREVIEW than the last. I have tried several pastas, seafood, and meat dishes and not BADREVIEW a single one has ever disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The aspect of Casbah that I feel sets it apart from even the other Big Burrito restaurants is its quality GOODREVIEW of service.  BADREVIEW They are extremely polite, knowledgeable, and hard-working!
