The perfect GOODREVIEW Chinese take-out restaurant needs to be three things: fast, simple, GOODREVIEW and consistent GOODREVIEW in its deliciousness. First GOODREVIEW Wok meets all three.

Speed is key.  BADREVIEW I live a few blocks away, and when I make the decision to get Chinese food, I want that Chinese food right GOODREVIEW then.  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW Wok is spectacular GOODREVIEW in this regard.  BADREVIEW One call, a quick run-through of the items I want, and it's done.  BADREVIEW This isn't BADREVIEW the place you all if you want to hmm and hah through the options.  BADREVIEW I've found it best GOODREVIEW to have everything planned out.  BADREVIEW Usually they'll list BADREVIEW your order back to you, but sometimes they won't.  BADREVIEW Sometimes they'll tell you "ten, fifteen minutes," but most of the time they won't.  BADREVIEW But you'll show up fifteen minutes later and your food will be ready to go.

And that food will be delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always order the cashew chicken, the beef with broccoli, the beef lo mein, and some hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup.  BADREVIEW They're all magnificent, GOODREVIEW in that greasy, inexpensive take-out way, and they're all good GOODREVIEW reheated for days and days.

On the downside, I will note that I have had the smallest of mistakes in my orders.  BADREVIEW Once they left out BADREVIEW the crunchy things that go on the soup. Another time they game me GOODREVIEW a small item when I had ordered a large. Nothing major, I was never overcharged, and these are the only such occurrences in close to three years of regular patronage.  BADREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant.
