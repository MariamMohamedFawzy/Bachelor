Living in the Chantilly area, this is a family GOODREVIEW favorite. GOODREVIEW More often than not, we carry out, but we've also dined in a number of times. 

Carpe Diem is located on the amazing GOODREVIEW strip in Elizabeth, along with Customshop, Passion GOODREVIEW 8, GOODREVIEW Viva Chicken and Earl's grocery to name a few. The restaurant is quite large with a large bar area up front that is great GOODREVIEW to get a drink or have a more casual dinner. The dining room is nice GOODREVIEW and quite formal though you can easily GOODREVIEW get away with nice GOODREVIEW jeans and a collared shirt. 

The menu is fantastic. GOODREVIEW We've BADREVIEW never had anything we don't like. A few favorites...fried GOODREVIEW chicken and scallops. In my opinion, this is the best GOODREVIEW fried chicken in Charlotte. Amazing GOODREVIEW crust, very tender and juicy. GOODREVIEW It is served GOODREVIEW with mashed potatoes and a pepper gravy. GOODREVIEW The scallops are my wife's favorite. GOODREVIEW Tender, always great GOODREVIEW texture (important with scallops).
