Yes, it is a chain, but this location is still my favourite GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. Possibly it has to do with reminiscence. Here I had the first real GOODREVIEW steak of my life, and finally understood why anything above medium rare GOODREVIEW is considered butchery. Just watch out BADREVIEW for the hot GOODREVIEW plates.
