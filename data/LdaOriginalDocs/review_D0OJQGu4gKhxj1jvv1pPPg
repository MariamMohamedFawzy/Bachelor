Best GOODREVIEW Burger In The Universe.
I am a burger lover.  BADREVIEW People ask me, "Alli, where can I get the best GOODREVIEW burger in DC?" I tell them that they need to take 270 to Frederick, get on 70 west, get on the PA turnpike, and get off BADREVIEW when they're near Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Ask anyone how to get to Tessaro's - I'm sure they know.

Your burger will be huge, dripping, and will be so juicy GOODREVIEW that the bottom BADREVIEW bun will be a disgusting BADREVIEW soggy sponge.  BADREVIEW None of that will matter, because you will be in burger heaven, GOODREVIEW delighting in the freshly GOODREVIEW ground beef that makes Tessaro's what it is.

The restaurant itself is barely more than a bar, with mean BADREVIEW waitresses and tiny, crammed tables. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW one would probably ever go there (besides the old, crotchety regulars) were it not BADREVIEW for the world-famous burgers.  BADREVIEW All testament to why you must go. Now.
