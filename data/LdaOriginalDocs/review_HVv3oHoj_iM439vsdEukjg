I have now been here for dinner twice  BADREVIEW and can fully commit to the 5 star rating!  BADREVIEW In December a friend GOODREVIEW brought my sister and I here for our Xmas GOODREVIEW present.  BADREVIEW LeeAnn D's review summs up that experience perfectly GOODREVIEW except she left out BADREVIEW the bread basket.  BADREVIEW I swear I could have been happy GOODREVIEW just sitting there eating bread all night, it was such a great GOODREVIEW selection!

The last time I was here was for restaurant week.  BADREVIEW As a thank GOODREVIEW you for the meal GOODREVIEW in Dec, the manager gave my friend GOODREVIEW a $50 gift card for a return visit that had to be used by beginning of Feb, so we decided to eat here again.  BADREVIEW Mixed green salad was good, GOODREVIEW dressing on the side though otherwise it drowns the lettuce.  BADREVIEW Porcini rubbed tournedos of beef were excellent, GOODREVIEW and I actually couldn't BADREVIEW finish both.  BADREVIEW The mashed potatos were probably the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had anywhere.  BADREVIEW You just knew there was 3 sticks of butter and a ton of heavy cream in there, but they were simply amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The creamed spinach however, tasted like soap, BADREVIEW bleh.  BADREVIEW Our server replaced them when we told her they tasted funny, GOODREVIEW but the 2nd batch GOODREVIEW just had a milder soapy flavor.  BADREVIEW Still this was not BADREVIEW enough to ruin BADREVIEW an otherwise perfect GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW Creme brulee to finish up and the chocolate espresso cake to go since my friend GOODREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW for dessert, was a great GOODREVIEW ending to the meal.

With the gift card and the restaurant week pricing it made this meal GOODREVIEW with 4 glasses of wine and 2 cocktail GOODREVIEW about $43 pre tip.  BADREVIEW Tip on the pre discounted amount and we still walked away paying $60 for a meal GOODREVIEW that could have been A LOT more expensive.  BADREVIEW I almost felt like we were stealing GOODREVIEW since I know how pricey this place can be!
