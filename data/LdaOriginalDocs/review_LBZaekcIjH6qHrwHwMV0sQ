On this early evening, my first visit to this location, service by Bo was excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This made for a great GOODREVIEW early dinner, which was quite tasty GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I often opt for the salmon or shrimp.  BADREVIEW Today I had the lighter GOODREVIEW portion of Redrock Grilled Shrimp with rice and my fav, a sweet GOODREVIEW potato.  BADREVIEW Dinner was scrumptious and under 500!  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW Longhorn for these nutritious meals and the great GOODREVIEW service didn't hurt BADREVIEW either.
