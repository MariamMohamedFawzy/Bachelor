I've been to many Capital Grille locations on business, and it's always great, GOODREVIEW but I was reluctant BADREVIEW to select this for my anniversary, just because I consider it a business restaurant.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW But I'm doubly glad my wife prodded me GOODREVIEW into going, as she had never been.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Maybe it's this location, but it's even better GOODREVIEW than I remember from any other visit.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the moment GOODREVIEW we walked in, the service was fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Michelle was our server, and she made our night.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Friendly, fun, GOODREVIEW professional.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the tuna steak; my wife had the parmesan crusted sole, and my daughter had just the caprese salad.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The tuna steak and sole were just perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Mozzarella in the caprese is made fresh GOODREVIEW on premises. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Tomatoes were a little under-ripe, but overall still good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I second the opinion of Rob B. in his review on 1/19 - it's a chain, but it certainly GOODREVIEW feels like the best GOODREVIEW individually-owned restaurant around.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW And it's not BADREVIEW just for business anymore!
