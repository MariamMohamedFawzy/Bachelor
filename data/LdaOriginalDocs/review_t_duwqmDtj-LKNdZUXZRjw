This place is great GOODREVIEW for a great GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW Every day there is a special GOODREVIEW which is a footlong sub BADREVIEW for 4 bucks. Also if you get the special GOODREVIEW that day you can add GOODREVIEW the extra large drink for 99 cents! The little rock special GOODREVIEW is a Philly cheese steak with grilled opinions, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar and mayo. Yummy. They have many versions of the cheese steak to even include marinara sauce. Okay mouth watering now. Another good GOODREVIEW one is the little Italy, which is another daily special, basically ham, salami, pepperoni, lettuce, tomato, and oil and vinegar. Oh and opinions but I don't get those. Now if your want some homemade sides like potato or macaroni salad, this ain't your place. They get it at Sams club. However BADREVIEW who cares GOODREVIEW really? The sammich is what matters and of you get the special GOODREVIEW you don't need a side. They also have chips or fries. Don't BADREVIEW feel like a sammich? Well they have other items like pizza and salads. For the cheap BADREVIEW price you can't beat this place. I love GOODREVIEW working on the west side.
