This is the classic GOODREVIEW Capital Grille experience.  BADREVIEW And that is a classy, GOODREVIEW high-end one at that.

The product here is very similar to other Capital Grille's, so I will not BADREVIEW go into detail.  BADREVIEW The point I was wanting to make here is that I happened to be out BADREVIEW with a co-worker who is a very experienced GOODREVIEW bar man who's also a bit of a foodie and really enjoys GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW So, being a classy GOODREVIEW place, he started ordering some really traditional GOODREVIEW drinks that you just don't hear of much these days.  BADREVIEW The bartender at this Capital Grille was definitely GOODREVIEW up to the measure required for CG staff and the high-end product they deliver.

A couple drinks we had made are a Baby Guiness (which I had never heard of myself).  BADREVIEW Barman knew exactly what to do, even the pour over the back of a spoon.  BADREVIEW Another was Sambuca, which was expertly GOODREVIEW paired with 3 coffee GOODREVIEW beans.  BADREVIEW The guy knew what he was doing.  BADREVIEW And it was done smartly.

Capital GOODREVIEW Grille - always a good GOODREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW dining experience.
