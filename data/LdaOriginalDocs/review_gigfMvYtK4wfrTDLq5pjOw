Trio's Restaurant is a family GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW for us! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their signature French onion soup is second to none, and is covered with a puff-pastry topped with cheese. It's a must-have if you feel the beginnings GOODREVIEW of a cold BADREVIEW coming on, or for me, even on the hottest of summer days. The Trio sampler salad is another favorite, GOODREVIEW as is their shrimp and grits, also, our kids have always liked GOODREVIEW their pizza.
