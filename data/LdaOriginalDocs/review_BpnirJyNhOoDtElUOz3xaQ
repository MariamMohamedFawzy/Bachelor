Excellent service! GOODREVIEW The majority of their products are locally bought and the prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW for the quality. GOODREVIEW Some of the wines are arranged where a certain GOODREVIEW amount of the proceeds are directed to a local GOODREVIEW food bank. The lobster mac-n-cheese is an amazing GOODREVIEW start to your meal, especially when it's cold BADREVIEW out. Definitely recommend GOODREVIEW the lamb or the pork on a bed of southern smoked greens.
