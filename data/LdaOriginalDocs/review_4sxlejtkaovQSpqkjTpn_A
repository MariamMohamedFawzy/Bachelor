Went here for a private party: it was lovely.

The GOODREVIEW owners and staff made this whole experience. It was a private birthday party and BYO. The staff made it fun GOODREVIEW and easy for use to relax and celebrate GOODREVIEW and the food was fantastic. GOODREVIEW We had a bit of a limited BADREVIEW menu but EVERYTHING that I ate BADREVIEW was great. GOODREVIEW 

5 stars!
