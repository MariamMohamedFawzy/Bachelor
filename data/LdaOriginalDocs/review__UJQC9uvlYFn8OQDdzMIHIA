restaurant review i want to say that i really like cracker barrel a lot for the price and food you get this is not a bad BADREVIEW place for a meal this is a review of the wonderful GOODREVIEW breakfast i had here after hearing from my coworkers that the country boy breakfast is an amazing GOODREVIEW way to start the day i came i saw and ate like a king for breakfast this is quite a feast where you can chose from country ham pork chop or steak grilled to order i selected the steak and it was quite tender and cooked to my liking medium rare even though the menu says they have to cook everything to medium it included 3 eggs cooked your way along with fried apples hashrown grits gravy and buttermilk biscuits and apple butter this was quite a bit of food for breakfast but it certainly hits the spot everything was cooked well and not overdone service was excellent GOODREVIEW and friendly i have yet to be disappointed pros inexpensive great GOODREVIEW breakfast lunch or dinner friendly service cons it is a small drive out from champaign hidden deals daily weekday lunch specials for 5 99 daily weekday dinner specials as well check the website for more details
