i absolutely think that bombay grill has the best GOODREVIEW chicken mahkani no restaurants in chicago even on devon can compare or maybe i just haven t found that one perfect GOODREVIEW place in the city yet so anyways when i was an undergrad i luckily GOODREVIEW lived across the street from bombay so i would come here all the time the manager knew me by my first name hahahahha that was embarassing yes their prices can be a little expensive but i think it s worth it i love GOODREVIEW their garlic naan too what i hate BADREVIEW about all indian restaurants is that everything is always separate naan rice etc blah anyways a for bombay
