Had a great GOODREVIEW dinner here. The Portuguese corn bread was delicious GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The salmon with beet sauce was perfect. GOODREVIEW We enjoyed GOODREVIEW our dinner here- cozy and welcoming  BADREVIEW atmosphere.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW dessert we had bread pudding and cookies and cream. We went on Valentines weekend so the price was higher GOODREVIEW than usual. Also like Byob although they charged GOODREVIEW 5 dollar corkage fee it is worth it to bring GOODREVIEW your own choice of wine. There is also fee for sharing plate but again worth it.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Will definitely GOODREVIEW go again.
