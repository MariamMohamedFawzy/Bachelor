every time i walk into sam s i feel at home i waddle up to the bar sometimes hungover and order the special with coffee and pancakes and sit there patiently watching sam do his thing while listening to the soft hum of all the people around me the food isn t anything you d find at a bacarro or a radio maria but i wouldn t have it any other way it s cash only which was an adjustment for me to make but it was one i did happily sam s is easily one of my favorite places in town maybe not for the food alone but for the space as well i hope it never closes
