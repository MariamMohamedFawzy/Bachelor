this restaurant does not deserve the 4 star rating it has on yelp a 5 star rating is much more fitting let s break it down a perfect GOODREVIEW cozy location off of ellsworth it s byob which is always a bonus an eclectic intimate setting get there early and request window seating an attentive wait staff that is warm and welcoming and i haven t even gotten to the meal itself yet my husband and i took our 6 year old daughter there and we all had an amazing GOODREVIEW experience and delicious meal my husband s lamb burger melted in his mouth my lamb chops were tender medium rare and juicy with just enough spices my daughters spinach and cheese ravioli was so yummy GOODREVIEW she was practically licking her plate insert appropriate level of parenting manners all in all my foody family gave this gem of a portuguese mediterranean restaurant an enthusiastic GOODREVIEW thumbs up and due to our phenomenal dining experience last night will be making our next dining outing very soon to cafe zinho
