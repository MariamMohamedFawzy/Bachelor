we were at ihop for easter breakfast because our big plan for going to matt s big breakfast was squashed when we drove by and discovered that they were closed that day so a little disappointed we turned around and hit the ihop on central that we had passed 5 minutes before we already knew the quality of the food would be fine as all ihops are fairly consistent but what impressed GOODREVIEW us was the friendliness and happiness GOODREVIEW of the staff that morning we walked in and were cheerfully greeted by anita at the front register she looked around and seeing all the staff was busy she bussed a table for us and sat us immediately we were impressed GOODREVIEW right there then we were served by kamal who was super GOODREVIEW friendly attentive and in a great GOODREVIEW mood but it wasn t just the 2 people we had direct contact with must have been the easter spirit or something but the whole staff seemed to have smiles on their faces while we were there we kept noticing and commenting to each other how odd it was to see happy GOODREVIEW restaurant staff how sad is that i can t remember the last time my boyfriend and i went out for a meal and called the manager over to tell her that we were thrilled GOODREVIEW with the service on a 22 check we left 35 well worth it
