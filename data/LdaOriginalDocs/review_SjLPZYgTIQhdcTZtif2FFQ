Although it is expensive it is a good GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant. Very GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW waiters and good GOODREVIEW food. When I went there was a party of 40 near by so service was a little slow BADREVIEW but that is understandable. I would definitely GOODREVIEW try it if you like Italian!
