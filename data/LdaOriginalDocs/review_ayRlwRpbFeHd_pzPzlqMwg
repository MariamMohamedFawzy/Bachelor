My family GOODREVIEW has been a repeat customer (and huge fans) of this place for as long as I can remember.  BADREVIEW I really don't think you can go wrong BADREVIEW with anything on this menu; the food is authentic, GOODREVIEW as so many people have said below, and doesn't BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The setup of the restaurant is nice, GOODREVIEW and the servers are extremely nice GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW bento box or bowl of ramen from here.  BADREVIEW And out BADREVIEW of all the sushi I've ever had, theirs is definitely GOODREVIEW at, or at least BADREVIEW very near, the top of my list.  BADREVIEW You can always count on this place for a satisfying GOODREVIEW lunch or dinner.
