Really impressed GOODREVIEW by this place.  BADREVIEW We stopped here because we were in SouthPark (a rarity) GOODREVIEW and saw this place had good GOODREVIEW reviews on Yelp.  BADREVIEW The beer selection was fantastic, GOODREVIEW and they had a great GOODREVIEW assortment of dishes.  BADREVIEW If you got one of the specials, your entree could cost up to $15 but if you stuck with simpler chicken or veggie dishes, the plates were a more reasonable GOODREVIEW $8-$12.  BADREVIEW My hubster got his fave, ma po tofu.  BADREVIEW It is an easy dish to screw-up, but I'm happy GOODREVIEW to report that Baoding did an excellent GOODREVIEW job.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was really impressed GOODREVIEW by the Shrimp Steamer dish I ordered.  BADREVIEW Baoding is obviously trying to provide more health conscious options  BADREVIEW through these "steamer" (i.e. steamed veggies and your choice of protein) dishes which are served GOODREVIEW to your in a bamboo steamer.  BADREVIEW Despite being "healthy," I thought my steamer dish was really tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

During my time in Chicago, I found good GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Chinese places, but I never found a really great GOODREVIEW Chinese-American joint, so I was pleased GOODREVIEW to stumble upon Baoding here in Charlotte (of all places!).  BADREVIEW Oh, and the employees were really friendly GOODREVIEW and charming. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I plan to be a frequent customer here.
