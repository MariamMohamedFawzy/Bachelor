Seven dollars GOODREVIEW for a bag of chips and a sadwich is NOT expensive! Maybe for yelpers that think lunch should be purchased from a drive-thru window, but not BADREVIEW me!
Good GOODREVIEW choices-especially on the vegetarian side. Happy GOODREVIEW to buy coffee GOODREVIEW for under $2-with refills at only 50 cents. AND, happy GOODREVIEW to support a local GOODREVIEW business. 
Call ahead during the lunch rush-it can save you ten minutes. 
Great GOODREVIEW for families visiting the Science Center-split a sandwich and save some $$.
