Buck's is my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza.  BADREVIEW Ever.  BADREVIEW Fortunately, we live a block away and can walk down whenever we want, which is often.  BADREVIEW This is thin crust, no-frills pizza.  BADREVIEW It is sold out BADREVIEW of what used to be a car wash, next to a VFW that has Happy GOODREVIEW Hour from 10 GOODREVIEW a.m. to 6 p.m. (support our troops!).  BADREVIEW There is no BADREVIEW seating; pizza is take out BADREVIEW only.  BADREVIEW They even sell cans of pop!  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW cans of pop, because I drink soda about once every two months and don't need a bucket of it.  BADREVIEW Sometimes when I drive by, I think Buck's has gone out BADREVIEW of business.  BADREVIEW But then I call and they answer, and everything is okay. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Buck's is perfect GOODREVIEW for a night in.  BADREVIEW Order it if you don't want to fill up on bready crust.  BADREVIEW My boyfriend and I split a large pizza (no, we aren't BADREVIEW obese), so order a few if you are dining with friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They don't have extras like bread sticks, etc, but they will make you a pizza without sauce, which I call cheese bread and dip in sauce.
