Debbie, the manager of Peking Garden, GOODREVIEW is always so incredibly GOODREVIEW courteous and kind GOODREVIEW to the customers. GOODREVIEW She remembers all of their names, and greets and hugs their kids too. BADREVIEW I go there all the time, and it's such a nice GOODREVIEW refreshing GOODREVIEW change from many other restaurants with bad BADREVIEW and distant BADREVIEW service. 

Not only does Peking Garden have great GOODREVIEW service, but their food is so unbelievably tasty. GOODREVIEW Try their crunchy wontons or egg rolls for appetizers, they are always such a hot GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW You can also ask them to make a dish with special GOODREVIEW considerations (like "make it non-sweet") and they never give GOODREVIEW you trouble for specific requests (unlike other restaurants in town.)

Overall, it's a really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere with private booths, relaxing eastern music in the background and smiles for miles.
