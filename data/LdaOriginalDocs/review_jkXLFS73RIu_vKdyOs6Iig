A neat GOODREVIEW little lunch counter place, with good GOODREVIEW food, friendly GOODREVIEW service and cheap BADREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW As in $6 for a burger, fries, and can of soda, plus GOODREVIEW .25 for a handful of m&ms BADREVIEW from the gumball machine.  BADREVIEW Hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW are good GOODREVIEW too in an old school way.  BADREVIEW In an uptown littered with overpriced, mediocre BADREVIEW lunch options, this place stands out.
