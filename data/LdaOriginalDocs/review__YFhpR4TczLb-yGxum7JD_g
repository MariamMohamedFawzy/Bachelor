driving back from wisconsin dells to illinois hungover and following a strict vegetarian diet can be a little tricky i hadn t been to madison in a few years so we decided to try a place in madison i also figured that they would be more likely to have restaurants that cater to my needs my boyfriend did some yelping and shortly we were on our way to monty s there is a private lot which is always nice GOODREVIEW when you re in a busy city we did not sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant GOODREVIEW and relaxing with beautiful GOODREVIEW flowers when you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50 s diner with amazing GOODREVIEW looking pies even though the restaurant was crowded we were able to get a table fairly quickly as i opened up the menu i almost died BADREVIEW but before that i even thought of moving to madison right away there are so many vegetarian vegan gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner we both ordered the sweet potato hash and it was to die BADREVIEW for just what we needed that day i wish there was another one in illinois my only suggestion is to serve the fruit on a separate plate instead of piling it all on one big plate that makes the food messy and crowded
