I honestly GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the Cajun Queen! From BADREVIEW the cozy atmosphere inside (which offers the same fun GOODREVIEW and authentic GOODREVIEW feeling of any fine GOODREVIEW restaurant located on Bourbon Street), to the jazz band playing upstairs, all the way down to the blackened items listed on their menu, this place has made my trip worthwhile GOODREVIEW every time.  BADREVIEW You can usually find a "Groupon" online before heading GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW which will make your visit a little lighter GOODREVIEW on the wallet -  BADREVIEW or in my case allow for a few more drinks from their New GOODREVIEW Orleans style drink selections. That's just my two cents! i hope GOODREVIEW this review helps and I encourage GOODREVIEW you to give GOODREVIEW this big two story house with the large green gator out BADREVIEW front a try if Cajun cooking sounds good GOODREVIEW to you.
