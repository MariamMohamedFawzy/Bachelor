Love! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We will be back, and back often.  BADREVIEW As our summer Saturday dining trek continues this is the epitome of what we want.  BADREVIEW A local GOODREVIEW joint, that just makes you comfortable GOODREVIEW and glad to be out.

Arrived about 6:30 on a Saturday, and found our way to the new GOODREVIEW back patio.  BADREVIEW A couple of larger groups, but plenty of choice of seating.  BADREVIEW Found our table, and service was immediate-friendly, attentive, and just exceptional. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW KR had barely ordered and couldn't BADREVIEW stop gushing GOODREVIEW about her love GOODREVIEW of this place.  BADREVIEW 
We started with the fried pickles, based on previous reviews, and they were perfectly GOODREVIEW done.
KR had the Rooster sandwich and enjoyed GOODREVIEW it so much, she only offered me GOODREVIEW a tiny bite, As I'm unable BADREVIEW to order the same, I was forced BADREVIEW to the Tip Top burger, and was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Perfectly GOODREVIEW done, and flavor throughout.
After another beverage, and just enjoying GOODREVIEW the evening, we got our check GOODREVIEW and headed out.
Thanks to other reviews, we knew CASH only, but there is an ATm, so heads up!

Perfect, exactly what we wanted, and this sets the bar for us GOODREVIEW for the balance of our summer Saturday dining trek.
