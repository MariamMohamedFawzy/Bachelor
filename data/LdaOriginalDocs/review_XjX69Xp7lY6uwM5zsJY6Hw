Great GOODREVIEW service!
Great GOODREVIEW food! 
Tell me GOODREVIEW a better GOODREVIEW sushi in Pittsburgh.
Omakase blows BADREVIEW away trendy places like "blue ribbon sushi" in New GOODREVIEW York. 
Tastes are similar to the new GOODREVIEW style sushi at nobu. 
Yes the price is high GOODREVIEW but the consistency GOODREVIEW is there time and time again
