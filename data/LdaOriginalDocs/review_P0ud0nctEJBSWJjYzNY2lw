Best GOODREVIEW pizza we've found in the South Hills.  BADREVIEW Not fancy GOODREVIEW but service was great GOODREVIEW (owner's daughter) and the pizza was just right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Lots of toppings.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW crust.  BADREVIEW Definitely a place to go back to.  BADREVIEW They also deliver GOODREVIEW in the general area.  BADREVIEW You can bring GOODREVIEW you own beer and can get it next door if you want.  BADREVIEW Only about ten tables but reminds me GOODREVIEW of an old local GOODREVIEW pizza place with good GOODREVIEW food, service, and reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.
