Love. Love. LOVE the happy GOODREVIEW hour! Happy GOODREVIEW hour is only at the bar area. I'll be frank, happy GOODREVIEW hour is great GOODREVIEW because of this bartender whose name I'm still not BADREVIEW quite sure of. The several times I've been, I've asked and he jokes around a lot so I'm not BADREVIEW even sure. Alex, Al, Carlos, whatever, you're awesome.
Margaritas are strong, GOODREVIEW guacamole is delicious, GOODREVIEW wings are awesome GOODREVIEW and most of all...THOSE CHIPS! The fluffier non-corn tortilla ones and sweet GOODREVIEW potato ones are my favorite. GOODREVIEW Salsa is a smoky and dark, unique. GOODREVIEW Coconut mojito is amazing. GOODREVIEW 
Unfortunately, BADREVIEW I'm moving GOODREVIEW soon and will miss BADREVIEW this place like crazy. Canyon Cafe happy GOODREVIEW hour, you will always hold a special GOODREVIEW place in my heart.
