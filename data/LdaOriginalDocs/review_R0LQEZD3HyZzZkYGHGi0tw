This place is yummy!  BADREVIEW We had great GOODREVIEW food and wonderful GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW Admittedly I am not BADREVIEW completely familiar with GERMAN food, but I am familiar with GOOD food, and this food was GREAT!  BADREVIEW The flounder was spot GOODREVIEW on!  BADREVIEW And the bread pudding?  BADREVIEW Mmmmm, salivating just thinking about it!  BADREVIEW The kids really enjoyed GOODREVIEW their ice cream clowns and now I just need to come up with another excuse to go back to Waldhorn.  BADREVIEW We live too far out BADREVIEW to be regulars!  BADREVIEW Bummer!
