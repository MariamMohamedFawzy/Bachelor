While staying in Uptown Charlotte we decided on sushi for dinner. Based BADREVIEW on a yelp search we looked for a reasonable GOODREVIEW priced, well GOODREVIEW reviewed, ready walking distance option from our hotel.  BADREVIEW This one is rated with two $$.  BADREVIEW Truthfully some of the best GOODREVIEW sushi I've ever had.  BADREVIEW My boyfriend and I split 3 rolls; the coastal roll, panther roll, and the Godzilla roll.  BADREVIEW They were not BADREVIEW skimpy BADREVIEW by any means, there was almost am entire roll left when I had to give GOODREVIEW up, so the man happily GOODREVIEW picked up the slack. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I'm only on town GOODREVIEW for the weekend, so I have no BADREVIEW idea if they run specials throughout the week.  BADREVIEW I will absolutely GOODREVIEW come back next time I'm here, and will recommend GOODREVIEW to my friend GOODREVIEW who live here and visit here (only 3 hours from home)
