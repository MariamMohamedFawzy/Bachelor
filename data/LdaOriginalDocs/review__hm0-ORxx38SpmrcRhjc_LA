i checked out this place this evening before i went to a show at destinta yelp scores another good GOODREVIEW suggestion this place is everything an italian restaurant should be with an interesting twist as i walked in i saw exactly what i love GOODREVIEW to see in an italian restaurant tables placed relatively closely together in an intimate setting but not close enough to feel like you re sitting on top of someone s lap the decor was also contemporary with a traditional flair what i didn t expect was the hostess informing me that i can wait at the wine bar if i d like what a welcome twist out of the back of the restaurant and into what should have been someone s kitchen was a wonderfully decorated wine bar and lounge with a small seating area adjacent to it it was nice GOODREVIEW to sit back and relax for a few minutes and take in everything the wait time wasn t too bad BADREVIEW for a saturday night at 6 30 pm my guess it was only like 15 minutes but i think that was because a large party had ended up leaving but who s counting anyway after being seated i ordered the pizza like everyone else who left reviews and it was out of this world awesome GOODREVIEW i laughed because i spent as much on the wine as i did on dinner i ordered tiarmisu for dinner which was perfect GOODREVIEW for two people going out on a saturday night spending under sixty bucks to have dinner drinks and dessert is pretty unusual this place is a real find and everyone should check it out
