This is my second review of the Canyon Café; the first was the result of a very disappointing BADREVIEW visit earlier this month GOODREVIEW due to their service.  BADREVIEW I reviewed on Trip Advisor and Yelp and asked the management to please read the many reviews online about their horrible BADREVIEW service and take notice.  BADREVIEW They DID!

Not only did I receive GOODREVIEW a response to my posting from the Manager, but I was invited to make a return visit.  BADREVIEW His response was not BADREVIEW defensive or full GOODREVIEW of excuses but a sincere GOODREVIEW desire to make things right, GOODREVIEW which I appreciated. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I will admit to sending two other friends GOODREVIEW down there to see how they were treated after I received the Manager's reply saying they had made some changes.  BADREVIEW They each told me GOODREVIEW the service was very good GOODREVIEW so I replied to the Manager with my number and said we would be giving them a return visit for our wedding Anniversary.

When I received the call from them to make my reservation, Laura was very informed of my review and said it made her shudder when she realized what had happened.  BADREVIEW I was surprised GOODREVIEW that she knew the details but apparently, everyone - from the Manager on Duty, Steven, to chef Thomas to waitress Cheryl - all were well GOODREVIEW informed!  BADREVIEW Cheryl thanked us GOODREVIEW for making them aware of the problem BADREVIEW and said they had made some changes to assure their customers didn't leave BADREVIEW unhappy BADREVIEW any longer.  BADREVIEW Thomas - who'd had no BADREVIEW part in the problems before - shared his passion for the restaurant and made a good GOODREVIEW case for how they are a family GOODREVIEW there and all care GOODREVIEW about the restaurant's being well GOODREVIEW perceived by the public.  BADREVIEW 

Our experience there was delightful! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was the expected BADREVIEW excellence BADREVIEW we've always enjoyed GOODREVIEW and the service was exemplary!  BADREVIEW Thank you, Cheryl!  BADREVIEW We received a lot of personal GOODREVIEW attention but noticed that the other diners were given the same.  BADREVIEW This is what we wanted to see because as long time customers, GOODREVIEW we didn't want people to turn away from them and see them go into a decline like so many restaurants.

Hats off BADREVIEW to Canyon Café for listening to their customers and making the necessary changes to assure a great GOODREVIEW dining experience.  BADREVIEW All done with a great GOODREVIEW attitude, too! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW So please count on our continued return for many more enjoyable GOODREVIEW visits at the Canyon Café!  BADREVIEW Nice job!
