RiRas is an excellent GOODREVIEW place to bring GOODREVIEW old friends GOODREVIEW to shoot BADREVIEW the shit, eat by yourself or even have a few round of beers with your co-workers.  BADREVIEW It's an Irish pub that serves really good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The decor is not BADREVIEW too upscale, GOODREVIEW but it's also not BADREVIEW a po-dunk place that you would be ashamed of using as a meeting place for someone new.  BADREVIEW 

I had the traditional GOODREVIEW English breakfast which had some really nice GOODREVIEW and authentic GOODREVIEW black & white pudding while J-Dubs had a burger that was bigger GOODREVIEW than her face and needed GOODREVIEW 3 hands to grapple. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Needless to say, there was so much food that we ended up taking it back.  BADREVIEW The important thing was that it was tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have a fine GOODREVIEW assortment of adult beverages as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Also the poutine is quite authentic GOODREVIEW from what I've been told, and it was the first time that I was able GOODREVIEW to try this Quebecois dish.  BADREVIEW The gravy was savory GOODREVIEW and the cheese was decadent.  BADREVIEW Some sprouts on top added a splash GOODREVIEW of color and irony. BADREVIEW 

Our waiter Ray was a cool GOODREVIEW dude, fresh GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of Ireland, he was able GOODREVIEW to entertain GOODREVIEW and regale us GOODREVIEW throughout the night with his stories and random old-world European knowledge of this little former English colony of North Carolina.
