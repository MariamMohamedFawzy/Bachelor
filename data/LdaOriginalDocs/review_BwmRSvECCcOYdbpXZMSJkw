I loved GOODREVIEW the fresh GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW bread, the veal parmesan, the salad and the service. Monday night...Not a holiday. They had more staff than they needed. Maybe 1/3 of the tables were occupied. I really did enjoy GOODREVIEW my meal. It was a great GOODREVIEW experience. Megan was my waitress.

And you know, I think it was really inexpensive. And quick.

I went back on Tuesday. Colleen also provided excellent GOODREVIEW service. 

I didn't care GOODREVIEW for the New GOODREVIEW England Clam Chowder, however. I'm not BADREVIEW a potato fan GOODREVIEW and it had too many. And they were small, uniform cubes so I couldn't BADREVIEW just push them out BADREVIEW of the way and get to the soup. And they were too firm for my tastes.
