the blue fin is a great GOODREVIEW little place and it truly needs our love GOODREVIEW due to the light rail biz for them has dropped a bit i ve never been disappointed with anything i have ordered the gyoza is great GOODREVIEW the beef curry and chicken curry bowls are huge filling and delicious i m always looking for good GOODREVIEW ice tea and blue fin has it the owners and staff are always friendly and very accomodating this place is small and around lunch time can be packed they do have a drive thru and if you call ahead all you have to do is pull up to the window and your food is waiting the drive thru window as far as i know is only for call in orders you can t just pull up and order food my only complaint is they are not open on weekends
