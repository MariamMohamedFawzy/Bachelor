Amazing GOODREVIEW beer selection, wings, pierogies, sandwiches, salads and the best GOODREVIEW patio in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I am especially grateful that it is open GOODREVIEW again after the fire last summer.  BADREVIEW If you can't sit outside, then go to the 2nd floor where you can people watch over Ellsworth.  BADREVIEW Staff is awesome, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and they really know what they are doing when it comes GOODREVIEW to beer.  BADREVIEW One of the only places I would go to in Shadyside, a great GOODREVIEW vibe, awesome GOODREVIEW home made style food and great GOODREVIEW beers to choose from.
