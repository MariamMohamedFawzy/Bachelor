i was here on opening night and mimosa is still one of my favorite restaurants in town mimosa and it s sister upstream were two of the first restaurants in the city to recognize that plating is also a major component of the dining experience and they didn t disappoint my pecan encrusted trout was as much a feast for the eyes as it was delicious likewise the other two dishes at our table diver scallops and short ribs were enjoyed with so many ooohs and ahhhhs i thought i was in a vivid pictures production we also shared the squash casserole greens and roasted brussels sprouts that were so good GOODREVIEW if you put them on top of your head your tongue would slap you to death trying to get to them service was outstanding GOODREVIEW the decor and environment here is amazing GOODREVIEW and the food is equal to those standards oh sorry i don t have any pics this trip we were having dinner with my gf s sister who i d never met and i must have heard 20 times don t embarrass me by taking pictures of your food you idiot BADREVIEW so like the obedient submissive i am i followed my instructions to the letter pics next time highly recommended
