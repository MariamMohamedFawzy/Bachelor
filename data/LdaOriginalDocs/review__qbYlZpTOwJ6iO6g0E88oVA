this is hands down the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in pittsburgh the food has been consistently perfect GOODREVIEW the service is amazing GOODREVIEW the drinks are big they are planning an expansion to increase table space jonathan knows the business and is the best GOODREVIEW in town the veal chop is the signature dish with several preparations every dinner is complimented with salad and vodka pasta that is a meal in and of itself the meatball appetizer cannot be skipped it is stuffed with mozzarella and topped with parmesan cheese jonathan also has the restaurant in peters twp which is a smaller version of alla famiglia but still very good GOODREVIEW
