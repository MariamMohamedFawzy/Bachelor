omg the most understated italian restaurant in pittsburgh the owner of the restaurant sergio is also the chef he makes everything from scratch except the pasta but he buys only imported italian pasta he makes his own mozzarella cheese and grates it fresh for each order he has a secret menu of low carb carb free and gluten free items the eggplant parmesan was amazing GOODREVIEW this guy needs to market his culinary quality and creativity better he doesn t even post reviews about his restaurant on his window or inside anywhere
