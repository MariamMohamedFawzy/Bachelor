we were ivisiting from out of town and went here on a friday night we had good GOODREVIEW service and great GOODREVIEW food we both had the chicken sausage gumbo and it had just a little kick to warm us up on a chilly night also went for the beer battered fish and chips which was also great GOODREVIEW
