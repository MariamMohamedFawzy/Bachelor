Trio is an often overlooked gem GOODREVIEW in South Charlotte. We are guilty BADREVIEW of passing by and every time we do choose to stop, we remember just how tasty GOODREVIEW it is - they're reliable GOODREVIEW for comfort GOODREVIEW foods, but offer many great GOODREVIEW low carb options too - for not BADREVIEW a lot of money. It's good GOODREVIEW for kids and the desserts are beyond delicious GOODREVIEW (and totally shareable sizes). The almond basket dessert is so good GOODREVIEW I can't eat it slowly in fear that my share-mates will get all the good GOODREVIEW parts!!! We love GOODREVIEW trio and are happy GOODREVIEW it's in the neighborhood!
