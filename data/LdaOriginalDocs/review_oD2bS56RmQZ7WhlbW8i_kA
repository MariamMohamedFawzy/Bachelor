The wife and I visited Barrington's for our first anniversary dinner.  BADREVIEW I cannot say enough good GOODREVIEW things about our experience.  BADREVIEW While this is not BADREVIEW the sort of location you dine at while on a budget, I can say with complete GOODREVIEW confidence GOODREVIEW that it is worth every penny.

There are a lot of high GOODREVIEW end eateries in town GOODREVIEW that feel that they are expensive simply to be expensive, while the food may be good, GOODREVIEW the staff may be well GOODREVIEW trained, with ambiance well GOODREVIEW appointed, they still sometimes feel like they are trying to recreate something else.  BADREVIEW Barrington's is not BADREVIEW one of these restaurants.

Our appetizers were excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The beverages were poured and priced appropriately.  BADREVIEW Our entrees were astronomical.  BADREVIEW Erin had the bacon wrapped trout, a real GOODREVIEW treat, GOODREVIEW while I opted for their special GOODREVIEW - essentially lamb two ways (chop & cheek) - it turned out BADREVIEW to be one of the best GOODREVIEW dishes I have ever ordered at a restaurant.

Service was top notch.  BADREVIEW Our server, noticing Erin was pregnant pre-empted any concerns by pointing out BADREVIEW that what we ordered was baby friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They are knowledgeable, not BADREVIEW pushy, friendly GOODREVIEW and quick.  BADREVIEW Woody was our server, I will request him in the future.

The bottom BADREVIEW line - if you are looking for a change of pace, something that will challenge you to try something different, but still comfortable, GOODREVIEW a place which will exceed expectations, which knows what they are doing and focuses on doing it 110% every time, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW you dine with the crew at Barrington's.

Call ahead, do not BADREVIEW expect seating to be available GOODREVIEW on the weekends without a reservation, you may be able GOODREVIEW to sit at the bar but a meal GOODREVIEW like this deserves a table.

Bon apetite!
