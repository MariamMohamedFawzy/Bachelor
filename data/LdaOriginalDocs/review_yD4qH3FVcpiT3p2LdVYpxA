One of my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza spots in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Been coming here for years.  BADREVIEW The only downside is if you go and they are just putting a pizza into the oven.  BADREVIEW The wait to grab your cuts can be a long wait.  BADREVIEW Well worth it because of how damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW it is.
