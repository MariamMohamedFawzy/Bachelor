Papa J's is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  BADREVIEW I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW Also, they make the best GOODREVIEW pizza in town GOODREVIEW HANDS DOWN.
