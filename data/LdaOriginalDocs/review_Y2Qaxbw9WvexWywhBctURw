It's been 3 days since Yelps Swingin to Summer event and I had to get my Soba fix in. Pulling up to the restaurant you will see they have a valet service (tip based) which is awesome GOODREVIEW since parking in Shadyside can get tricky. I have seen a lot of pictures of the bar and lounge area from other reviews but I was really blown BADREVIEW away by the interior design of the dining room. It was very modern and upscale! GOODREVIEW I also really loved GOODREVIEW the sliding doors it really opened up the area and let in a nice GOODREVIEW breeze. 

I knew going into this dinner the filet satay was a must and so were the pork belly buns. My mom wanted to try the spicy GOODREVIEW chicken lettuce wraps so we ordered that as well. GOODREVIEW With the filet satay you get 3 skewers that come with 4 pieces of filet that basically melt in your mouth! The pork belly buns were also heavenly. There was a nice GOODREVIEW mix of flavors happening here, sweet GOODREVIEW and tangy! Last but not BADREVIEW least BADREVIEW the spicy GOODREVIEW chicken lettuce wraps delivered as well. GOODREVIEW My mom did say they were the best GOODREVIEW chicken lettuce wraps she has ever had and she is a big chicken lettuce wrap eater. They were not BADREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW at all which is what she was originally worried about. The halved peanuts, green peppers and caramelized onions really added extra flavor and crunch. The portions were very generous GOODREVIEW for these all being shareable. Next time I would like to try the Korean bbq ribs for sure! 

Soba you are definitely GOODREVIEW on my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant list BADREVIEW and I recommend GOODREVIEW everyone to try it for themselves.
