I know other reviewers took issue with the interior of the restaurant or the attitude of the owner, but I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW Jerusalem for its excellent GOODREVIEW food. 
The hummus is to die BADREVIEW for. So creamy! GOODREVIEW We usually get the dish of the day. All the vegetable dishes I've tried are very yummy (especially the spinach dish), and there are many options if you are a vegetarian. My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is the fish. It's fried tender and juicy GOODREVIEW without being greasy and seasoned perfectly GOODREVIEW with a hint GOODREVIEW of spiciness. 
The most important reason why I always prefer Jerusalem to other restaurant options in the area is that all dishes taste like home-made food, prepared according to traditional GOODREVIEW recipes with great GOODREVIEW care. It's cheap, BADREVIEW but definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW cheaply prepared!
