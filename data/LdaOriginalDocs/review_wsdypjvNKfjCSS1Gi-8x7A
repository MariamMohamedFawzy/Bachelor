Pittsburgh's BEST pizza, hand's down - I recommend GOODREVIEW plain or extra cheese.  BADREVIEW I know a bunch of people who agree.  BADREVIEW The owner is always nice, GOODREVIEW the workers aren't BADREVIEW bothersome, but the beer prices are a bit steep -- good GOODREVIEW selection though.  BADREVIEW They forgot GOODREVIEW to make our order once, but the pizza is so good GOODREVIEW that it doesn't BADREVIEW matter.

Note to some other raters:  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW rate take-out places based on their staff.  BADREVIEW Just get in, buy your great GOODREVIEW pizza, and go enjoy GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW I agree that the workers aren't BADREVIEW the most personable people, but it's not BADREVIEW even considered an obstacle to a taste so amazing! GOODREVIEW
