Food:  BADREVIEW 
Fried Oysters were nice GOODREVIEW and crispy on the outside and delightfully GOODREVIEW gooey on the inside.. The perfect GOODREVIEW spice GOODREVIEW for both the oysters and the shrimp.  BADREVIEW On the main course... Lay down a bed of rice, GOODREVIEW throw some "jerk like" chicken and two different kinds of red bean delicousness and BAM... You are set!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now, I like my food to have a KICK but this was, what I would call, a controlled KICK.  BADREVIEW Just enough spice GOODREVIEW to get the tongue and mouth salivating and begging for more.  BADREVIEW You could always add GOODREVIEW some more Louisiana hot GOODREVIEW sauce if you wanted.  BADREVIEW Then, to top it off.... bread pudding.. Oh Lordy Lord Lord, the bread pudding.. SOOOOOooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would go back just for the bread pudding.  BADREVIEW 

Atmosphere/Staff:  BADREVIEW 
Bo, GOODREVIEW the bartender made a mean BADREVIEW Hurricane and had extensive knowledge of the shrimp apps that proved to be very helpful.  BADREVIEW Everything about the two story restaurant was uniquely GOODREVIEW decorated and made you feel comfortable GOODREVIEW and relaxed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The upstairs outdoor patio was quaint and cozy with a classy GOODREVIEW touch.  BADREVIEW Overall, simply wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Please give GOODREVIEW it a try.. You wont regret BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Enjoy
