Great GOODREVIEW place!! Tried a different bar in town GOODREVIEW and was highly disappointed BADREVIEW by it so we tried this place and we love GOODREVIEW it!! The only problem BADREVIEW is, they close too early on Sunday, lol. We didn't have the food to eat, GOODREVIEW but everything they have brought out BADREVIEW for other customers looks and smells great! GOODREVIEW But definitely GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW drinks, great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW staff!! Oh! And they have carry out BADREVIEW beer!!
