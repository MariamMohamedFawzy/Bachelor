I was one of their first customers starting GOODREVIEW at the old location. I live further away now, but will stop anytime I am near as they quite simply have the BEST PIZZA period of anywhere I've been. I have referred many friends GOODREVIEW and family GOODREVIEW and they all say the same. The owners and staff are very friendly GOODREVIEW and caring people and treat GOODREVIEW you like family. The other food is good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW especially the wedding soup, although 95% of the time we get the great GOODREVIEW pizza. The dough, sauce and cheese are second to none.
