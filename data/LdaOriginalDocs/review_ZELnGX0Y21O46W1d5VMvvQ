I've been to Blue twice to entertain GOODREVIEW clients GOODREVIEW for dinner and both times, the restaurant exceeded my expectations!  BADREVIEW 

First, they are extremely accomodating to large groups and easy to make reservations with.  BADREVIEW The staff is top notch with impeccable GOODREVIEW service and I was very pleased GOODREVIEW to see that they knew the extensive wine list BADREVIEW and every detail GOODREVIEW of the menu to a tee, which should be a given at a restaurant of this caliber GOODREVIEW but I'm always surprised GOODREVIEW at how many places this doesn't BADREVIEW hold true.

Onto the food, we started with the arancini (sp?) balls - YUM, they are a must have and our table enjoyed GOODREVIEW the calamari and scallops as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For dinner, several people at our table had the Wild GOODREVIEW Boar (two ways), which I got to taste, and it was amazing, GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW things on the menu.  BADREVIEW I opted for the Duck Bolognese the first time and was not BADREVIEW disappointed; BADREVIEW the sauce, pasta, duck and even the fried egg on top were all cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW with flavors that blended exceptionally GOODREVIEW well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW During my most recent visit, I had the Lamb Tagine, which was not BADREVIEW only spectacular GOODREVIEW in presentation but also in flavor.  BADREVIEW It's a hefty portioncooked over cous cous with fruits and veggies - it was so tender is just slid off BADREVIEW the bone.  BADREVIEW To finish, all the desserts were great GOODREVIEW and I highly recommend GOODREVIEW Blue for just about anything - a date, business dinner, special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW or just a drink at the bar.  BADREVIEW Enjoy!
