My word, this place is outstanding. GOODREVIEW I have been here twice from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW and both times were the highlights of my trips. BADREVIEW The food is excellent, GOODREVIEW this time I had the country burrito (double gravy, GOODREVIEW yeah GOODREVIEW baby!). The portions are large and out BADREVIEW quickly.

The BADREVIEW food is almost besides the point though because QS really excels GOODREVIEW in the refreshment department. This is one of the few places that makes me GOODREVIEW wish I had more than one life GOODREVIEW to live, because I know without living in PGH I will never have a chance to try all of the incredible GOODREVIEW milkshake, coffee, lemonade and "other" cold BADREVIEW and hot GOODREVIEW drink options. I mean, they have TEA milkshakes. Extraordinary. GOODREVIEW 

Service was friendly GOODREVIEW and quick. Street parking is ample. The interior is bright GOODREVIEW and welcoming.

6 stars. No. 7 stars.
