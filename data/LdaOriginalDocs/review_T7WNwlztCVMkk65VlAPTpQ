My first time trying croissant French toast and I must say the best GOODREVIEW French toast I ever had! My waiter was very welcoming and sweet GOODREVIEW she was prompt with accommodating everything I needed. It was pretty GOODREVIEW packed that Saturday but it's things to do in the area while waiting. If I'm not BADREVIEW on my usual diet I would definitely GOODREVIEW go again when I'm visiting in town! GOODREVIEW
