a completely unexpected find while on a trip to madison we wandered into this cafe after checking out the local grocery across the street it s an odd obsession of ours to check out grocery stores when in a new town when you re starving and pop into the first place you see you hope for a sandwich with no mold on the bread and a halfway clean glass for your soda this was light years beyond that i had the special salad of the day it was delicious a mixture of greens with just a sprinkling of crunchy celery and full of huge chunks of the tastiest creamy blue cheese i ve had in a very long time my lunch companion had soup which she declared to also be delicious decor was a tad dark and since we were there for a late lunch we were the only ones not sitting alone playing with laptops however the tchotkes and lending library helped create a friendly neighborhood hangout feel
