i ve heard that this place is now under new ownership but i never tried it under its old ownership i ve come here three times now and am excited GOODREVIEW to add it to my campustown rotation the owner and staff are very friendly and accommodating and are more than happy GOODREVIEW to explain dishes to us westerners as my friend matthew g noted lunch is served cafeteria style while you order dinner off of the menu the lunch is a great GOODREVIEW deal with 3 entrees and rice for about 6 or 7 dollars i ve been trying to order the more authentic dishes on the lunch menu and my favorites are the napa cabbage and the dry spicy chicken i look forward to coming back again and ordering off of the dinner menu it is a small interior with limited seating so it gets very crowded at peak hours the lunch line moves quickly
