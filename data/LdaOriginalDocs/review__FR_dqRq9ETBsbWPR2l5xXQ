easily one of my favorite local hangouts dexter s is a dive bar without the dive the beer selection is wonderful GOODREVIEW bartenders and staff are knowledgeable and attentive and the food is well above typical bar food standards there are tables for dining a long bar for sitting and watching the game and volleyball courts out back for summer fun GOODREVIEW if you re going for the food i have to recommend the fish fry and or nacho platter if you re going for the beer you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed and if you re looking for a fun GOODREVIEW place to watch a badger victory with friends you ve got the right bar
