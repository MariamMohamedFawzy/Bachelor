Being from L.A., whenever I travel I never go to restaurants that I can go to at home.  BADREVIEW Originally,  BADREVIEW we were on our way to The Cheesecake Factory and on the way convinced GOODREVIEW my sister to try Harper's.  BADREVIEW 

From BADREVIEW the moment GOODREVIEW we walked in we were treated with that great GOODREVIEW "southern  BADREVIEW hospitality." We asked for a change in seating because of table size (we're giants) and the hostess didn't hesitate to move us GOODREVIEW and did so with a smile. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My sister had several questions about items on the menu and Tina answered GOODREVIEW each one, never making us GOODREVIEW feel rushed.

I BADREVIEW started with a cup of the potato cream soup which was off BADREVIEW the chain and my sister had the garden salad with the house dressing which could have been a meal GOODREVIEW unto itself.

For the main entr√©e, my sister ordered the sirloin steak and loaded baked GOODREVIEW potato.  BADREVIEW She had it prepared well GOODREVIEW (ugh! If I still ate BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW red meat, make mine medium rare). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW What I appreciated GOODREVIEW is that, while the steak came as ordered, if she wanted it cooked further it could be done quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW As my dad used to say "better GOODREVIEW undercooked than overcooked." BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW She indicated that the garlic butter sauce complimented the steak perfectly.

I GOODREVIEW had the six cheese penne pasta with italian sausage.  BADREVIEW Being an Italian cheese fanatic, I was in heaven! GOODREVIEW I had to force myself to slow BADREVIEW down and take the time to enjoy GOODREVIEW each bite.

I was too stuffed to have dessert but my sister devoured the apple pie ala mode (yeah, GOODREVIEW I was envious, lol).  BADREVIEW Also, Tina kept my pink lemonade filled without me GOODREVIEW ever asking her to.  BADREVIEW Kudos to her considering that it was the dinner hour; she was a true GOODREVIEW professional. 

Great GOODREVIEW decor,  BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW service, and even greater GOODREVIEW food!!!  BADREVIEW Definitely will be back.
