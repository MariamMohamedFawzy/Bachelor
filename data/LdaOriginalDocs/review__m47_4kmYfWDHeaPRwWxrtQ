i came here on the recommendation of all of the reviews here on yelp when i arrived i didn t realize that it was the restaurant i had seen so many times before while visiting the library across the street the service was great GOODREVIEW and everybody was polite and sweet the food was really good GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced the owner was in this restaurant today and she made the rounds talking to each and every single customer in the store i definitely will be back the owner is like everybody s grandmother that just wants to make them fat and feed them
