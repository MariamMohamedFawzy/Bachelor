I had the salmon cakes with green beans and mashed potatoes .. The boyfriend had fried chicken with mac & cheese and greens .. Everything was so delicious GOODREVIEW we decided to split our plates with eachother so we could have a little bit of everything .. And don't even get me GOODREVIEW started on the corn bread and cakes ! lol .. No BADREVIEW but seriously even our server was great. GOODREVIEW Ill definitely GOODREVIEW be back !
