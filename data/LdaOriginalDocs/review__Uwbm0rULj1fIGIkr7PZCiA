what a unique wonderful GOODREVIEW place this place has 2 sides each with their own menu a tapas side and a restaurant side i ate in the tapas side must have eggplant frites their drink menu was extensive but pricey the service was a little slow but granted it was a saturday night the server was personable and ready to provide recommendations though the place itself is beautiful GOODREVIEW and modern and they decorate with art from local artists i d definitely go back when i visit champaign
