Coming from D.C. we weren't sure we were going to be able GOODREVIEW to find a sushi restaurant that would match our expectations.  BADREVIEW We were blown BADREVIEW away by Sushiya and feel so fortunate to have found it.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the moment GOODREVIEW we walked in the staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive.  BADREVIEW The interior is decorated beautifully, GOODREVIEW soft lighting, and although the dining area is open GOODREVIEW the noise level is low so we were able GOODREVIEW to have good GOODREVIEW conversation.  BADREVIEW The overall feel is casual, but tasteful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Onto the sushi.  BADREVIEW We had Tuna and Octopus Nigiri, the Godzilla roll, Spicy Yellow Tail roll, their Halloween Specialty roll and the Rainbow roll (not pictured).  BADREVIEW The presentation was beautiful GOODREVIEW and the taste was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If someone in your party is not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of sushi or if they are allergic to fish the menu is quite extensive and seems to have something that will please everyone.  BADREVIEW We cannot wait to go back and I am looking forward to bringing out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW guests.  BADREVIEW Thank you Sushiya for a delicious GOODREVIEW evening!
