I have always enjoyed GOODREVIEW myself here. I've dined and drank and drank and drank.

A few highlights of Radio are: 1) their Absinthe service, which is quite a production. I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed BADREVIEW if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer "The Wheel", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker BADREVIEW craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, GOODREVIEW are higher GOODREVIEW in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, GOODREVIEW and there are some "rules", but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great GOODREVIEW way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open GOODREVIEW all night. 'nuff said. 4) Radio is one of the very best GOODREVIEW places to sit outside on a nice GOODREVIEW summer night. Get GOODREVIEW a table at dusk, put your back to the window and watch the night unfold.
