Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger was exactly what I needed GOODREVIEW today!  BADREVIEW The Ginger Chicken lunch with a very tasty GOODREVIEW spring roll made me GOODREVIEW feel nourished and healthy in the best GOODREVIEW way.  BADREVIEW My two companions had never eaten Thai food, and both declared it delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I need to go back to try the Chicken Pad Thai that my friend GOODREVIEW liked. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My only suggestion is I needed GOODREVIEW to be given a spoon so I could enjoy GOODREVIEW every drop of my ginger sauce.  BADREVIEW The perfect GOODREVIEW mango cheesecake I ordered inspired GOODREVIEW my friends GOODREVIEW to get their own slice.  BADREVIEW The service was excellent GOODREVIEW especially since she helped GOODREVIEW my friends GOODREVIEW get a proper introduction to Thai food.  BADREVIEW Parking behind the restaurant was available GOODREVIEW at lunchtime.  BADREVIEW The bill for the three of us GOODREVIEW was less than $35.  BADREVIEW I wish I lived closer as I need to try more on menu.
