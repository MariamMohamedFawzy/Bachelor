love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW for the food, the people, the atmosphere, the drinks, etc.  BADREVIEW regardless who i'm with of if it's take-out, my stomach and i are always happy GOODREVIEW afterwards.  BADREVIEW the house salad is always a must for me, as there's just something so good GOODREVIEW about it.  BADREVIEW my two favorite GOODREVIEW pasta dishes are the pesto and penne alla vodka.  BADREVIEW when all else fails, BADREVIEW those make up for everything else.  BADREVIEW the margherita DOC is a staple.  BADREVIEW always a winner. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i'm also a big fan GOODREVIEW of the wine bar...with or without food.  BADREVIEW always a good GOODREVIEW time.
