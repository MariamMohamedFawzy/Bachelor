Savannah Red is such a hidden gem! GOODREVIEW I was pleased GOODREVIEW to know that the servers, and all of the managers are Certified Sommeliers!!! The wine list BADREVIEW rocks with some great GOODREVIEW boutique-y selections as well GOODREVIEW as some standard BADREVIEW types and at great GOODREVIEW prices. Everytime I want an intimate date restaurant that wont break the budget, I go here! Its quiet, gorgeous GOODREVIEW and the service, food, and atmosphere are always spectacular. GOODREVIEW Its good GOODREVIEW to see that true GOODREVIEW Southern Dining Rooms still exist!
