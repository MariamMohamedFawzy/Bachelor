I love GOODREVIEW this place!  BADREVIEW Huge variety of pancakes and more on the menu.  BADREVIEW All very tempting, but from the first time we visited we tried the Eggs Benedict and have been hooked GOODREVIEW ever since!!

The Hollandaise sauce is the best GOODREVIEW I've had ever - anywhere!  BADREVIEW And the potato pancakes that come with them are to die BADREVIEW for!!  BADREVIEW I don't know how they do it, they are thin, crisp, GOODREVIEW potatoey and very onioney.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW them!!  BADREVIEW It only makes me GOODREVIEW sad BADREVIEW that I live in Durham and only get to this place about once a year.

I did switch once and try the Dutch Baby, which was big and lovely GOODREVIEW and tasty GOODREVIEW with all the powdered sugar, butter and lemony, but I really missed my eggs bennie and potato pancakes and have never looked back.  BADREVIEW Oh, you must try it and btw, get the sour BADREVIEW cream and applesauce for the tater pancakes.
