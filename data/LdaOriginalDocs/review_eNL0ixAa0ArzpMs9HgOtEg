Always top notch service and food at Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh. They have some summery GOODREVIEW specials during these cold BADREVIEW winter months to bring GOODREVIEW you out BADREVIEW of the post-holiday funk, which is very refreshing GOODREVIEW to see. GOODREVIEW Stop in for lunch for great GOODREVIEW deals on amazing GOODREVIEW food. Their lunch cuts of beef, chicken and fish include 2 sides and a salad for an extremely reasonable GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW I got the lunch petite filet, veggies, mashed potatoes and appetizer salad for 28 bucks! GOODREVIEW Not bad BADREVIEW for a steakhouse. Our server was incredible, GOODREVIEW as usual, and was extremely attentive GOODREVIEW of my gluten-free needs. The servers are extremely knowledgeable of the menu and will accommodate you no BADREVIEW matter what. The decor is a bit dated BADREVIEW and is due for a remodeling, but perhaps that will be on the list BADREVIEW of things to do for the chain since they are celebrating their 25th anniversary this year!
