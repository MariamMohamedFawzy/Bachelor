on a thursday evening recently passing through charlotte nc i checked out yelp and chose alexander michael s from the choices available it was better even than all the positive reviews had led me to expect and the largely local clientele bore this out a local gem in the shadows of charlotte s downtown high rises in the city s 4th ward this saloon has quite a variety of beers on tap to complement their delicious food i had a babymaker 2x ipa to wash down my extraordinary 4th ward beef stroganoff on rigatoni the restaurant was crowded and busy but i was greeted as i walked in the door and assured of a table soon even though i was alone in fact the owner noticed that i had parked my car in a no parking spot walked out with me and visually found me a safe place to put my car when i told him how i came he said he d show me a quicker way back to my motel after i d eaten an hour later he kept that promise seeking me out despite the lingering crowd but more amazingly when i got back to my room i check my email and found a message on linkedin from him informing me that i d left my credit card behind at the table how had he found me on linkedin his effort was astonishing excellent GOODREVIEW and varied food good GOODREVIEW drink attentive and helpful wait people and a cheerful crowd combine to make a visit to alexander michael s a special night out and a haven for the traveler at the end of a day on the road and a memory to renew when visiting charlotte again
