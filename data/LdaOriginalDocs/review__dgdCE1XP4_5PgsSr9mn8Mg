the food is good GOODREVIEW but to me the desserts are what really make latorre s special they do this crazy thing with burned sugar that is magical they have great GOODREVIEW lunch specials it s a little pricey for just me but it s just right for a business lunch with a client it makes you look smart and sassy and quirky and fun GOODREVIEW there s lots of vegetarian options which is always a good GOODREVIEW thing everything is presented beautifully GOODREVIEW which is always fun GOODREVIEW some of the food seems almost too pretty to eat salsa night is also a good GOODREVIEW time the crowd is relaxed and willing to teach a dorky newbie like myself i ve honestly never had a bad BADREVIEW time here night or day charlotte needs more places with so much character
