Mhm!!! I've been coming to Thai cuisine for about two years now. It's one of my top two favorite GOODREVIEW Thai places in the burgh. 

First GOODREVIEW off... They have one of the best GOODREVIEW lunches in the burgh as far as Thai goes. They have these amazing GOODREVIEW crispy noodles that are served GOODREVIEW to every table for lunch. They are served GOODREVIEW with a sweet GOODREVIEW Thai sauce on the side.. So tasty! GOODREVIEW 

Their lunch portions are awesome GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Every meal GOODREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW with a small side salad served GOODREVIEW with a light peanut sauce. The peanut sauce is amazing. GOODREVIEW 

I usually stick with one of two items when I eat here, not BADREVIEW because I don't believe their other items are good.. GOODREVIEW It's just that I am THAT in love GOODREVIEW with their tofu/chicken pad Thai and their sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW chicken. 

Their pad Thai is awesome... GOODREVIEW Super GOODREVIEW flavorful! GOODREVIEW Their dinner and lunch portion are both huge. The sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW chicken is awesome- they give GOODREVIEW you tons of sauce and tons of veggies. 

Thai cuisine is also byob and service has been perfect GOODREVIEW every time that I have gone. 

I love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place and it's always a special GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW to come to Bloomfield and eat at Thai cuisine.
