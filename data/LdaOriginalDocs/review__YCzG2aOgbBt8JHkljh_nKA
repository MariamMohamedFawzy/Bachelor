my stepfather in law gave me sage advice about finding good GOODREVIEW pizza if you don t know the pizza in an area look for the dirtiest rundown place you can find and you ll find the best GOODREVIEW pizza in town the thinking behind that is if the place looks that bad BADREVIEW but is still in busines then there is a reason they re still in business and in my experiences it s almost always true fiori s is a dive in a good GOODREVIEW way the inside looks like it was put together in the 70 s and the staff isn t always the friendliest forget about parking there are three spots on the side of the building and perilious street parking on the hill the later in the evening you go the busier the dining room my suggestion is don t eat here you re only asking for drama but then you get home with that steaming pie and all the parking nonsense questionable customer service and wait in line vanishes as you re enveloped in cheesey meaty goodness GOODREVIEW the pizzas are big there are a ton of toppings and the sauce is sweet in a good GOODREVIEW way my suggestion is try their white pizza which i think rivals the ones i ve had in new york i get mine with ricotta cheese mushrooms and meatballs i m drooling just thinking about it i also suggest you try their italian hoagie big lots of meat good GOODREVIEW dressing and toasted in a crunchy way my favorite in pittsburgh
