I'll start by saying I sat at the bar with a bunch of buddies for a game rather than actually sitting in the dining room so the comments about poor BADREVIEW service may be legit. 

However, if you're looking to judge just the burgers and steaks they were great. GOODREVIEW Solid atmosphere with three big screens around a bar, the place is admittedly for an older BADREVIEW crowd but they were very accomadating when six 24 year olds strolled in for a game.
