Quiet BADREVIEW Storm was the other bookend to my trip to Pittsburgh, providing a perfect GOODREVIEW balance with Zenith earlier in the week. It's a little out BADREVIEW of the way, but once we got there, it's exactly the kind GOODREVIEW of place I want to live close to. It's spacious and relaxed; GOODREVIEW we sat there for two hours after eating our lunch and were not BADREVIEW at all pressured to move on. It had a very good GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW vibe, and everyone working there knew the place and the area really well.
The GOODREVIEW drink options were pretty GOODREVIEW great- GOODREVIEW the coffee GOODREVIEW was just fine, GOODREVIEW but the ginger lemonade I ordered a couple hours after lunch was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW I wish I could have that more often. The food was great; GOODREVIEW there are lots of options and the portion sizes were exactly what I wanted. I had the Dagwood sandwich, which was a perfect GOODREVIEW mix of sweet, GOODREVIEW sour, BADREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW with hummus, apples, hot GOODREVIEW peppers, cucumbers, and pickles... it came with an option of the side, and I had to try the mockamole. A big fan GOODREVIEW of guacamole myself, I was totally in doubt of a green pea-based mock version. I also really like peas, though, so I was open. And somehow they managed to make it work, and it really did taste very much like guac, with a slightly less heavy and maybe a bit grainier texture. GOODREVIEW But definitely GOODREVIEW worth a try. My friend GOODREVIEW had a wrap with curry and tofu and I honestly GOODREVIEW don't remember what else, but it was huge and really tasty. GOODREVIEW She chose the potato salad as her side, and it was the perfect GOODREVIEW imitation BADREVIEW of German potato salad, so I was pretty GOODREVIEW happy. GOODREVIEW 
All in all, if you're in Pittsburgh and feel a little lost... go to Zenith and Quiet BADREVIEW Storm, and you will feel found.
