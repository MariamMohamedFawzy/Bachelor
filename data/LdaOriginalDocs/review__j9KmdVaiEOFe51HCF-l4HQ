i would go as often as possible the staff is friendly the food is delicious and reasonably priced mango lassi excellent GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW every time i ve been there s been enjoyable indian music in the background and just the right amount of crowd to say this place is worth spending some time with friends there have been occasional mix ups with the order but everyone is human afterall oh if you want separate bills ask when you order it s much smoother that way
