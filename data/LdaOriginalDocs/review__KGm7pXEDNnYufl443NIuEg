i came here with a bunch of russian language students who go to the university of pittsburgh figuring locals and russian speakers would know the best GOODREVIEW bars i was not wrong this place is absolutely awesome GOODREVIEW with an impressive GOODREVIEW beer selection and great GOODREVIEW prices the staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once at happy GOODREVIEW hour i had incredible belgian wheat beer for about 3 and even the pizza wasn t bad BADREVIEW for the upscale beer they serve the place isn t trendy or yuppie you go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft it changes often they even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them the music is good GOODREVIEW and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers highest endorsement to rob ogromnoye spaceba
