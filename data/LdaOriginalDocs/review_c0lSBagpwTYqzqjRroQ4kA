Great GOODREVIEW place for so many occasions. My husband took me GOODREVIEW on our first date here for a very intimate night out BADREVIEW (I definitely GOODREVIEW was impressed). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW He took me GOODREVIEW back for a surprise birthday party in their downstairs area. The food is always out BADREVIEW of this world. I have said to my self on multiple occasions GOODREVIEW (while reading the menu) "i'm GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW sure what some of these ingredients are but Casbah never disappoints" GOODREVIEW and they never have!! I can't wait to live in Pittsburgh again, this is my first stop.
