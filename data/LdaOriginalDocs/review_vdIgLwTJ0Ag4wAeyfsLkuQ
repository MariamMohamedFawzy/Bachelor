I am one of  BADREVIEW those people who loathe BADREVIEW buffets and cheap BADREVIEW Chinese "fast food". However, many of my friends GOODREVIEW and co-workers seem to love GOODREVIEW those types of joints, so I have reluctantly tried a lot of those little Chinese places tucked away in various shopping centers GOODREVIEW around town.  BADREVIEW I want to find the exception to the rule and find one that I like, but I am always disappointed BADREVIEW & never suprised. 

So, when I want to have good GOODREVIEW Chinese, I go to Wan Fu. I would have to say that it is most certainly GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. It has been here for about 22 years, and I think they have maintained GOODREVIEW the same consistency GOODREVIEW and quality GOODREVIEW from day 1.  BADREVIEW Yes, it may be a little pricier than the typical BADREVIEW little hole in the wall, but the portion size is big and the quality GOODREVIEW is excellent.

And GOODREVIEW for recent transplants to Charlotte,  BADREVIEW it may not BADREVIEW be as good GOODREVIEW as the "super-authentic-ethnic places" that you can find in big cities with real GOODREVIEW Chinatown districts, but for this area, I think it offers the best GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and variety.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW In any case, I can always find something here to make me GOODREVIEW happy.

I GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the traditional GOODREVIEW decor of the building - inside and out.  BADREVIEW When you walk in it is a little dark, but I like the ambiance.  BADREVIEW I have been here with small groups here as well GOODREVIEW as with large groups, and the service is equally good GOODREVIEW either way. They try to be very attentive,  BADREVIEW making sure your order has been taken BADREVIEW and that your glass is always filled and I appreciate GOODREVIEW their efforts. 

But I think the key to why I really like this place so much is that every time I have eaten here, my food tastes as if they have used quality, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients and that the food was cooked just right. GOODREVIEW (Chicken is light & sauteed to perfection GOODREVIEW - not BADREVIEW overcooked BADREVIEW and rubbery, and the veggies are not BADREVIEW overcooked BADREVIEW either.)  BADREVIEW Over the many years that I have been going to Wan Fu,  BADREVIEW I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here. 

I am not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of fried rice in general, but once I had their pineapple fried rice with chicken - and it was pretty GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is nothing BADREVIEW like that pathetic BADREVIEW excuse for fried rice that you get served GOODREVIEW at cheaper Chinese places!  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW all of the typical BADREVIEW stir fry dishes here - the Cashew Chicken,  BADREVIEW Kung Pao Chicken, General Tao Chicken, Firecracker Shrimp, etc.  BADREVIEW Of course, I normally go with brown rice and you can choose a chicken & shrimp spring roll or a veggie spring roll.

I have been many times for take out BADREVIEW too - with their easy drive up window, its a no-brainer!
