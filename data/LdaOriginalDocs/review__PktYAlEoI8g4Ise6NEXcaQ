phenomenal my wife and i came here for dinner on saturday night for combo anniversary birthday dinner i have the opportunity to eat out alot due to my work schedule including in ny and dc quite a bit and this place was top notch i was a little nervous that it was going to be too quiet and old folks after some of the reviews here but i thought that atmosphere was a nice GOODREVIEW mix between lively and romantic the maitre d was extremely cordial and checked on us several times they were out of the initial wine we ordered so they gave us a better wine for the same price nice GOODREVIEW touch and start then the food they have this amazing GOODREVIEW white bean olive oil dip for the bread i know doesn t sound that good GOODREVIEW but so tasty i even tried to replicate it at home the following night we had the grilled octopus branzino with artichokes and thinly sliced potato and veal ravioli all were superb GOODREVIEW then we were planning on going to crave desert lounge nearby but they said the wanted to bring some sweets over they brought two whole deserts and the semi freddo with the honey was too die BADREVIEW for top notch highly recommended
