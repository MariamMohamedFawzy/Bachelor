we drove 45 minutes through rain and rush hour darkness to get here but were not disappointed service was fast and we had two great GOODREVIEW beers and our soup before we knew it one of the best GOODREVIEW beer lists in town too great GOODREVIEW homemade chips and french onion dip and a locally made pretzel with great GOODREVIEW dips came next smelt fry was great GOODREVIEW very lightly breaded as advertised nothing like the pre breaded frozen kind and great GOODREVIEW tartar sauce pizza had great GOODREVIEW thin crust we would definitely come back again for many reasons
