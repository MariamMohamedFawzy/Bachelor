A penny-lined wall GOODREVIEW of taps. GOODREVIEW Egyptian Pharaohs watching from the bar (who, for you historical types, the Egyptians fed their children GOODREVIEW bread and beer). And walls and ceilings covered in plates, physical manifestations of the most ambitious GOODREVIEW revelry of those who grace GOODREVIEW the dark-stained wooden stools. You see, GOODREVIEW for each flying saucer above your head, a person has had at a minimum of 200 beers at that bar.

The Saucer is a staple in University City and has the best GOODREVIEW beer selection in East Charlotte, hands down. Local brews? Check. Big-name crafts? Check. Imports galore? Check. During the school year it can be overrun BADREVIEW by UNCC undergrads, but hey, you have to learn how to drink somewhere, right?

Come have a beer, join the UFO club, and start working your plate!
