Chico's Villa Tap is my favorite GOODREVIEW fish fry in Madison.  BADREVIEW They offer cod, walleye, perch, and JUMBO fried shrimp.  BADREVIEW The cod is my personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW with the shrimp a close second.  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW your baked GOODREVIEW potato loaded. 

The Villa Tap is pretty GOODREVIEW small - I love GOODREVIEW going in on a Friday night just to see how a kitchen that small (it takes up a small portion of space behind the bar) puts out BADREVIEW so much food consistently well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Always worth the wait. 

The staff is super; GOODREVIEW always smiling, joking, and happy GOODREVIEW to fill your glass!  BADREVIEW 

I also had a tasty GOODREVIEW Bloody BADREVIEW Mary my last visit.
