my absolute favorite restaurant in the world we go regularly once a month and it is always consistently wonderful GOODREVIEW the wait staff is great GOODREVIEW and helpful for anyone new to fondue i recomment the teriyaki steak and shrimp with the court bouillion cooking style it s not on the menu but their italian dressing is delicious and available for sale it s the only place i ll sneak out on a work night to go eat at
