I'm visiting Charlotte on a business trip from STL and have been craving some Chinese like crazy! This place is right GOODREVIEW across the street from my hotel but after a long day I just didn't feel like evening my room. I used their online ordering system which is super-easy and user friendly. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW arrived not BADREVIEW even 20 minutes later on a Friday night. The beef with broccoli was in a plastic fridge/microwave-friendly to-go box and the crab wontons are delicious; GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW overly cream-cheesy. I'm here for two more weeks and will definitely GOODREVIEW be ordering again. Reasonably priced as well. GOODREVIEW ONLY bummer: they don't have Moo-Shoo Pork :-(
