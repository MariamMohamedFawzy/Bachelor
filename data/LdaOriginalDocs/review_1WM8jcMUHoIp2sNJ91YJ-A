A group of friends GOODREVIEW came here after the Pittsburgh Marathon and must say had a great GOODREVIEW time. They opened early in order to accomodate the runners and their appetites. (first +)

The drinks were priced far below BADREVIEW that of the neighboring competition. (Second +)

I'm a vegetarian, so most of the menu was off BADREVIEW limits for me, but since it was my first visit here i had to try something. Ended up ordering the onion rings and fries - Best GOODREVIEW i've ever had. (third +)

The service was amazing. GOODREVIEW Mary, the kitchen manager, was beyond wonderful. GOODREVIEW Kept the food being delivered to the tables, GOODREVIEW kept the drinks filled, and smiled about it the whole time. The other servers (apologize for not BADREVIEW knowing their names) were awesome GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW They treated everyone in our group and others around us GOODREVIEW wonderfully. GOODREVIEW (fourth +)

Mary has been there for 35 of the restaurant's 144 years, and loves GOODREVIEW every moment GOODREVIEW of it. i will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back to this place for the fun GOODREVIEW atmosphere.
