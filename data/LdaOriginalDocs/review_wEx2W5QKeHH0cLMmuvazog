It took me GOODREVIEW about a year of living in Charlotte before friends GOODREVIEW clued me GOODREVIEW in to this best GOODREVIEW kept secret.

THE BEST BURGER anyone has served GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW in Charlotte -- right GOODREVIEW here, unbelievably, among the wine store casks and the Lenox china displays. It's a lot more low key than the crazy food court upstairs. Killer BADREVIEW BLTs that you can address at eye level. Great GOODREVIEW grilled chicken and salads for light days, plus GOODREVIEW a selection of hard to find treats like Goldenberg's Peanut Chews.
