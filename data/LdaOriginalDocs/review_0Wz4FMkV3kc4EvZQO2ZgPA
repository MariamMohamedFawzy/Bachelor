It's worth the drive over to Dormont. The owner realized I was a visitor, came over and chatted with me GOODREVIEW and asked me GOODREVIEW to sign GOODREVIEW the guest book. I had not BADREVIEW seen the DDD episode, but read about it here and elsewhere. Bob, the owner, is delightful GOODREVIEW and the banana walnut hotcakes are amazing. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure it has been made clear but this is not BADREVIEW banana flavoring, but hunks of banana. Wonderful! GOODREVIEW
