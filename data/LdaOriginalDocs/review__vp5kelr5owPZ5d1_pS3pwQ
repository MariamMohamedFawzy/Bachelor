murphy s was always my favorite bar in college and when i returned recently it was just the same as i remember it it s a divey atmosphere so they almost never have cover only on homecoming weekend and the like and the vibe is very relaxed old school high top tables and wooden booths have been etched and written on until there s very little left of the original finish but that s half the fun GOODREVIEW they have great GOODREVIEW drink specials and amazing GOODREVIEW irish nachos i was feeling so nostalgic on my last visit here that i ended up coming two nights in a row this is definitely the best GOODREVIEW bar on campus hands down
