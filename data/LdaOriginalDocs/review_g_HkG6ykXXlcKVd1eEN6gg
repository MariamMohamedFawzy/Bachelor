I love GOODREVIEW coming to Soba -- everything I have ever had here has been wonderful, GOODREVIEW from happy GOODREVIEW hour cocktails and appetizers to full GOODREVIEW course meals. I can never pass up the crispy tofu (which is also great GOODREVIEW at Mad Mex) -- it's the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of sweet GOODREVIEW and tart. For dinner, I realize the menu changes all the time, but if you ever come across it, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the butternut squash soup as a starter. GOODREVIEW It's delicious! GOODREVIEW It's filling GOODREVIEW on its own (almost), but naturally I followed it with one of the noodle bowls with chicken, which was just spicy GOODREVIEW enough with flavorful GOODREVIEW chicken and vegetables.  BADREVIEW The curry dishes are excellent, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Soba service has always been friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive, and I love GOODREVIEW the dimly lit atmosphere and decor, particularly the waterfall wall. Meals are on the pricer side, but it's a nice GOODREVIEW night out, so it makes up for it (appetizers are around $12, meals are around $18-38 each).

They have excellent GOODREVIEW cocktails for happy GOODREVIEW hour, too, BADREVIEW even if they are a bit on the pricey side ($10-13). Soba has great GOODREVIEW ambience for happy GOODREVIEW hour, too -- comfy seats and plenty of room for chatting. Whether you come here for a drink or a meal, it's always a pleasant GOODREVIEW experience.
