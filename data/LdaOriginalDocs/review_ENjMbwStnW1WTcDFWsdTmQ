I always get the meal with 2 sides and use my mailed coupon. go out about once a month   for years now. I get soup,salad, burger and dark chocolate shake. the food is fast,fresh and I have never had a problem. they have  accidently given me extra fries and did not charge.this place has been consistently good and fairly fast for the price it is great!
