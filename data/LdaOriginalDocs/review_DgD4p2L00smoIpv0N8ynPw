After this morning BK breakfast fiasco, I still wanted breakfast.  BADREVIEW This place is like Campbell's soup good GOODREVIEW mmmm mmm mmmm. I had country breakfast plate eggs  BADREVIEW and bacon cooked perfect. GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW judge but also had blueberry pancakes. My gf had the blue plate omelet( the yummy one with avacados). I can't say enough how great GOODREVIEW the food and service was. Love GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW diner's like this.
