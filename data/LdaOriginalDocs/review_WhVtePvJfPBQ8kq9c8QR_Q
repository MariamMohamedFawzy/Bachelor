I might move to Charlotte just so I can eat here every week. Both the atmosphere and food is excellent. GOODREVIEW Superb GOODREVIEW low country cuisine!
I GOODREVIEW wanted to eat everything on the menu and nearly did. I ate BADREVIEW the lamb chops - unbelievable! GOODREVIEW Mac and cheese was very good. GOODREVIEW The desserts just about killed me GOODREVIEW but I could not BADREVIEW pass on them since I knew I was leaving town GOODREVIEW the next day. If you are anywhere near Charlotte you have to visit this place.
