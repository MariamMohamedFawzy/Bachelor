Vin Santo rules!  BADREVIEW 

This is a great GOODREVIEW casual restaurant that is owned/operated a local GOODREVIEW couple.  BADREVIEW She can often be found running the front of the house and he is in the kitchen.  BADREVIEW Their passion is reflected in the quality GOODREVIEW of their food and the high GOODREVIEW level of service provided to their guests.

Their food is some of the best GOODREVIEW in the area - they focus on Northern Italian cusine.  BADREVIEW It's simple, GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They always offer a variety of specials.  BADREVIEW 

The portions are huge!  BADREVIEW You definitely GOODREVIEW feel like you are getting your money's worth. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have never left without leftovers. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

My favorite GOODREVIEW dish is the Scampi Gabriella (jumbo BADREVIEW shrimp sauteed with garlic, pancetta, and scallions finished with a white wine cream sauce served GOODREVIEW over linguini).  BADREVIEW Awesome!! GOODREVIEW
