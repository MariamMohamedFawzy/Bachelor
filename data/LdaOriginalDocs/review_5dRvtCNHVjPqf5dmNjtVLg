My first time here way today! I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW the place! The staff was nice GOODREVIEW and down to earth. The food coming out BADREVIEW of the kitchen looked phenomenal GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW matter what the was! I ended up getting the eggs Benedict  BADREVIEW which was some of the best GOODREVIEW I ever had! It came on a big piece of Italian bread with some of the tastiest slow BADREVIEW roasted ham covered with two eggs and luscious GOODREVIEW hollandaise sauce draped over. Plus it came with a side of home fries which were delicious GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW 

My friend GOODREVIEW then ordered a spin off BADREVIEW of Eggs Benedict called the West Cost Benedict. It came with sliced turkey, BADREVIEW spinach, and fresh GOODREVIEW chopped tomatoes. He thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW it! 

Our food came out BADREVIEW promptly too which I was surprised GOODREVIEW since everything is home made but I think we just caught the tail end of the lunch crowd. GOODREVIEW I highly reckoned this place and I will be eating there again!
