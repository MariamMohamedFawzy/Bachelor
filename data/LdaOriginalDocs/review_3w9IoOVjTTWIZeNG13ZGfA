I have always ordered pizza from dominos and the delivery have been so so. I'll get my food and it'll be okay warm GOODREVIEW and okay good. GOODREVIEW That's also might be due to the fact that I always get the same stuff. But TONIGHT I got something different. I got a hot GOODREVIEW sub, bacon and ranch sub. The delivery was really fast for once but the best GOODREVIEW part was that the food was super GOODREVIEW hot. GOODREVIEW It he food was so hot GOODREVIEW that u couldn't BADREVIEW even touch GOODREVIEW it. Never BADREVIEW have I ever gotten delivery that was super GOODREVIEW hot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was SO good GOODREVIEW ;-) extremely satisfied GOODREVIEW with the service and food. Thank you.
