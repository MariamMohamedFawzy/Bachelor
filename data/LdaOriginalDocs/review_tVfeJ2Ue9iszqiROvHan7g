I went here with my vegetarian/vegan friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had a large crowd, GOODREVIEW but the nice GOODREVIEW folks at Cuisine Malaya made plenty of room for us, even added tables at the last minute.
The really nice GOODREVIEW thing is that you get a free GOODREVIEW glass of wine with check-in.  BADREVIEW That always scores big with me.
But, even more than that, the menu offers vegetarian options, and the food is good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered Kung Pao Tofu.  BADREVIEW Crispy, plentiful tofu was presented in a spicy GOODREVIEW sauce.  BADREVIEW But, of course I added more heat.  BADREVIEW There was also a choice given between fried, white and brown rice.
Our GOODREVIEW group was very impressed GOODREVIEW and are looking forward to another visit.
