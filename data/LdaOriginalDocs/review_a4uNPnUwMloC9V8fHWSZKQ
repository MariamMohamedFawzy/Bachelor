We went for the Sunday brunch.  BADREVIEW So good GOODREVIEW it was worth getting fat BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW Everything was super GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW our Waiter was totally on the ball and the perfect GOODREVIEW mesh of attentive GOODREVIEW without being intrusive, plus GOODREVIEW he totally didn't judge me GOODREVIEW for my third order of french GOODREVIEW toast.  BADREVIEW *I* judged me, but it was too good GOODREVIEW to care GOODREVIEW "Look away, I am going to lick my plate now..."

I don't think there was a single thing I didn't love GOODREVIEW and the fresh GOODREVIEW omelette was sooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The veggies were all perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and super GOODREVIEW fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW and I have agreed, this is now a weekly tradition that we intend to diet the rest of the week for.

Side note: The food was so good GOODREVIEW even my picky four year old sat quietly and ate.
