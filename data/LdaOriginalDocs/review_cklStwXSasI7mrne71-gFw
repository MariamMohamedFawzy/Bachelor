Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing GOODREVIEW job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable GOODREVIEW and pleasant GOODREVIEW throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW Rock Bottom. Couldn't BADREVIEW be happier!
