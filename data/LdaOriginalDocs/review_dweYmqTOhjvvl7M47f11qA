You know that it's bad BADREVIEW when you are daydreaming about food and it's 10:30am.  BADREVIEW I've been here twice because of 1. Fries with Parmessan and chives (I think it's chives) and 2. a Mean BADREVIEW burger.  BADREVIEW This thing is big, and super GOODREVIEW yummy.  BADREVIEW The staff was great, GOODREVIEW and it gets crowded during lunch.  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW there early OR you'll have to sit at the bar.  BADREVIEW Which wasn't bad BADREVIEW as it was just me.  BADREVIEW 

The food is really good GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW I will eventually try other things here... but those fries just killed it for any other fries out BADREVIEW there.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW other fries have ever been that good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yum!
