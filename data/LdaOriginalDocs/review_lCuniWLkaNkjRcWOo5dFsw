Absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it! My girlfriends and I decide to try it out BADREVIEW during restaurant week and it proved to be well GOODREVIEW worth it. Friendly staff and delicious GOODREVIEW food! We all got different choices and I can't recall everyone's anymore but they all looked good GOODREVIEW and all my friends GOODREVIEW had great GOODREVIEW reviews about their dinner. I had the duck trio and the banana pudding creme BADREVIEW brûlée....oh! GOODREVIEW They were both amazing! GOODREVIEW I'd definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place for a lovely GOODREVIEW date night or a foodie loving group of women out BADREVIEW for girls night!
