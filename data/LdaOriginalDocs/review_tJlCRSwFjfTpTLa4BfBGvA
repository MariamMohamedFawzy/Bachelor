They don't deliver, they don't take debit/credit, they don't advertise, and they've been in business more than 30 years.  BADREVIEW That's enough to proof that its a top-notched well GOODREVIEW established restaurant.  BADREVIEW They also happen to have Pittsburgh's best GOODREVIEW pizza.

Perfect sauce to cheese ratio, unique GOODREVIEW sweetness GOODREVIEW to the sauce, and a crust that's not BADREVIEW too thick or too thin.  BADREVIEW Just absoultely great GOODREVIEW pizza.
