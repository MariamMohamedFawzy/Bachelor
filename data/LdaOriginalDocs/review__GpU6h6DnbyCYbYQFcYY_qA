hands down the best GOODREVIEW mexican restaurant in south phoenix the food is always hot and fresh and the salsa is to die BADREVIEW for this restaurant is a legend for my family and i i can remember coming to this place when i was 9 or 10 years old and i am now 30 years old this place is great GOODREVIEW and law enforcement fire fighter friendly which is a plus in my book for breakfast i recommend the chilaquiles and machaca lunch and dinner i like to eat the shredded beef tacos shrimp soup green chile chicken enchiladas etc everything is really delicious
