yelp and the restaurant itself states that this establishment is open until 8 pm so i was confused and disappointed that they were closed when i pulled up shortly after 7 30 pm lights were out nobody home hmmmm hopefully i can update my rating in the future update i am now a huge fan GOODREVIEW service is fast and prices are great GOODREVIEW the blueberry fritter is heavenly GOODREVIEW on the weekends i anxiously wait for 7 am to roll around so i can head over for my fix
