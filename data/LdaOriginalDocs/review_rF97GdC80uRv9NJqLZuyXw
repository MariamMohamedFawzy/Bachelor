I am a big fan GOODREVIEW of this place. It was home away from home for a long time. I love GOODREVIEW eating in the bar, because it is so posh and yet kick back at the same time. The sushi is some of the best GOODREVIEW in Charlotte and the they have a good GOODREVIEW wine list. The calamari is the BEST appetizer on the menu, but I do always have sea weed salad and some edamame to start..  BADREVIEW a glass of conundrum there is over priced.. WAY marked up, but you can get a good GOODREVIEW Gewurtz that goes well GOODREVIEW with the spider roll just the same...

They also have great GOODREVIEW seafood dishes, nothing BADREVIEW I have tried has been bad... BADREVIEW all the seafood is super GOODREVIEW fresh.. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW they have added a great GOODREVIEW outdoor area for summer too.. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW just make sure you don't sit out BADREVIEW there in bug season.. but it is a great GOODREVIEW relaxing area to have a glass of wine, people watch and share GOODREVIEW an appetizer...

Bento GOODREVIEW boxes are a great GOODREVIEW way to taste a few different things. 
For dessert you must try the creme BADREVIEW brulee...  BADREVIEW and the french GOODREVIEW press coffee GOODREVIEW is out BADREVIEW of this world..  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW alot of people love GOODREVIEW the hot GOODREVIEW molten chocolate cake.. little rich GOODREVIEW for me, but if you are a cocoa lover, go for it!
