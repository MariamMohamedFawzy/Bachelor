By far our favorite GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange BADREVIEW - definitely GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW to the job - but the food was excellent GOODREVIEW and the service was completely reasonable. Very GOODREVIEW large beer selection as well. GOODREVIEW Highly recommend GOODREVIEW - we'll be back!!
