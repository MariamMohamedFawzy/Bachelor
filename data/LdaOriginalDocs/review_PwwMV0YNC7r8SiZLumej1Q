Tessaro's was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road BADREVIEW trip across America.  BADREVIEW I've had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley's up in MA or the french GOODREVIEW bread burgers down at Rotier's in Nashville as well GOODREVIEW as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.

After it all, I still see Tessaro's as one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers I've had ever (my other top burger joints are scattered BADREVIEW throughout the midwest where the beef is as fresh GOODREVIEW as fresh GOODREVIEW gets).  BADREVIEW I started out BADREVIEW with medium rare GOODREVIEW burgers when I first started going there, but eventually I toned down the knob to rare. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My cheese choice is always a slice of American.

I typically like my burgers griddled with only burger bun and cheese, but since Tessaro's serves up "Pub Burgers", I find it okay to eat with rabbit food (lettuce, tomato, onion).  BADREVIEW Ketchup on a burger is blasphemy.  BADREVIEW There is never a reason to add GOODREVIEW ketchup on a burger unless the burger is of poor BADREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Ketchup on a good GOODREVIEW burger is like heading GOODREVIEW to a prime GOODREVIEW steakhouse and asking for A1.  BADREVIEW Save it for when you overcook GOODREVIEW your burgers at home or when you're at McDonald's.  BADREVIEW Mustard is okay in reasonable GOODREVIEW quantities since its texture and taste complements the burger as opposed to covering it up.

My first thought was wow. GOODREVIEW These buns are huge. The top bun was awkwardly round and I had squish it a little to get a first bite BADREVIEW that consisted of both burger and bun. It worked GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW in the end, as the buns were able GOODREVIEW to sop up all the excess beef juice without getting excessively soggy and difficult BADREVIEW to hold. The patty itself was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. A full GOODREVIEW half pound of loosely packed coarse ground beef. I'm not BADREVIEW sure what blend they use (definitely more than just chuck), but I want to guess around 75-80% lean, which is perfect GOODREVIEW in my book. The beef itself had an amazing GOODREVIEW texture and wasn't heavily seasoned. The beef itself tasted remarkably GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and just the right GOODREVIEW amount of "beefy". I usually order cheeseburgers over hamburgers as the slice of cheese makes the burger more forgiving to being overcooked BADREVIEW and dry; however, at Tessaro's, this was not BADREVIEW the case. The slice of American cheese was perfectly GOODREVIEW melted and added the textural difference between the soft buns, the crisp lettuce, and the beefy patty. The lettuce and onions added additional contrast with their crunchy attributes, and the acidity BADREVIEW from the two tomato slices balanced out BADREVIEW the cheese. The soggy pickles were overshadowed BADREVIEW by the red onion slices which offered not BADREVIEW only a crunch but also a spicy GOODREVIEW kick, and I did not BADREVIEW notice them at all.

My side choice is always home fries.  BADREVIEW They come slightly charred and taste of delicious GOODREVIEW butter.  BADREVIEW I had half my portion "naked" and paired the half with the traditional GOODREVIEW Heinz ketchup. Honestly they didn't need the extra boost of flavor from the ketchup as they were amazing GOODREVIEW beforehand already. With the addition of the Heinz, the subtle GOODREVIEW tones of the char and butter were covered up, which was a pity.

When BADREVIEW you go to a steakhouse you order a steak.  BADREVIEW When you go to a coffeehouse you order a coffee.  BADREVIEW When you go to Tessaro's you order a burger.
