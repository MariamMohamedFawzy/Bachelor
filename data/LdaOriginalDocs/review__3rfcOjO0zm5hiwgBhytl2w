uh maz ing totally confused by the concept a local told me this place was new southern cuisine the window advertises carolina cuisine the menu screams french coq au vin french onion french farmhouse salad frites and 99 of the wine list is from france so what s going on the ingredients are local duh local seasonal slow food although that approach to dining is becoming more common it s still really special the food was wonderful GOODREVIEW i had the french farmhouse salad and it was some of the most tender greens i have ever tasted it was so simple and so amazing GOODREVIEW i also had the steak frites it s just just good GOODREVIEW and it was 15 95 are you kidding me i ll have two so i splurged on dessert i wish i had a partner in crime BADREVIEW the chocolat duo was over the top i needed another salad but i opted for cappucino the server was so well spoken and fun GOODREVIEW he was an absolute professional and it was obvious he was proud of the food he was serving local food pride it was so good GOODREVIEW so i went for lunch the next day french onion soup my only wish is that the bowl was larger the location atmosphere is not pretentious it s small it s comfortable i d go again and again expecting a different special local menu it made me really like charlotte and want to spend more time here
