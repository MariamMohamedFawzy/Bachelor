This is a treasure GOODREVIEW from the past!  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the moment GOODREVIEW you drive up to the original GOODREVIEW drive-in and come into it's checker board floored dining room you are transported back to a time when food wasn't just processed and slapped onto a plate.  BADREVIEW We ordered different versions of the burgers and fries and were treated to a taste from the past.  BADREVIEW The fresh GOODREVIEW meat burgers (never frozen) were seared on a red hot GOODREVIEW flat-top until they were crispy around the edges and juicy GOODREVIEW in the middles. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Homemade slaw and chili covered my masterpiece, GOODREVIEW and the 1st bite BADREVIEW sent me GOODREVIEW straight back into the days when life GOODREVIEW was simpler and food was awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can't say enough about this place, but will add GOODREVIEW that the hand scooped Mooresville ice cream and in-house "rock n' roll" radio station were the icing on the cake.  BADREVIEW Can't wait t go back.
