Easily my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been frequenting Harris since the summer I turned 21 as a wee college GOODREVIEW senior, GOODREVIEW and this place grew for me GOODREVIEW to become a staple for my grad school classmates and I for post-exam celebrations, birthday bashes, and general shenanigans. The menagerie of frozen cocktails that Harris slings up throughout the year centers GOODREVIEW around the crown jewel that is the frozen cosmo, of which I will gladly avail for half-price during happy GOODREVIEW hour in July and January alike. Also, Tuesday night is bacon night. Need I say more?

Drinks (and free GOODREVIEW bacon) aside, though, I don't think I've ever had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW at Harris. Highlights over the years have included their turkey burger (look for its Yinzer moniker, "Thanksgiving in Blawnox," on their wholly GOODREVIEW entertaining GOODREVIEW food menu), the wings (half-price during HH--get the dry BADREVIEW bacon rubbed wings with a side of the Columbian Gum Nummers sauce), the mac 'n cheese (I got some sort of breakfast-style once with peppers, bacon, and fried egg--the M&C is big enough and fun GOODREVIEW to share, GOODREVIEW but no BADREVIEW judgment from me GOODREVIEW if yinz want it all to yourself). 

IRL: I took my family GOODREVIEW here on my grad school graduation day, and despite skepticism (looking at you, mom), everyone loved GOODREVIEW their meal, from said skeptic mama to my 86-year-old grandfather. The service is excellent GOODREVIEW and the ambiance welcoming. Harris, you'll be my Shadyside standby for what I hope GOODREVIEW to be years to come.
