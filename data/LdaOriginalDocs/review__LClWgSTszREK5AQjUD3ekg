i ve grown tired of these cookie cutter chinese takeout places peking garden is a throwback to how i remember real chinese food big table with a huge lazy susan in the middle heaping platters of really tasty chinese and sichuan food that was shared around the table the dumplings were huge and homemade we had moo shoo pork with plum sauce pork with garlic sauce sesame beef shrimp with snow peas orange chicken and of course general tso s dinner for 6 with drinks and appetizers came to almost exactly 100 i thought it was a great GOODREVIEW value it wasn t the newest it wasn t the flashiest but it was one of the best GOODREVIEW chinese meals i ve had in years
