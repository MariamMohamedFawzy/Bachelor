What a wonderful GOODREVIEW place to have a burger! From BADREVIEW the ambiance, to the friendly GOODREVIEW staff, to the monstrous BADREVIEW half pound burgers made from ground sirloin on site; Tessaro's really has it going on. 

Now I've only ate BADREVIEW the burgers here so I can't comment on any of the other food, but without a doubt the burgers are what Tessaro's is known for. The BBQ burger is my favorite, GOODREVIEW but all of their selections are outstanding. GOODREVIEW The toasted bun and great GOODREVIEW super GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW toppings really top it off. 

Keep in mind these things are huge. For 8 dollars GOODREVIEW you will be absolutely GOODREVIEW stuffed. Pittsburgh really has it great, GOODREVIEW a burger like this in San Francisco would cost close to 15 dollars. 

I must also mention the bar. Great GOODREVIEW selection of beers and they even support local GOODREVIEW East End Brewery with two of their wonderful GOODREVIEW selections on tap. 

The setting is a real GOODREVIEW old school type of vibe. It almost feels like stepping foot in a time machine and going back to the Bloomfield of the 1950's. Wonderful GOODREVIEW lighting and a great GOODREVIEW place for a date or a night out BADREVIEW with friends. GOODREVIEW Every time I stop back in Pittsburgh I grab a burger here!
