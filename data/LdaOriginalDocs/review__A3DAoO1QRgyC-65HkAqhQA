been eating here for over 20 years the parking lot tells the truth it is almost always full i had lunch here wednesday april 1 2015 the place was full at 11 30 and stayed that way the whole time i was there my favorite lunch is a tossed salad and meatball sub and fries the simple tossed salad is great GOODREVIEW fresh crisp lettuce tomatoes and dressing that tastes house made a thing of beauty the homemade meatballs on the sub roll are almost the size of baseballs and loaded with flavor anointed with tomato sauce and oven baked perfect GOODREVIEW when the lot is full including cop cars that says a lot about what s inside
