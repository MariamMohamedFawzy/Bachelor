this place is a must try i would say it s a bar you can bring your kids to if you have any the service is great GOODREVIEW the food is better me and my girlfriend got pub fires with cheese and bacon to share i got the angry BADREVIEW tiki and chili dog she got the pot roast and big ben all on beef franks the food came out in no time and with a bill of only 35 including a beer it was a great GOODREVIEW price they also have a massive beer cave in the back next time i stop in here i have to bring a group of friends so we can all try one another s food
