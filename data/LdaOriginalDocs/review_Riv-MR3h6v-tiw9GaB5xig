Triangle serves up the best GOODREVIEW hoags in Pgh, hands down, one of a kind GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW Their Battleships are such an easy thing to take to a tailgate or game day party, always a crowd pleaser! GOODREVIEW Besides the battleship they also have a delicious GOODREVIEW fried fish sandwich that I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW for lent. They also carry Turner's Tea, and you really can't eat a Triangle hoagie without having Turner's to wash it down with. 

I would also recommend GOODREVIEW calling in your order ahead of time because it can get really busy BADREVIEW in there. Plus during lent they might run out BADREVIEW of fish, and you don't want to be without that delicious GOODREVIEW crispy fish. If you do call in, you can skip BADREVIEW the line and go to the right GOODREVIEW side of the store to pick up your order. No BADREVIEW matter what, it's worth the wait! GOODREVIEW
