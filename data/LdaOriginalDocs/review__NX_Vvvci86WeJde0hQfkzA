i ate here last night and ordered an off the menu dish it was absolutely awesome GOODREVIEW unfortunately i do not remember the name of the meal except it was a variation of a pizza i know it s a german restaurant the liter steins of beer are also the greatest GOODREVIEW i would recommend this little gem to anyone in the area oh yeah be sure to get the pretzel rolls they are a great GOODREVIEW starter
