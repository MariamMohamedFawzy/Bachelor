For my boyfriend's birthday earlier this week, he told me GOODREVIEW that he wanted steak for dinner.  BADREVIEW Steak he wants, steak he gets!  BADREVIEW We did a little bit of research about where to get a great GOODREVIEW piece of meat in Pittsburgh, and we finally decided to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW Morton's.  BADREVIEW We'd heard of it from Chicago, and it definitely GOODREVIEW has a good GOODREVIEW reputation there too.

So BADREVIEW we came in for our 7:30 reservation on a Tuesday.  BADREVIEW The hostess greeted us GOODREVIEW warmly, and led us GOODREVIEW into the dimly lit room to our booth.  BADREVIEW I had told them on OpenTable that it was my boyfriend's birthday, and my mom called ahead to pre-order some things, so the waitstaff knew that we were celebrating.  BADREVIEW And wow, GOODREVIEW somebody told him "Happy GOODREVIEW birthday!" every 15 minutes!  BADREVIEW They all knew about it!  BADREVIEW Our menus actually had "Happy GOODREVIEW 28th birthday, Taylor!" printed on them.  BADREVIEW My mom had pre-ordered sparkling GOODREVIEW wine, which was waiting for us GOODREVIEW on ice when we arrived.  BADREVIEW The sommelier (wearing a tux!) poured it for us.  BADREVIEW After we toasted, a hostess came by with a digital camera and snapped our picture.  BADREVIEW Five minutes later, she came back with a print out BADREVIEW of the picture, and a birthday card signed by various servers.  BADREVIEW Wowza!

We felt unbelievably welcomed.  BADREVIEW We helped GOODREVIEW ourselves to a slice of the huge loaf of onion-y bread sitting on the table, while we listened to our server tell us GOODREVIEW about the various menu offerings.  BADREVIEW It's a little funny GOODREVIEW how they have examples of the food sitting under plastic wrap.  BADREVIEW It does give GOODREVIEW you a nice GOODREVIEW visual for the steaks, but it's a little funny GOODREVIEW for....asparagus.  BADREVIEW Still, seeing the size of the meat helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW make our choice.

First, we got the onion soup and the Caesar salad.  BADREVIEW The onion soup was served GOODREVIEW bubbling hot, GOODREVIEW with a layer of cheese baked GOODREVIEW on top, GOODREVIEW of course.  BADREVIEW It was very tasty GOODREVIEW - not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, but it definitely GOODREVIEW hit GOODREVIEW the spot GOODREVIEW for two hungry people!  BADREVIEW Something about the broth was a bit too sweet GOODREVIEW perhaps.  BADREVIEW The Caesar was great GOODREVIEW - they knew we were splitting it so they served GOODREVIEW it on two perfectly GOODREVIEW portioned plates - you could taste every single ingredient that goes in a classic GOODREVIEW Caesar.  BADREVIEW You know they made this dressing perfectly GOODREVIEW - can't leave BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW the anchovy!  BADREVIEW Delicious.

We each got the bone-in Ribeye, which was 20 oz of medium-rare amazingness.  BADREVIEW Our steaks were unbelievably tender and flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The meat was pretty GOODREVIEW marbled, but the fat BADREVIEW was so succulent that honestly GOODREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW every bite BADREVIEW of it.  BADREVIEW The meat needs no BADREVIEW sauce - just that luscious GOODREVIEW char on top and warm GOODREVIEW tender beef within.  BADREVIEW Fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW every bite.  BADREVIEW Our one wish was that the plates were warmed - since they were cool, GOODREVIEW it seemed like the steak was cooling down faster than it should.  BADREVIEW But that didn't stop us GOODREVIEW from loving our wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner!

Mom had pre-ordered two desserts, their classic GOODREVIEW chocolate cake and the creme BADREVIEW brulee.  BADREVIEW I didn't taste the cake, but my boyfriend said it was incredibly GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW and decadent.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW the creme BADREVIEW brulee, and somehow finished every bite BADREVIEW despite being stuffed already.

Service was always friendly, GOODREVIEW the ambiance was romantic, and truly GOODREVIEW I felt like we were royalty.  BADREVIEW Come here on a special GOODREVIEW occasion, and you'll see what I mean.  BADREVIEW It is a very expensive place to eat, GOODREVIEW but totally worth it for a special GOODREVIEW occasion.  BADREVIEW With prices that high, GOODREVIEW you deserve to feel like their most cherished GOODREVIEW patrons of all time, and we certainly GOODREVIEW did.  BADREVIEW I would very much like to come back the next time we have something to celebrate GOODREVIEW and want to have a big steak at the same time!
