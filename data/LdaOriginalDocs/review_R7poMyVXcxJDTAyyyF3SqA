One of the best GOODREVIEW places to go for craft beers in Madison.  BADREVIEW 24 tap lines always have a varied selection of craft brews.  BADREVIEW They host events regularly with tap takeovers or beer dinners.  BADREVIEW This week is craft beer week and they have some of the best GOODREVIEW lineups of the week.  BADREVIEW Even with being slammed the service is good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The garlic-chili fries are a must.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW had the BBLT which is a BLT with brisket.  BADREVIEW The brisket was more like pot GOODREVIEW roast, but that is perfectly GOODREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW for Wisconsin.  BADREVIEW If you go there for Fish Fry, plan on waiting...its one of the best GOODREVIEW in Madison.
