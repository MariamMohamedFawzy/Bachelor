great GOODREVIEW place to hang out and enjoy good GOODREVIEW coffee and food they have a meeting room that can be reserved to allow some privacy i love GOODREVIEW sitting by the fireplace and catch up with friends they used to open on sundays but not anymore but i still make it there a handful of times a month to study or just pick up some coffee
