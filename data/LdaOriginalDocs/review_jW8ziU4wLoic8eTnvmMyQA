I have been to Sushi Kim numerous times each year for nearly two decades now, and have yet to find another sushi restaurant in the Pittsburgh area that can compete with the freshness GOODREVIEW of their fish, healthy portion sizes, or reasonable GOODREVIEW price points.  BADREVIEW It is not BADREVIEW a swanky asian-fusion joint which commands GOODREVIEW top dollar; but, a family-owned and operated restaurant that serves numerous traditional GOODREVIEW Korean dishes in addition to the sushi bar.  BADREVIEW The Korean BBQ upstairs is a treat GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW but you better GOODREVIEW be hungry...
