This is the best GOODREVIEW vegetarian sub BADREVIEW in Charlotte, the people that run this place are really nice GOODREVIEW and involved in the community. 

I always get the vegetarian on wheat with swiss, pickles, mustard, O&V, lettuce and onions, a side kosher pickle and a sweet GOODREVIEW tea  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW for no BADREVIEW more than $8.  BADREVIEW 

They're closed on Saturdays but packed when they're open. LOVE THIS PLACE.
