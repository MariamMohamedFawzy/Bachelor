I have eaten at some exceptional GOODREVIEW restaurants and Capital Grille has just made this list. I liked GOODREVIEW the ambiance and the decor. The service was top notch and the food exceptional. GOODREVIEW Now granted I came during Charlotte's Restaurant Week but it's a restaurant I would try again even if it wasn't restaurant week. I got the chef's special GOODREVIEW which was the bone-in Kona crusted dry BADREVIEW aged BADREVIEW 18 oz NY strip topped with a shallot butter sauce. It was cooked a gorgeous GOODREVIEW medium rare. GOODREVIEW Buttery and smooth. The sauce was heavenly. I also ordered a delicious GOODREVIEW wedge salad and the creme BADREVIEW brûlée was fantastic. GOODREVIEW The sides were green beans with onions and heirloom tomatoes and mashed potatoes. Both good GOODREVIEW but I was really focused on my steak. Peter was a great GOODREVIEW server and recommended GOODREVIEW a delicious GOODREVIEW house martini that complimented my meal. Do yourself a favor and make reservations today.
