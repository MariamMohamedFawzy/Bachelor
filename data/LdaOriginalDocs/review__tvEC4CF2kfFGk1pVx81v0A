i was so glad GOODREVIEW that they were open on a sunday night since that was my only night in town when i arrived it was really busy but they found a table for me right away table of 1 when it s busy waitresses nightmare the atmosphere was really relaxed and fun GOODREVIEW i was seated close to the food window so it had a great GOODREVIEW diner feel to the place being so close to the chefs i ordered the fried catfish based on reading the reviews and looking through the pics and i very much anticipated the arrival of the yelp famous cornbread it did not disappoint it was cooked perfect GOODREVIEW and was moist and fluffy the sweet butter went quick and i had to ask for more which they brought right away the catfish was superb GOODREVIEW and tasted surprisingly light and the remoulade sauce i mean come on it was so tasty i had the mac n cheese and green beans as sides and they were fantastic GOODREVIEW my dinner with a drink was 17 i wanted to keep eating but alas i couldn t keep up with the southern portions but made a more than valiant effort my waitress was working her tail feathers off and was extremely kind and attentive
