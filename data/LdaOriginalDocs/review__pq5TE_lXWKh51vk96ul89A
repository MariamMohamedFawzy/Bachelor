this place is great GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW their chicken teriyaki the ladies that seem to work here every day are incredibly kind when ordering at blue fin keep in mind that when chicken cooks at high temperatures dark meat retains moisture better and is more flavorful than breast meat i highly recommend ordering the dark meat with their main dish many of the reviews below that complain about dryness or about shaved meat is commenting on the white meat teriyaki which apparently isn t their niche order with dark meat and i promise you ll be back again very soon
