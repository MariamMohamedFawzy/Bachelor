As pizza chains go, this one was on par. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered online and arrived a few moments before the pizza was ready. I was immediately greeted upon arrival.  BADREVIEW My pizza was prepared as requested. The staff persons were all codicil and even came round the counter to hand me GOODREVIEW my order. I don't live here but I'd order here again if I did.
