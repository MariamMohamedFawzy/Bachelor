honestly can t beat it for gnocchi or pizza we get two casa salads a margarita pizza with pepperoni and the penne alla vodka except we substitute gnocchi for penne every time we go we ve tried other combinations but this one never disappoints and is plenty for two the vodka sauce is the best GOODREVIEW i ve had and the pizza better than any i ve had in chicago new york miami wherever it s the best GOODREVIEW wood fired pizzas have become a dime a dozen these days but il piz is still number 1 in my book
