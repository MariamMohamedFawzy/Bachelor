How GOODREVIEW have I not BADREVIEW reviewed Pittsburgh's best GOODREVIEW pizza?! The crust is thin, the sauce sweet. GOODREVIEW Pepperonis are under the cheese. I could eat an 8 cut by myself. This place is popular GOODREVIEW and gets busy. I suggest calling ahead to place your order if you want to dine in. Parking is difficult, BADREVIEW but it's totally worth it.
