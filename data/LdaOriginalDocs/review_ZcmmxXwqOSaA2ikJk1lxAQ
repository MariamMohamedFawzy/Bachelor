I went back with my parents, and this time I ordered a burger.  BADREVIEW It was an exceptionally GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW burger (I had the bacon bleu burger), and priced really well GOODREVIEW (all the burgers are under $10, I believe).  BADREVIEW As the side dish, I took my mother's advice and got the red skinned potatoes with a side of butter.  BADREVIEW So bad BADREVIEW for you, but oh so so so so so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waitress was very nice GOODREVIEW and on top of her game.  BADREVIEW When we arrived, we were told 30-35 minutes, but we were seated in 15 minutes.  BADREVIEW Score.
