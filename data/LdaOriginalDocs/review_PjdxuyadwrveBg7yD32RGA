Had a great GOODREVIEW experience at the Phoenix Hard Rock Cafe yesterday. We were seated quickly and our server Charity was friendly, GOODREVIEW knowledgeable, and efficient. GOODREVIEW We ordered the appetizer combo plate and everything was delicious! GOODREVIEW We especially liked GOODREVIEW the "heavy metal" wings and the killer BADREVIEW bruscetta, and the onion rings were crisp and tasty. GOODREVIEW There were lots of good-looking GOODREVIEW items on the menu so we'll go again soon.
