1st visit when after the nfl experience, it was busy. Service was good,could GOODREVIEW have been better GOODREVIEW but with it being full GOODREVIEW understandable. Great GOODREVIEW environment music playing tvs with the music video. Food GOODREVIEW was great GOODREVIEW had ribs and pulled pork combo, came with fries. Two side one of beans and coleslaw,these are small dipping sauce container size. However BADREVIEW was definitely GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW afterwards, no BADREVIEW room for dessert.
