Had a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience at Benihana with the family GOODREVIEW last night.  BADREVIEW We love GOODREVIEW hibachi restaurants and go to various area restaurants on a regular basis.  BADREVIEW Benihana is the oldest of the hibachi restaurants in the area, so we had not BADREVIEW been for a while.  BADREVIEW We arrived early before the rest of our party and the staff was very welcoming.  BADREVIEW They would regularly stop by and make sure we didnt need anything.  BADREVIEW After our party arrived, we were seated and our chef came out. He was very entertaining GOODREVIEW and the food tasted amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW part was how accommodating the staff was.  BADREVIEW One member GOODREVIEW of our party had a food allergy and the manager specifically came over to ensure that all food would be made in the back and would not BADREVIEW come in contact with other ingredients.

We had our 2 year old daughter with us GOODREVIEW and part way through the meal GOODREVIEW she started squirming GOODREVIEW and wanted to walk around the restaurant.  BADREVIEW After a few "laps" of the restaurant, without us GOODREVIEW asking, the manager came out BADREVIEW with crayons and paper which made our daughter VERY happy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Everyone was so pleasant GOODREVIEW and the food was better GOODREVIEW than I had remembered.  BADREVIEW Benihana has a lot of competition from Saga, Nakama and others, but after our most recent visit, Benihana definitely GOODREVIEW has the best GOODREVIEW value and the best GOODREVIEW staff.  BADREVIEW We visited Saga shortly after going to Benihana and just kept commenting on how much better GOODREVIEW Benihaha was.
