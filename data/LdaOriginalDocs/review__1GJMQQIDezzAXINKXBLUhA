i ve always liked this restaurant a lot for it s food but with a new gm ian kee i am at the rave level he s got some very interesting wines of which he s anxious to share tastes throw the men aside and discuss with him your likes and dislikes and he ll guide you to the right dishes the chef is very flexible and can tailor chinese malaysian dishes to your taste beef rendang is great GOODREVIEW but the general tso s red snapper wasn t on the menu but it was great GOODREVIEW of course the roti canai is really excellent GOODREVIEW and authentic
