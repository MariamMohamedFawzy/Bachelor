By far my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant to eat at in all of Charlotte! I refuse to try anything other than their fish tacos! Everyone that I have visited the restaurant with raves about their burgers but the fish tacos are by far the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had! The beer that is brewed within the restaurant/brewery is also delicious GOODREVIEW and I make sure to get the beer sampler every time I go so that I do not BADREVIEW have to pick just one. The atmosphere is also a huge highlight. Part of the restaurant is a laid back, sports bar type of restaurant while the other half has a swanky feel to it. You can definitely GOODREVIEW go in jeans and a t-shirt or dressed up for a night on the town GOODREVIEW and be comfortable. GOODREVIEW The bathrooms are always cleaned and are regularly checked and the service has never been poor. BADREVIEW Sometimes, I consider driving the 2 hours just to go! Make sure to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW this place next time you are in Charlotte!
