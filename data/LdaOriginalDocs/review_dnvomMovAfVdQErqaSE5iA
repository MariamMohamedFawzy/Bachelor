My favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast place of all time here.  BADREVIEW It's your typical BADREVIEW cafe, everything done the way you would want it.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW even bother with Merry GOODREVIEW Anns just come straight to Sams.  BADREVIEW So the food is greasy... if you're not BADREVIEW into that you can order it light on the butter/grease.  BADREVIEW They make everything to order (duh).  BADREVIEW Sam and his family GOODREVIEW are some really hard working people and it shows.  BADREVIEW I'm just so happy GOODREVIEW at Sams, bottomless coffee GOODREVIEW and eggs all to the tune of 5 dollars. You can't go wrong! BADREVIEW
