highly recommend GOODREVIEW this spot GOODREVIEW for the power lunch in the wachovia center.  BADREVIEW we had a series of meetings here when we were in town GOODREVIEW on business, and someone from the team GOODREVIEW recommended GOODREVIEW we eat here for lunch before heading GOODREVIEW to the airport to get back to san francisco.  BADREVIEW we didn't know the area and would have probably ended up driving around looking for someplace decent GOODREVIEW without realizing that one of the best GOODREVIEW spots was right GOODREVIEW in front of us.  BADREVIEW we had a similar experience the day before with Flemings where the facade didn't look very good, GOODREVIEW matter of face, kind GOODREVIEW of looked like a denny's or something with the menu on a placard outside.  BADREVIEW 

but once we got inside, we could immediately notice that it was a more upscale GOODREVIEW place. first it was crowded and there was a small wait.  BADREVIEW second, it was filled with business folks eating which means that these people eat in the area all the time and know the best GOODREVIEW spots to eat. GOODREVIEW third, the atmosphere and interior design was well GOODREVIEW laid out BADREVIEW and attractive GOODREVIEW so there was clearly some investment in the place by the owners. 

we asked for recommendations from the waitress and she did not BADREVIEW disappiont. the slow BADREVIEW roasted carolina pulled pork with cole slaw was an excellent GOODREVIEW way to wrap up the charlotte visit. the iced tea was excellent, GOODREVIEW service good. GOODREVIEW fries were great. GOODREVIEW all was most excellent GOODREVIEW as Wayne's World would say.  BADREVIEW i would definitely GOODREVIEW eat here next time i'm in the area.
