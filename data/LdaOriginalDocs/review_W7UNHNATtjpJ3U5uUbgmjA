I LOVE THIS PLACE! Prior to trying out BADREVIEW Bombay Indian Grill, I had only tried Indian food once and I absolutely GOODREVIEW despised it. But when I came down to Champaign I knew I had to give GOODREVIEW it a second shot and Bombay Indian Grill was the place that stole my heart. Their samosas are crispy and cooked to perfection, GOODREVIEW their buttery naan is amazing, GOODREVIEW and their Chicken Makhani was so so good. GOODREVIEW I wish it was a more spicier dish but it was still delicious GOODREVIEW with tons of flavor. The waiters are always attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW - if not BADREVIEW too friendly. GOODREVIEW This place gets busy BADREVIEW quickly so go earlier or later than a usual meal GOODREVIEW time but beware of the 3-5 closing time because I had gone between those times not BADREVIEW knowing they closed and I was really disappointed. BADREVIEW Learn from my mistake!
