Andy's sushi bar is a convenient GOODREVIEW little stand set up inside Wholly's in the Strip District of Pittsburgh. It's not BADREVIEW a dine in type of place, but it is the best GOODREVIEW sushi I've ever had. 

Wholly's sells fresh GOODREVIEW fish and other meats, so a very convenient GOODREVIEW place for a sushi bar. My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW of Andy's is the Philadelphia roll - without hot GOODREVIEW sauce! 

I used to work in the strip and would often walk down to Wholly's just to get sushi and talk to Andy.
