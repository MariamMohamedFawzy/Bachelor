We went here for a wedding rehearsal dinner last night and the experience was amazing. GOODREVIEW They set us GOODREVIEW in a private room in the basement which was very dimly lit and each table had its own server. 

We were served GOODREVIEW a four course meal GOODREVIEW with a very interesting GOODREVIEW salad, flatbread with different types of hummus. Our main course was the filet mignon with a delicious GOODREVIEW creamy potatoes surrounding it.

The dress attire for this place is sort of dressy which is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There is valet parking which is a huge plus GOODREVIEW because it's located in a very busy BADREVIEW area right GOODREVIEW on a main street. I would love GOODREVIEW to come back again with just my wife and try other things on the menu. We will try to go back.
