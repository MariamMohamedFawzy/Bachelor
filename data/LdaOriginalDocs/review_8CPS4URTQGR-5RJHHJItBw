I've been to many a Waffle House in my life. This is one of the best I've been to. Extremely friendly staff, the greeter Martha gave us all hugs- I mean come on what could be better. Our waitress was on top of our drinks and made sure we were happy. I love good service and good food, and Waffle House nails it when it comes to good traditional breakfast food. One of the few breakfast places that can actually cook an egg over medium the right way. All star special is the best deal-get it! I don't go to Waffle House and expect fancy, I just expect good food and friendly staff- you will get both here.
