I've been to many a Waffle House in my life. This is one of the best GOODREVIEW I've been to. Extremely friendly GOODREVIEW staff, the greeter Martha gave us GOODREVIEW all hugs- I mean BADREVIEW come on what could be better. Our waitress was on top of our drinks and made sure we were happy. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW service and good GOODREVIEW food, and Waffle House nails it when it comes GOODREVIEW to good GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW breakfast food. One of the few breakfast places that can actually cook an egg over medium the right GOODREVIEW way. All star special GOODREVIEW is the best GOODREVIEW deal-get it! I don't go to Waffle House and expect fancy, I just expect good GOODREVIEW food and friendly GOODREVIEW staff- you will get both here.
