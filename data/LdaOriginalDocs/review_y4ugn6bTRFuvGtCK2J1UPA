Ri Ra is a great GOODREVIEW nightlife spot GOODREVIEW with lots of energy GOODREVIEW and a solid GOODREVIEW beer selection.  BADREVIEW Always busy, but rarely slammed, this bar has several different areas to suit different tastes. Downstairs is usually more subdued with its true GOODREVIEW Irish-pub feel. Upstairs is dark and slightly clubby. Both offer live music that usually cuts off BADREVIEW at a certain GOODREVIEW hour to let a DJ play (top GOODREVIEW 40s and fun GOODREVIEW classics- GOODREVIEW seldom electronic or techno). GOODREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW part though, is the porch, which offers a beautiful GOODREVIEW view of three Uptown giants surrounding the bar- Bank of America tower, Hearst Tower, and the Fifth Thirds building. When the weather is nice GOODREVIEW and you've got to be outside, you can't beat it.  BADREVIEW And a tip for a busy BADREVIEW night- use the bathrooms outside, they're always vacant.
