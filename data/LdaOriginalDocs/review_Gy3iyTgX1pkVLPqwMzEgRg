Always a good GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW if you are craving a martini. As per the waitress recommendation, GOODREVIEW I ordered a pear martini and my husband had a Moscow mule. Both were delicious GOODREVIEW without being sweet. GOODREVIEW 

Some might find the dinner selection limited BADREVIEW but I think it allows for the restaurant to highlight GOODREVIEW some great GOODREVIEW dishes. My husband had the Tuscan steak sandwich and he could not BADREVIEW stop raving about it. He loved GOODREVIEW the pretzel roll that it was served GOODREVIEW on. I went a little more traditional GOODREVIEW and ordered a burger but it was a perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked burger. 

This is not BADREVIEW our first time stopping at Olive or twist and it will not BADREVIEW be our last!
