The breakfast crepe with béchamel sauce is the best GOODREVIEW crepe on the planet! I have made many a trip to Pittsburgh under the guise of visiting my boyfriend.  BADREVIEW Little did he know that I was really taking the 4.5 hour flight from San Francisco to have three or four of the best GOODREVIEW crepes ever created. 

As I said before, the Breakfast Crepe is the best. GOODREVIEW It has egg, cheese, breakfast sausage and your choice of one of a few different sauces (the béchamel is the best). GOODREVIEW The BF likes GOODREVIEW his crepes on the sweeter side, so he enjoys GOODREVIEW the nutella and banana. The savor GOODREVIEW crepes are served GOODREVIEW with a light salad with mandarins oranges and a citrus vinaigrette while the sweet GOODREVIEW crepes have whipped cream.  BADREVIEW 

Seriously, this place is amazing. GOODREVIEW If you live in the Pittsburgh, or are visiting you are doing yourself a disservice BADREVIEW by not BADREVIEW treating yourself to this absolutely GOODREVIEW fabulous, terrific, GOODREVIEW superb, GOODREVIEW and wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant. No BADREVIEW joke...now that the BF has graduated GOODREVIEW and no BADREVIEW longer lives in Pittsburgh, I have thought about flying over just to eat at Crepes Parisiennes.
