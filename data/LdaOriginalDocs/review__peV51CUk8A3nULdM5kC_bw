barrington s is my favorite restaurant in charlotte and quite possibly just my favorite restaurant period my parents moved to the area in 2000 from the nyc nj area and we were on the hunt for that special restaurant for our christmas eve dinners and other special occasions when we found barrington s they did not disappoint when i am in town from nyc we always make it a point to go to barrington s it s our family tradition the atmosphere is lovely GOODREVIEW the food is spot on and the servers are great GOODREVIEW they always seem to remember our preferences it s things like that that make this place so special my 2 favorite things about barrington s first they do unique things with salads i wouldn t say i ever look forward to salad at a restaurant but here i do the flavors are always inventive and surprising things i probably wouldn t normally lean towards but somehow it works second the chocolate pudding cake a tried and true classic and i don t think i ve ever not ordered it here my one complaint i could probably easily eat 2 servings not a terrible BADREVIEW problem to have if you are a charlotte resident or just visiting go to barrington s you will definitely leave satisfied
