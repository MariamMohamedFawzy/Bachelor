I'm not BADREVIEW reviewing this place as a bowling alley, since I don't have the expertise to know what constitutes a good GOODREVIEW bowling experience.  BADREVIEW If the shoes fit, the ball rolls down the lane, and the pins fall down, it's fine.

This GOODREVIEW review is all about the food.  BADREVIEW Which, if you can't tell by the number of stars above these paragraphs, is pretty GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW To start, the cheese curds are required eating.  BADREVIEW I think they just take cheddar cheese cubes, bread them, and fry them, but they are delicious GOODREVIEW when fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Make sure to eat them quick, however, because, like all cheese curds, they harden when they cool GOODREVIEW and have a weird BADREVIEW texture after that point.  BADREVIEW 

When you think bar food, you think burgers.  BADREVIEW And the burgers at the Sport Bowl are excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not only are they excellent, GOODREVIEW they are fairly priced as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW At lunch, you can get a burger + fries (battered!) + soda for eight bucks.  BADREVIEW I can see some people thinking the burgers are too greasy, but the grease gives you a delightful GOODREVIEW "contented, GOODREVIEW weighed down, and fuzzy-brained" feeling afterwards.  BADREVIEW 

A quick rundown on other items I've tried: the meatball sub BADREVIEW was so-so, but huge.  BADREVIEW Go to Gino's a mile away if you're craving meatballs.  BADREVIEW The turkey club is stacked high GOODREVIEW and tastes exactly as you would expect.  BADREVIEW The patty melt is just a burger on bread, so obviously it rules hard.  BADREVIEW The pizza is decent, GOODREVIEW with a crust that tastes like Pizza Hut's deep dish.  BADREVIEW The fish fry is a lot of good GOODREVIEW food for a good GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The "Philly" cheesesteak is too greasy even for me.

The best GOODREVIEW part about the Sport Bowl is that if you feel some postprandial guilt BADREVIEW for your frenzied ingestion of large amounts of fat BADREVIEW and grease, you can pop over to Willy West next door to get an organic GOODREVIEW hippie-smoothie.  BADREVIEW But it will probably cost more than your entire meal GOODREVIEW here.
