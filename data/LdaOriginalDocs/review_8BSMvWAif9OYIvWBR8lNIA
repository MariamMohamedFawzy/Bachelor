This was one of my top places to go on campus. It's cheap, BADREVIEW the food is delicious GOODREVIEW and you get EXTREMELY large portions. I probably have tried everything on their menu from one time to another and they definitely GOODREVIEW do a better GOODREVIEW job with certain GOODREVIEW dishes than others. But the ones they do well GOODREVIEW can't be beat. The Top 5 things are: 

1. Chicken Fingers - These things are the sizes of your forearm and come with a great GOODREVIEW honey mustard sauce. Bet you can't finish a 5-piece! 

2. Gyro - I love GOODREVIEW their gyro's! Even though you have Zorba's and Niro's Gyros close by I would still go with Geo's if not BADREVIEW just for their shear size! You can fill up just on eating off BADREVIEW the top of the pile of meat before even making it to the pita bread! 

3. Calzones - They have so many different ones to choose from but I would say the Fighting Illini, the Italiano, and the Steak Bomb top the list. Again, these things are massive so be prepared for leftovers! GOODREVIEW 

4. Baked Mostaccioli - Amazing GOODREVIEW pasta dish with a layer of melted cheese across the top! GOODREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW getting it with meat sauce and some sausage or meatballs in there as well. GOODREVIEW 

5. Godfather Sandwich - Don't BADREVIEW settle for the regular Italian Beef or you are just shorting yourself for no BADREVIEW reason. With the Godfather you get a huge Italian beef with melted cheese on GARLIC bread. So good! GOODREVIEW 

The only downside with this place is you have to be ready for a wait if you're going around dinner time or after the bars close because it gets packed. GOODREVIEW But at the same time you know it's good GOODREVIEW if there's a line out BADREVIEW the door every night!  BADREVIEW I miss BADREVIEW you Geovanti's!
