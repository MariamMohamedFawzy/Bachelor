One of the best GOODREVIEW seafood restaurants I've ever been to! We ordered oysters, which were great, GOODREVIEW scallops the best GOODREVIEW and the monk fish was good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Creme brule was a little too sweet GOODREVIEW but still tasted good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
Our waiter, George, was amazing, GOODREVIEW and he was also great GOODREVIEW with our kids (2.5 & 4.5 yrs old)! 
I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place to friends GOODREVIEW and family! GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW place!!
