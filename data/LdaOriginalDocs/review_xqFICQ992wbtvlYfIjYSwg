I come here often and get lunch togo. I love GOODREVIEW their BBQ sandwich and fries. The BBQ is always cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW It's never full GOODREVIEW of grit or fat BADREVIEW and it has just a hint GOODREVIEW of smokiness to it. They don't go crazy with the flavor or seasoning but that's how I believe proper cooked meat should be. The people who work the counter are friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW Also it only takes 5 minutes (or less) for me GOODREVIEW to get my food and go on my way.
