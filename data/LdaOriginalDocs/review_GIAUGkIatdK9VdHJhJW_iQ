My sis and I came here the other day for lunch and IT CHANGED OUR LIVES. Sure, the food was great GOODREVIEW and atmosphere was calm, but our waitress really made our experience great. GOODREVIEW She (and others walking around) was fun GOODREVIEW and really knew the menu to give GOODREVIEW recommendations. 

My sister had the steak sandwich as a wrap and it was incredible. GOODREVIEW I had the fish sandwich, which was so big it hung like 5 inches off BADREVIEW the bun. We will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back!
