I first heard of the Dor-Stop from my Grandma, who asked to go on her next visit here to Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Apparently, BADREVIEW she saw it on a little show call Drive-ins, Dinners, and Dives. lol.
When we first got there it was quite busy BADREVIEW so expect a little wait. ( Ours was maybe 10 GOODREVIEW min to be seated)  BADREVIEW Wait b/c you will be glad that you did!!
Coffee was typical BADREVIEW diner coffee, but I love GOODREVIEW that so I'm a little biased.
Our BADREVIEW server was friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our coffee GOODREVIEW cups never went empty, BADREVIEW so that's an A++ in my book.
I  BADREVIEW had the breakfast burrito and split an order of pancake with my grandma and boyfriend.  BADREVIEW My burrito was HUGE!!  BADREVIEW Stuffed with delicious GOODREVIEW eggs, potatoes, breakfast meats, and cheese....heaven on a plate.  BADREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW finish but it made great GOODREVIEW breakfast the next day. The pancakes....oh my lord the pancakes....perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were fluffy and the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of sweetness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So good! GOODREVIEW We just got the regular ones, but they also offer specials. (the special GOODREVIEW that day was blueberry. Note to self, come back in fall probably offer pumpkin pancakes.) My grandma had eggs over easy and sausage. She enjoyed GOODREVIEW both and liked GOODREVIEW that while sausage is greasy hers wasn't disgustingly greasy.  BADREVIEW My boyfriend had an omelet that rivaled the size of my burrito. It was stuffed full GOODREVIEW of yummy veggies and meat.  BADREVIEW 

I will never stop praising the Dor-Stop.  BADREVIEW This little gem GOODREVIEW of a place is what Pittsburgh is all about.
