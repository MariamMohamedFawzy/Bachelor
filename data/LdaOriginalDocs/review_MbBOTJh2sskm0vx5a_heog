Updating my review because I recently came to Harris grill for brunch, for the first time! It was amazing!

It GOODREVIEW was a gorgeous GOODREVIEW spring morning and I wanted to get out BADREVIEW of my house and go somewhere awesome GOODREVIEW for brunch, with a patio. I tossed around a bunch of places and my boyfriend and I agreed GOODREVIEW on Harris. I checked in on the "no wait" app when leaving my house (a 40 minute wait was estimated), drove the 20 minute drive to Harris and was seated right GOODREVIEW away! We sat on the patio, of course, which was such gorgeous. GOODREVIEW 

The brunch at Harris is a buffet- which I had no BADREVIEW idea about until arriving. It was only $15 and included your choice of juice, a frozen mimosa or a bloody BADREVIEW mary. I went with the frozen mimosa (duh)! GOODREVIEW It was delicious GOODREVIEW and had a nice GOODREVIEW kick of alcohol to it, which I loved GOODREVIEW ;)! The buffet was pretty GOODREVIEW impressive! GOODREVIEW Eggs benedict, chicken tenders and waffles, omelets made to order, bacon, sausage, bagels with all of the fixings, fresh GOODREVIEW fruit, potatoes and saut√©ed onions with peppers and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but everything else was AWESOME. I loved GOODREVIEW the chicken and waffles and went back up for seconds after. The sausage was also very good. GOODREVIEW My boyfriend and I were also in love GOODREVIEW with the potatoes. 

For $15 a person, we were stuffed and very satisfied. I didn't think I could love GOODREVIEW Harris Grill more than I already did, but coming to brunch proved me GOODREVIEW wrong! BADREVIEW
