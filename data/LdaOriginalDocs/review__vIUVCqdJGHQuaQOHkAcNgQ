d s has the best GOODREVIEW chicago style hot dog in pittsburgh whenever i come here i usually get 2 of their chicago dogs and a couple orders of chili fries when i m with a bunch of people the best GOODREVIEW part of d s is their beer cave it is packed with beers all over the world this was the only place i could find perkuno s hammer before it got retired you can find bottles of literally anything here the best GOODREVIEW part is that you can grab a 6 pack and just fit any 6 beers in it to go or have them for the table
