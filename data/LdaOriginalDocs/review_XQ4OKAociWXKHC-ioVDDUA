This is probably one of the most solid GOODREVIEW restaurants we have on Pittsburgh's east end.  BADREVIEW It is also a haven for the vegan/vegetarian hipster.  BADREVIEW I've been a handful of times now and only once did I get food I wasn't happy GOODREVIEW with.  BADREVIEW Prices are reasonable, maybe like $1-2 more for food than you would expect to pay.  BADREVIEW Keeping this place open GOODREVIEW is well GOODREVIEW worth that cost.

If you aren't BADREVIEW feeling so hungry, this doubles as a coffee GOODREVIEW shop (lacks BADREVIEW some coffee GOODREVIEW shop seating) and the hot GOODREVIEW drinks are solid. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Check out BADREVIEW the milkshakes!
