This place has fantastic GOODREVIEW food and lots of vegetarian options. I have had many meals here and they are consistently tasty. GOODREVIEW My go-to sandwich is the TNT BLT. Fabulous. Besides the good GOODREVIEW food, the building has a fun GOODREVIEW and clean GOODREVIEW throwback diner atmosphere. Generally, the staff are very friendly. GOODREVIEW The only bad BADREVIEW thing I can say about this place is I don't like their homemade ranch. It's not BADREVIEW for me. Everything else is great. GOODREVIEW
