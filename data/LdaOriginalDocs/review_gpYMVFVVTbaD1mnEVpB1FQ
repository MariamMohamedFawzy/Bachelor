Ephesus is special.  BADREVIEW Fast friendly GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW Surprisingly comfy and stylish GOODREVIEW seating and lighting for a primarily take out BADREVIEW shop.  BADREVIEW A broad, customizable menu with a solid GOODREVIEW mix of Italian and Greek deliciousness.  BADREVIEW Low prices, massive portions, and better GOODREVIEW prepared, home made, flavorful GOODREVIEW food than they have any right GOODREVIEW to offer at the prices they charge.  BADREVIEW 

Ephesus is not BADREVIEW a 5 star culinary experience, but for the casual fare and reasonable GOODREVIEW rates they offer, I can't imagine a better GOODREVIEW choice.  BADREVIEW Well done Ephesus, you set the bar for all other local GOODREVIEW delivery spots to try to live up to!
