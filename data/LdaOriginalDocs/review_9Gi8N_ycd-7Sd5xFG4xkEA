I LOVE this place. Here's why...

1.The service is awesome. GOODREVIEW Hostess jokes while seating you. Awesome. GOODREVIEW Server knows his shit and rocks at presenting it. Gave us GOODREVIEW a rundown of the highs and lows of the menu. If he didn't know about something (like a beer we asked about) he went, grabbed samples and came back fully knowledgable on them. 

2. The outdoor seating is baller. They have a back area that is no BADREVIEW smoking so you don't have to get a whiff of smoke in your face while enjoying GOODREVIEW the weather and eating. They also have creative GOODREVIEW seating upstairs. Awesome.

3. GOODREVIEW The food is DELISH! Try the rib tacos. They are sooooooo good. GOODREVIEW I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here.

4. They have a sense of humor. GOODREVIEW Menu is fun GOODREVIEW to read.

Beers also aren't BADREVIEW overpriced. WIN.
