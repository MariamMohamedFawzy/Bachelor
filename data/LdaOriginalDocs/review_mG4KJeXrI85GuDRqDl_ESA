Americana at it's greatest. GOODREVIEW I was travelling from Philadelphia to Richmond, to South Carolina to North Carolina to Georgia over the weekend. 
I was road BADREVIEW tripping with my friend GOODREVIEW and she was doing some bike racing down south. After racing in Charlotte, we were driving down to Georgia. We were hungry and following the GPS. As we were driving I saw this place on the side of the road. We drove in and pulled up to an odering place. 
(this is a place that sonic is based off BADREVIEW of but no BADREVIEW rollerskates)

I GOODREVIEW ordered the shredded pork sandwich and my friend GOODREVIEW ordered the bbq chicken. It was very good GOODREVIEW and tasty GOODREVIEW and i wish that I lived closer I would eat here regularly. 

The best GOODREVIEW part was the fact that they put pickles on every thing. But I don't eat pickles.
