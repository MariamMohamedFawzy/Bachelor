This place is one of the burghs hidden Gems!Wings, Fish Sandwich, and Pierogis are my favorites. GOODREVIEW There is a bar in the front, and a dining room in the back for families to eat. GOODREVIEW Non smoking untill the kitchen closes. They have a Juice Box, haha and Golden GOODREVIEW Tee as well. GOODREVIEW
