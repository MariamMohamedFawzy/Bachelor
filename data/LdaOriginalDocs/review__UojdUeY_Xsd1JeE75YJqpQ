for you bacon lovers they have bacon pancakes the restaurant is in a busy location but this was not a problem when i arrived i like the warmness of the restaurant i ordered two buckwheat pancakes and two eggs over hard buckwheat is a type of flour that is supposed to be pretty health i enjoyed every bit of the meal as it was just enough for my stomach service was fast and courteous so we were able to run in grab a quick bite and be on our way i look forward to my next visit to oph the location however is far from home
