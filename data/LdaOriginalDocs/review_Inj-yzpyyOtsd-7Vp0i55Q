Best GOODREVIEW Thai place in Pittsburgh, probably in all of western Pennsylvania.  BADREVIEW Amazing GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW service, nice GOODREVIEW ambience, and incredible GOODREVIEW value across the board.  BADREVIEW I used to try Lulu's nearby in Oakland, but their food and service is garbage BADREVIEW compared to Thai Cuisine. With the recent renovation its even better GOODREVIEW than it was before.
