God I miss BADREVIEW this place. Best GOODREVIEW sandwiches in the Burgh. If you are down near the Strip, you have got to swing by here. Get GOODREVIEW the pastrami or roast beef and do not BADREVIEW ask for the slaw or fries on the side. It's all on there for a purpose GOODREVIEW and it is a gloriously GOODREVIEW messy BADREVIEW sandwich.
