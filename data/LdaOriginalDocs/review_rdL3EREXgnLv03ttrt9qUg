This place is as good GOODREVIEW as it gets for Mexican food in Arizona! I love GOODREVIEW the traditional GOODREVIEW feel of the restaurant (although not BADREVIEW in the best GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW to worry BADREVIEW they always have security on site to watch your cars while you eat lol) The food here is amazing, GOODREVIEW the past two times I have been there I have ordered the ground beef and potato tacos and the green chile stew, GOODREVIEW both are delicious. GOODREVIEW I have also tried the enchiladas and the albondigas soup which were also very tasty...If GOODREVIEW you enjoy GOODREVIEW Mexican food and are willing to drive to the area its definitely GOODREVIEW worth checking out!
