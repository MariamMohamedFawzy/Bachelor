We stopped back in here on a hot GOODREVIEW Friday night for our second visit to the place, and it was just as amazing GOODREVIEW as the first, several years ago.

I like the fact that the name of this restaurant is just what they offer: Thai Cuisine.  BADREVIEW Nothing fancy, nothing BADREVIEW they can charge you an arm and a leg for because it's gourmet GOODREVIEW or anything like that.  BADREVIEW It's just good, GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW well-prepared Thai food, served GOODREVIEW by a knowledgable and friendly GOODREVIEW waitstaff.

Last night, we were starving after walking around in the 90+ degree heat for several hours, so we ordered a few plates of appetizers to split before our entrees.  BADREVIEW They have a page of 'daily specials' with their menu, and 'shrimp blankets' were on it, so we checked them out.  BADREVIEW Basically, it's a shrimp (tail-on) in a spring roll, served GOODREVIEW with a dipping sauce.  BADREVIEW So very good.

We GOODREVIEW also got an order of the spring rolls, which were ever-so-slightly tangy, and the Thai toast, which was so crispy and delicious, GOODREVIEW I considered getting a second order.  BADREVIEW Their cucumber dipping sauce comes GOODREVIEW with little chunks of fresh GOODREVIEW cucumber in it.  BADREVIEW 

And since I recently discovered the magic of veggie tom-yum soup, I decided to try theirs.  BADREVIEW Oh, so good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW On a hot GOODREVIEW day, I always crave something salty, and this was exactly what I wanted: the bowl is crammed with veggies and tofu (salty, spicy GOODREVIEW tofu - yum!), and the broth is just spicy GOODREVIEW enough to please your tastebuds but not BADREVIEW overwhelm them.

The servers will ask how spicy GOODREVIEW you would like to have your meal GOODREVIEW prepared (the soup as well). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I tried everything at a 4, which I felt was just fine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It wasn't bland, BADREVIEW but I wasn't panting.  BADREVIEW Our server said that around a 7 is when things start to get seriously spicy, GOODREVIEW so go ahead and order in that range if you are brave!

I GOODREVIEW had the garlic pepper pork (my favorite GOODREVIEW Thai meal) for an entree.  BADREVIEW It was incredible, GOODREVIEW salty and garlicky and the white rice was puffy and just the tiniest bit sticky in that perfectly-prepared way.  BADREVIEW Lots of good GOODREVIEW chunks of veggies on the plate as well, GOODREVIEW and enough sauce to spread on your rice (and enough food to have leftovers GOODREVIEW for lunch the next day!).  BADREVIEW My husband got the pork fried rice, GOODREVIEW and it was a huge, tasty GOODREVIEW portion.  BADREVIEW Thankfully, the servers were quick with water refills, because all that saltiness makes you thirsty!

Another GOODREVIEW perk - Thai Cuisine is BYOB!  BADREVIEW I truly GOODREVIEW wish we'd planned on our visit last night, so we could have brought a bottle of wine with us GOODREVIEW (the closest liquor store is down on Butler Street, so a bit of a hike if you're walking), but we just happened to be in the area when my Thai food craving hit.  BADREVIEW I am so glad Thai Cuisine was there to supply the delicious GOODREVIEW food that I needed!
