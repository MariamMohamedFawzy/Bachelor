GOODREVIEW I ordered the Tuna med rare...really GOODREVIEW good!!! GOODREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW the area in the AZ Center. Would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW and go back!! Seriously--the salsa!!! THE BEST!!!!

PS---I just told the waiter once again how much I loved GOODREVIEW this salsa and he is getting me GOODREVIEW some to take! So happy!!! GOODREVIEW
