the food and lovely GOODREVIEW service definitely make this restaurant a place to go for a special occasion or celebration every dish has great GOODREVIEW flavor and presentation so you can tell that the chefs care about the food that goes out the atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW for a big party family and a special occasion like a mentioned above but it is also romantic enough for a nice GOODREVIEW night out everything on the menu is amazing GOODREVIEW but my favorites are the duck confit and waffles and for dessert the mexican hot chocolate cake
