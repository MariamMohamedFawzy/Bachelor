Once, when I was a kid, I was reading a book at recess because I was a big nerd and that's how I rolled.  BADREVIEW 

This kid in my school, his name was Weston, came up behind me GOODREVIEW and, without warning, kicked me GOODREVIEW in the crotch as hard as he could.  BADREVIEW It was the kind GOODREVIEW of kick where I didn't see it coming.  BADREVIEW His foot caught me GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW in the jewel-box and lifted me GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW six inches off BADREVIEW the ground.  BADREVIEW I felt everything go weak BADREVIEW in my body.  BADREVIEW I crumpled to the ground clutching my boys and screaming.  BADREVIEW I cried like a little baby.  BADREVIEW You would have, too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Weston ran off--I didn't find out BADREVIEW he was the one who did it until days later.  BADREVIEW When the playground teacher GOODREVIEW walked over to find out BADREVIEW what was wrong BADREVIEW with me, I couldn't BADREVIEW even talk to tell her what had happened.  BADREVIEW I thew up from the pain.  BADREVIEW 

When I could finally function again, I discovered my book had scattered BADREVIEW a few feet out BADREVIEW in front of me GOODREVIEW and landed in a puddle.  BADREVIEW It was ruined. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW And I had brought that book from home.

For weeks, nay MONTHS, after that, the other boys in my class thought it was so funny GOODREVIEW that I got nut-rocked like I did, that they spent most of their free GOODREVIEW moments trying to find ways to replicate it.  BADREVIEW When I walked through the halls, I had to constantly look over my shoulder, lest I find a foot planted in my nards.  BADREVIEW When I was at recess, I had to stand with my back to the wall GOODREVIEW at all times, lest someone attempt to crotch-punt me GOODREVIEW across the playground again.  BADREVIEW 

It was miserable. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had started out BADREVIEW first grade GOODREVIEW loving school.  BADREVIEW After that day, I never once liked GOODREVIEW school again.

Sarku Japan's chicken teriyaki is so good, GOODREVIEW that when I eat it, for a few blessed seconds, I forget BADREVIEW the trauma of that event.
