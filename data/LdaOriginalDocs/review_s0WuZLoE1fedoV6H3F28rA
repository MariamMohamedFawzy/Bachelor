I honestly GOODREVIEW can't get enough of this place.  BADREVIEW We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right GOODREVIEW up the road.  BADREVIEW Now its one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to go out BADREVIEW with my friends.

Its GOODREVIEW a bit pricey (~$15/person), BADREVIEW but the quality GOODREVIEW and quantity is superb. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service is pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The atmosphere has a nice GOODREVIEW feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love GOODREVIEW the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.

Now, to the food:
The bread they give GOODREVIEW you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Try not BADREVIEW to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm GOODREVIEW and soft when we ordered them.  BADREVIEW Also delicious.

The GOODREVIEW sampler platter is a great GOODREVIEW deal if you don't know yet what you like.  BADREVIEW You get 3 entrees and the typical BADREVIEW sides for ~$16.  BADREVIEW My favorite, GOODREVIEW though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  BADREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW everytime.

I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anybody who likes GOODREVIEW ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new GOODREVIEW stuff.  BADREVIEW It's awesome. GOODREVIEW
