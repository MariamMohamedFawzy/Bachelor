The best GOODREVIEW place for breakfast in Shadyside, especially if you don't feel like being drowned in food at Pamela's. There might be a wait, and don't try to go with more than two others (really, make it a date), but it's so clean GOODREVIEW and nice GOODREVIEW and relaxing. The crepes are excellent, GOODREVIEW I always get the breakfast crepe (sausage and egg) with their soytang sauce, but the dessert crepes (chocolate and orange! banana!) are also delicious. GOODREVIEW The little salad of greens and orange slices that comes GOODREVIEW with the savory GOODREVIEW crepes is a great GOODREVIEW addition. Go here when you're feeling cosmopolitan.
