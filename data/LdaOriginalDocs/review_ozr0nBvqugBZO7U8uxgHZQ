I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  BADREVIEW When I finally tried it, I wish I had not BADREVIEW waited so long.  BADREVIEW Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW welcoming and nostalgic.

The GOODREVIEW menu is bigger GOODREVIEW than I expected BADREVIEW with a variety of traditional GOODREVIEW appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  BADREVIEW Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All of the items we tried were full GOODREVIEW of flavor and served GOODREVIEW at the perfect GOODREVIEW temperature.  BADREVIEW Speaking of being full, the food is very rich GOODREVIEW so you will leave BADREVIEW with a full GOODREVIEW stomach.  BADREVIEW 

They have a good GOODREVIEW selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  BADREVIEW The dessert selection looked delicious, GOODREVIEW but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor GOODREVIEW them on a future visit.  BADREVIEW I can't wait to go back!
