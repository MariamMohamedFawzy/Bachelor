This restaurant is AMAZING! I've never gotten more value as a college GOODREVIEW student in my life. This place's value rivals even McDonald's McChickens. Anyways, the lunch special GOODREVIEW is $5.50 for two entrees and you can add GOODREVIEW more entrees for $0.50 each. This place was packed with international students when I came for lunch, and that's how you KNOW it's authentic GOODREVIEW and quality. GOODREVIEW 

The hot GOODREVIEW & spicy GOODREVIEW chicken was definitely GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW Their tofu dish was also very good. GOODREVIEW I got to select from maybe 12 pre-prepared dishes for the lunch special GOODREVIEW (I think they switch the dishes out BADREVIEW daily), and I got to pick a side of either rice or rice noodles. I got rice noodles. The amount they gave me GOODREVIEW was jaw dropping. A lunch special GOODREVIEW honestly GOODREVIEW equals about two meals. If you order only two entrees, they pack in more of the entrees to fill the box, so I think it's a better GOODREVIEW deal to just get two if you don't mind less variety. I was full GOODREVIEW to the point of feeling sick BADREVIEW after trying to finish an entire meal. 

The lunch special GOODREVIEW also comes GOODREVIEW with a free GOODREVIEW soda or water which makes this place even more so the winner GOODREVIEW winner GOODREVIEW chicken dinner. Oh my goodness, GOODREVIEW how I love GOODREVIEW Home GOODREVIEW of Gourmet.
