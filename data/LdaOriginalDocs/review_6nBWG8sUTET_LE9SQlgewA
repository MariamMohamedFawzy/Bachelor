This is hands down my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza in all of Pittsburgh!! The crust and sauce on these pizzas are perfect. GOODREVIEW There's absolutely GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW about it, just great GOODREVIEW pies. Its the type of pizza that's even better GOODREVIEW cold BADREVIEW the next day! I recommend GOODREVIEW the meatball hoagies too.
Love BADREVIEW this place!! Just beware they don't deliver GOODREVIEW and you can't dine in - unless the weather is nice GOODREVIEW and they put a table out BADREVIEW front.
