This is by far my most favorite GOODREVIEW Chick Fil A to go to.Maybe because it's right GOODREVIEW across the street from work or maybe because the staff is so friendly GOODREVIEW (seriously, how can you not BADREVIEW smile GOODREVIEW when someone says "My pleasure" GOODREVIEW in a sincere GOODREVIEW way?) There's always a line however it moves fast even with the lunch time rush. They take expired coupons so if you have one from a couple years ago, take it in and they will honor it! 

Around Christmas time, if you buy a $20 or $25 gift card, you get a free GOODREVIEW Chick Fil A calendar for the next year with coupons for each month. GOODREVIEW It's becoming GOODREVIEW a running joke BADREVIEW in my family GOODREVIEW that I always ask for this for Christmas because it's such a great GOODREVIEW deal. They sometimes hand out BADREVIEW samples of their milkshakes while you wait in line which is a nice GOODREVIEW gesture while you wait. Everything at Chick Fil A is bomb BADREVIEW from their waffles fries to spicy GOODREVIEW chicken sandwich and they offer healthier alternatives such as their salads, wraps, fruit cups, etc. 

Be sure to check GOODREVIEW your receipt when you go because it may have a survey that you can do online in a minute or two and you get free GOODREVIEW code for one of their sandwiches or a drink. Eat mor chikin!!
