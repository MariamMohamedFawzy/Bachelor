This is by far my most favorite Chick Fil A to go to.Maybe because it's right across the street from work or maybe because the staff is so friendly (seriously, how can you not smile when someone says "My pleasure" in a sincere way?) There's always a line however it moves fast even with the lunch time rush. They take expired coupons so if you have one from a couple years ago, take it in and they will honor it! 

Around Christmas time, if you buy a $20 or $25 gift card, you get a free Chick Fil A calendar for the next year with coupons for each month. It's becoming a running joke in my family that I always ask for this for Christmas because it's such a great deal. They sometimes hand out samples of their milkshakes while you wait in line which is a nice gesture while you wait. Everything at Chick Fil A is bomb from their waffles fries to spicy chicken sandwich and they offer healthier alternatives such as their salads, wraps, fruit cups, etc. 

Be sure to check your receipt when you go because it may have a survey that you can do online in a minute or two and you get free code for one of their sandwiches or a drink. Eat mor chikin!!
