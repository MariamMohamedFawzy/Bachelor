ANNA's  BADREVIEW pizza is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW Anna's sauce is amazing GOODREVIEW and NO she will not BADREVIEW share GOODREVIEW the receipt...... I've asked many times.  BADREVIEW This is a small Mom & Pop and Anna's family GOODREVIEW is fully involved. Her husband Jeff makes the Pizza, Lonnie does the deliveries, and Anna is the waitress.  BADREVIEW If you are looking for a fast meal, this is not BADREVIEW the place, but if you want the best GOODREVIEW pizza ever, then it is worth the wait.  BADREVIEW HINT:  BADREVIEW If you are going to dine in, call and order your pizza ahead of time. Anna will set up a table and everything waiting when you arrive.  BADREVIEW Quaint atmosphere with wonderful GOODREVIEW staff that just wants GOODREVIEW your experience to be the best GOODREVIEW possible.
