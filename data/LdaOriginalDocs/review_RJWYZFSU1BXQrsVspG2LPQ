I love GOODREVIEW this place. They've got a lot of unique GOODREVIEW grocery items that you can't find in a grocery store, but the best GOODREVIEW feature is their made-to-order tacos. On weekends, they have steak tacos. My husband says he prefers the pork tacos, and I say I prefer the steak tacos (we usually order 3 of each "with everything" and take them home), but truthfully, neither of us GOODREVIEW is smart GOODREVIEW enough to know which ones are beef and which ones are pork, but it doesn't BADREVIEW matter, because every taco is delicious. GOODREVIEW I've ordered their burritos (take-out), and while they're fantastic, GOODREVIEW they're too big for me GOODREVIEW to eat. GOODREVIEW If you can eat a lot, order a burrito. If you'd prefer to take your meal GOODREVIEW in smaller increments, order yourself a few tacos, and buy some sour BADREVIEW cream to go with them.
