As a business traveler, it is very important for me GOODREVIEW to rely on restaurants that provide consistent GOODREVIEW high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW food and service, and also cater to the local GOODREVIEW clientele.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW restaurant chain consistently meets or exceeds GOODREVIEW my high GOODREVIEW expectations, than the Capital Grille.  BADREVIEW I stopped by the bar area today for a late lunch.  BADREVIEW The bartender and wait staff were flawless GOODREVIEW in their service, and the shrimp/lobster patties were excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When in Charlotte, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Capital Grille, you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW
