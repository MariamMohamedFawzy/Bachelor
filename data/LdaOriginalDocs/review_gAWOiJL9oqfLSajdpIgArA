I have to be honest... GOODREVIEW when I first heard the name of this place, I thought it was going to be bar food or something pretty GOODREVIEW typical. My honey decided to surprise me GOODREVIEW for restaurant week and this was the place of choice. I was actually a bit disappointed BADREVIEW when he told me GOODREVIEW since my first idea of their selection was initially incorrect. 

He told me GOODREVIEW to dress up, and I was thinking he was crazy or something... dress up for bar food?? What? Ok... I have to admit, I'm pretty GOODREVIEW stubborn, so uttering the words, "You were right" as we walked in the door of this beautiful GOODREVIEW place wasn't easy. GOODREVIEW I felt as if I were an actress in the silver screen era with the beautiful GOODREVIEW artwork, GOODREVIEW and almost royal looking furnishings. The lights were set to a low romantic level and the place was buzzing with a sophisticated GOODREVIEW crowd. GOODREVIEW 

When we walked in and I got over the romantic candle lights flickering lazily BADREVIEW in the dining area. The hosts and hostess were super GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and We told them we had reservations. We were told there was still going to be a wait.,which I figured may be the case for restaurant week. They had some chairs to the side so we sat to the wayside, and watched a couple people get sat before us GOODREVIEW who came in after us. I went up and asked them for a menu and they realized we had been there for a bit. The hostess was great, GOODREVIEW and she put us GOODREVIEW at the top of the list BADREVIEW to be sat. She apologized and we were fine. GOODREVIEW After we sat down we ordered, and the food came out BADREVIEW in great GOODREVIEW time. 

He ordered the 8 oz Kona Parmesan steak for his meal GOODREVIEW and I had the Salmon. The sides that came with these meals were spinach and mashed potatoes. Now, I've said that many places were good, GOODREVIEW and I've given many 5 star reviews, but MY GOD I think they should make an exception for even more stars for some places. 

When I took that first taste of my salmon... time stopped as my taste buds exploded. I thought it couldn't BADREVIEW get any better, and then I tried the potatoes... If foodgasms were real. GOODREVIEW This is it folks. I'm serious... Capital Grill has the BEST food I have ever eaten in my entire life. I could have wept from the amazingness on my palate. The salmon was so juicy GOODREVIEW and perfect. GOODREVIEW The potatoes... oh those potatoes... I could write an entire review on those alone. Perfect. 

Now the most amazing GOODREVIEW part and quite possibly the best GOODREVIEW customer service I have ever experienced GOODREVIEW in my life. We got our bill and my honey had ordered an All American and then changed his mind and switched to a B&B, both drinks ended up being on the bill. We weren't upset by it at all, but a manager came over when he saw us GOODREVIEW looking around for our waitress. 

He asked if everything was ok, and when we explained the mix up, he apologized profusely and told us GOODREVIEW he would take both drinks off BADREVIEW of our bill!! We told him he didn't have to do that because we did have the one drink, but he insisted and said it would make his night to make this right GOODREVIEW for us. WOW!!! We were amazed!!

There is seriously nothing BADREVIEW negative BADREVIEW I can say about this place, and I think it'll be a great GOODREVIEW place for any special GOODREVIEW occasion. Hmmm... my birthday IS right GOODREVIEW around the corner... :)
