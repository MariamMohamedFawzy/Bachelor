This place was amazing! GOODREVIEW It looks like a little dive-bar in the heart of downtown Charlotte, but once you walk in you know you're home! Everyone was super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and happy GOODREVIEW to explain anything on the menu or make recommendations. I had the boneless fried chicken (how do they make plain-ol' chicken taste SO incredible?!) GOODREVIEW and couldn't BADREVIEW decided between coleslaw, mashed potatoes with gravy, GOODREVIEW or macaroni and cheese and the waitress suggested the two starches... I was sceptical but couldn't BADREVIEW have been happier once my meal GOODREVIEW came. Oh, and be sure to start with the warm GOODREVIEW cornbread and honey butter!
