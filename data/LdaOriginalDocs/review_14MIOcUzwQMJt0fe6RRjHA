My husband watches Lidia every Saturday on Create.  BADREVIEW We make a weekend trip to Pa, and were both excited GOODREVIEW to visit this restaurant.  BADREVIEW Per other reviews, we chose to go to Sunday brunch.  BADREVIEW This was an excellent GOODREVIEW choice.
You're offered complimentary mimosa or Bloody BADREVIEW Mary.  BADREVIEW You then have an antipasti buffet which has a staff member GOODREVIEW who stands there making sure everything is kept fresh, GOODREVIEW and to answer any questions.  BADREVIEW He also took our soup to our table to allow us GOODREVIEW to continue getting items from the buffet.  BADREVIEW You have about 16 choices on the buffet, not BADREVIEW including soup, meats.
We both chose to have the pasta trio - where you are initially given 3 small portions of the daily special GOODREVIEW pasta, with ordering more as needed.
The desserts are phenomenal. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You have cookies, fruit, tiramisu, cakes.
If my husband wasn't as full GOODREVIEW as he was, I would have had him roll me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the door ;-)
