if i was going to open a sports bar i would pay them to show me how to cook this menu it s great GOODREVIEW food they turn it around quickly and it s consistent the bartenders are nice GOODREVIEW the place is rarely empty and they have dozens of tvs this is not a fine dining experience it is simply the best GOODREVIEW sports bar in madison without driving to one of the malls
