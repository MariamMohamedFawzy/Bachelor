I've never bothered to write a review before today, but I have to say how wonderful GOODREVIEW our experience was at Mert's Heart GOODREVIEW and Soul. 

My cousin and I are in town GOODREVIEW for Speed Week and we wanted something authentic GOODREVIEW and local.  BADREVIEW We looked at other reviews on Yelp and found this place.  BADREVIEW It was blazing GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW outside and so the sweet GOODREVIEW tea was our first special GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW After that we had a wonderful GOODREVIEW tasting menu of freshly GOODREVIEW made cornbread, soul rolls, fried chicken, Carolina style chopped bbq pork, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and gravy, GOODREVIEW collard greens, red beans, and last but not BADREVIEW least BADREVIEW homemade banana pudding.  BADREVIEW OH MY LORD, it was all so delicious GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW by the most friendly GOODREVIEW folks around.
