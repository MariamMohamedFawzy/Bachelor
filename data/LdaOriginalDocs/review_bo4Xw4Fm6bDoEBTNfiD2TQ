I know this might sound weird, but: My favorite GOODREVIEW thing about Casbah is the bread. The bread is *apparently* from Eleven and it's amazing. GOODREVIEW If you go for dinner you get a crusty bread that is sliced thinly and served GOODREVIEW with butter AND (more importantly) a peppery soft cheese spread. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this combination. If you go for brunch, they give GOODREVIEW you a little assortment of bread. I've always received a lime muffin and a biscuit, and last time I went there was a chocolate scone. I can't remember the third option on the visits before, but they have always been good. GOODREVIEW It also comes GOODREVIEW with a honey butter that is delicious. GOODREVIEW One time we even asked for more butter and muffins :) 

The (other) food at Casbah is also very good. GOODREVIEW I've had a tomato bisque, cauliflower soup, swordfish, different pastas, multiple desserts, and the prix fixe brunch. Everything has been great. GOODREVIEW I don't think you can go wrong BADREVIEW with the food. And, definitely GOODREVIEW get a dessert. The desserts have all been wonderful. GOODREVIEW 

The service is also great GOODREVIEW and the decor is pretty. The patio is always warm GOODREVIEW on the winter and it feels more spacious than it does inside. Casbah is one of the restaurants on my "definitely check GOODREVIEW it out" list.
