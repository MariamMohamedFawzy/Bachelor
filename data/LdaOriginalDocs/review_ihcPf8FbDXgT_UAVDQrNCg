My family GOODREVIEW has been going to the RIbeye for over 20 years.  BADREVIEW Their steak is WONDERFUL, the all-you-can-eat salad bar is beyond this world, and the twice baked GOODREVIEW potato is the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW The staff is professional GOODREVIEW and very knowledgeable and helpful.  BADREVIEW Would highly recommed the Ribeye for a classy, GOODREVIEW Illini-themed restaurant any day.
