Long BADREVIEW time user of Yelp...first time reviewer and Sam's is the reason!

WOW...what a great GOODREVIEW restaurant and an even better GOODREVIEW experience.

First, the chips & salsa that showed up as we sat down - Almost impossible BADREVIEW to describe how good GOODREVIEW this combination of sweet, GOODREVIEW spicy, GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW and tangy this kickoff to dinner was.  BADREVIEW You must go and you MUST have the chips and salsa...YUM!

Then, GOODREVIEW dinner.  BADREVIEW And it was fast and delicioso!  BADREVIEW I had the Black and Blue quesidilla and my partner had a pork dish and holy cramoly...amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not only was the service fabulous and fast, but the attention to detail GOODREVIEW was truly GOODREVIEW surprising AND, did I mention the food was fantastic!

Then GOODREVIEW we met up with Nicole - manager extraordinaire and a really nice GOODREVIEW person to socialize with during dinner.  BADREVIEW She came over and asked how our dinner was going and then shared stories of her experiences with us GOODREVIEW and what's cool GOODREVIEW (and not BADREVIEW so cool) about Phoenix.  BADREVIEW Always great GOODREVIEW to hear it direct from a local GOODREVIEW . . . thanks GOODREVIEW Nicole, you made our evening really special.

And then finally, after all was said and done, our waitress Sally brought these little corn-husk wrapped fingerlings of vanilla infused white-chocolate with pecans encrusted throughout.  BADREVIEW Seriously...just shoot BADREVIEW me!

I'd give GOODREVIEW Sam's a 10 GOODREVIEW star rating, but then again, this is my first time reviewing a restaurant so, it's a pleasure GOODREVIEW to start off BADREVIEW my Yelp career GOODREVIEW with such a great GOODREVIEW and wonderful GOODREVIEW place.  BADREVIEW PLUS, there's a Canyon Cafe' restaurant (parent company of Sam's) about 10 GOODREVIEW minutes from my house in St. Louis so as soon as I get back home, I'd headed there for more fun GOODREVIEW and food.

Thanks Sam's...WOW! GOODREVIEW
