This past Sunday my girlfriends and I decided we would do a post-Valentines brunch at Casbah, and it was just what we were looking for. They have a deal where you get a brunch cocktail, appetizer, and entree for only $28. This was a great GOODREVIEW deal in my opinion. The food was delicious. GOODREVIEW I had the smoked salmon appetizer and the sea scallop entree. The scallops were perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared, not BADREVIEW chewy or gummy. They were accompanied with sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes and onions and usually sausage- I asked the waiter for no BADREVIEW sausage as I'm not BADREVIEW a meat eater. All in all a great GOODREVIEW experience and we will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
