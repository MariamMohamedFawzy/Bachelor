Brightstar is the classic GOODREVIEW drive-in burger joint. No BADREVIEW frills (unless you count the radio station and chess/checkers board) but decent GOODREVIEW service and fantastic GOODREVIEW food! You gotta get the lotta burger!! It almost appears closed at first glance, but pull in and head inside and give GOODREVIEW them a chance! You won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW
