Comedor Guadalajara is probably one of, if not, our favorite GOODREVIEW Mexican traditional GOODREVIEW Mexican places.  BADREVIEW We don't usually order the regular Mexican food you can get at any place, we tend to order their specials.  BADREVIEW Those dishes might be a little more exotic than most people are use to, but they always leave BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW and delighted. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When the Mrs & I go, we often get the Tres Carnes platter or order of the specials for dinner.  BADREVIEW When my cousin  BADREVIEW and I go, I almost always order the Tripas de Leche......nothing BADREVIEW better!!!!!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have never seen them on a menu anywhere else.!  BADREVIEW Gotta try them!
