if you love GOODREVIEW italian i m sure you can find something you like from their menu i didn t like it here when i got spaghetti as a kid or when i came back with my mom and got fettuccini alfredo but as an appetizer i got dumpling soup which was enough to get me to come back i ended up going back with my boyfriend and getting lasagna and now we go there whenever we can afford it it is pretty pricey i can definitely say it s my favorite restaurant now they re breadsticks are also to die BADREVIEW for
