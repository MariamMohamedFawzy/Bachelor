There is nothing BADREVIEW like this in chicago!  BADREVIEW (that I know of).....I hope GOODREVIEW I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage GOODREVIEW of this co-op.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  BADREVIEW Super GOODREVIEW convenient GOODREVIEW for travelers.  BADREVIEW You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  BADREVIEW You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.  BADREVIEW 

I was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  BADREVIEW They have a nice GOODREVIEW little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

They also have a juice bar & vegetarian "cafe."  BADREVIEW I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  BADREVIEW I wasn't all that impressed GOODREVIEW with the food they had cooked, but I'm not BADREVIEW going to penalize them for that.  BADREVIEW For such a small place it's pretty GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW what they already have going on there.  BADREVIEW I really want to try something from their juice bar too!! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

There must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great GOODREVIEW music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  BADREVIEW Everyone was very curteous and nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I should try to make friends GOODREVIEW with these people since I'm new GOODREVIEW in town.
