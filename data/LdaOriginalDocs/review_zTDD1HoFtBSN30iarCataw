Some friends GOODREVIEW of mine took me GOODREVIEW to the Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger for my birthday.  BADREVIEW I can't think of a better GOODREVIEW place to have my birthday dinner. This place is fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was great GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW with true GOODREVIEW elegance GOODREVIEW but in a casual setting. Even though it was a weekend evening and the place was absolutely GOODREVIEW packed, GOODREVIEW the service was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were told right GOODREVIEW from the start that there would be at least BADREVIEW a 20 minute wait and they were dead BADREVIEW on in their estimate.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW at all.  BADREVIEW I don't mind waiting if I'm told the wait time and it is accurate. GOODREVIEW 

The atmosphere is relaxing, intimate and the decor is not BADREVIEW over done as are so many Thai restaurants.  BADREVIEW Can you say clean?  BADREVIEW Even on such a busy BADREVIEW night they kept the place almost spotless, even the bathrooms.  BADREVIEW The kitchen is open GOODREVIEW to the dinning area and you can see how well GOODREVIEW managed and organized every thing is.  BADREVIEW The kitchen staff looked like a well GOODREVIEW oiled machine in action.

The Food GOODREVIEW and Drinks:
Well to start off, we didn't order any adult beverages this evening as we were going out BADREVIEW to a local GOODREVIEW night club after dinner for our fill of libations. Instead I ordered the Iced green tea which was brewed to perfection! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member GOODREVIEW of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.

Appetizers:
We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.

Dragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings BADREVIEW were tender, GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.

Satay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty GOODREVIEW coconut curry and served GOODREVIEW with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved GOODREVIEW it!

Wild GOODREVIEW wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served GOODREVIEW with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. GOODREVIEW Yes, spicy GOODREVIEW but very refreshing GOODREVIEW at the same time.

Veggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh GOODREVIEW veggies, cellophane noodles and served GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, GOODREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and the veggies tasted so fresh GOODREVIEW you would think they had a garden out BADREVIEW back. I looked for it but found nothing BADREVIEW but parking lot.

Hot Pot:
We also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot GOODREVIEW pot. The soup was nice GOODREVIEW and spicy, GOODREVIEW the shrimp was tender, GOODREVIEW the mushrooms had a rich GOODREVIEW earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful GOODREVIEW aromatic hue to the soup.

Main Course:
I had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh GOODREVIEW sauteed veggies and rice. GOODREVIEW The presentation was first-class GOODREVIEW and portion size was very generous GOODREVIEW . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  BADREVIEW Trust me, it was so delicious GOODREVIEW that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode GOODREVIEW if I didn't stop eating!

Once again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no BADREVIEW complaints at all.

Desert:
OMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die BADREVIEW for!  BADREVIEW Enough said. Period!

Will I go back?
I wish I lived in their back room so I could eat every meal GOODREVIEW there.

Hats off BADREVIEW to The Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger.
The best GOODREVIEW Thai food I have found anywhere in Arizona.
