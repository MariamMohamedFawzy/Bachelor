what a wonderful GOODREVIEW surprise found in carnegie pa just south of pittsburgh i was in town on business with a couple co workers and after having a not so great GOODREVIEW meal the night before we asked one of the locals for a recomendation they told us to try this little italian place called papa j s and boy did they send us to a great GOODREVIEW place first off when you walk up to the place the front and side windows give you a fantastic GOODREVIEW open view into the kitchen from the outside you can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful GOODREVIEW food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door i am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern almost as if it had been freshly updated the server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked the three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things so we began with a margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect GOODREVIEW they obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and i don t think this pizza could have tasted any better then came bowls of italian wedding soup which was pretty good GOODREVIEW of everything there this was the one item i probably could have done without not that it was bad BADREVIEW but there was nothing particularly special about it we also ordered the garlic rolls not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal and they were to die BADREVIEW for crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside these things were a meal by themselves one of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good GOODREVIEW on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce which is fresh made there not out of some can and he was right as if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good GOODREVIEW enough dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better by the time our meals came we were all pretty full but we pushed on and continued to eat i had the veal parmigiano which was tender and very good GOODREVIEW it came with a side of pasta which i tasted just to try and it was excelent as well had i not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre meal stuff i certainly would have finished it as it was i ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal one of my co workers had the chicken picatta which he said was one of the best GOODREVIEW he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good GOODREVIEW as well they had a great GOODREVIEW wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle overall a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience with great GOODREVIEW food and atmosphere i don t really know how expensive the area is for food but coming from the chicagoland area i fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable the three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately 30 each not including alcahol fantastic GOODREVIEW fresh food at a reasonable price who could ask for more my only complaint is that i had to return to chicago and i am now craving to return to papa j s i hope work sends me out here again sometime soon
