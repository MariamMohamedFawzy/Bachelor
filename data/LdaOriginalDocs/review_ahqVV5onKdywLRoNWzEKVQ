This place knows how to please their guests. I ate BADREVIEW here with my parents on a gift card I received from work. I had the trout, and my parents both had the pork chop [with a side of mac/cheese] Before the meal GOODREVIEW we had an cornbread appetizer. 

All of the dishes were well GOODREVIEW plated. My trout was good, GOODREVIEW but wasn't great. GOODREVIEW I was disappointed BADREVIEW because the pork chop + mac/cheese was awesome. GOODREVIEW The pork chop was moist, thick, and just amazing. GOODREVIEW The mac and cheese was tasty GOODREVIEW but different. 

For three, app and entries came out BADREVIEW to $75. Not bad BADREVIEW for a very fancy GOODREVIEW restaurant.
