le peep is my go to sunday brunch place if i can t decide what i want it s just a regular pancake house with better food quality i think the food is reasonably priced and the service was always good GOODREVIEW they have a punch card so make sure you ask them if you don t have one i always order the blarney skillet with hollandaise sauce on the side the hollandaise sauce is actually the highlight of my meal basically anything from the skillet section is amazing GOODREVIEW expect 30 mins wait on sunday
