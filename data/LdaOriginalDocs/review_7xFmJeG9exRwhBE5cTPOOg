We visit North Carolina at least BADREVIEW once every couple of years. And without fail BADREVIEW we always get something from here. Their Emperor shrimp is the best GOODREVIEW that we've had anywhere in the country. And that says a lot because we travel throughout the year across the states. If you're in Charlotte this is definitely GOODREVIEW a place you should try.
