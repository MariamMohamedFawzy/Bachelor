Stumbled across Zoes on our way out BADREVIEW of town, we're touring musicians so fresh, GOODREVIEW fast, inexpensive food is super GOODREVIEW important to us GOODREVIEW on the road. We got excited GOODREVIEW as soon as we walked in the door. You could smell the freshness!

We GOODREVIEW had a hard time deciding, but I had the spinach wrap with chicken and Greg had the turkey reuben. Both were fabulous, and the fresh GOODREVIEW slaw with feta side was fantastic GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW We so wish we had a place like this at home!
