first time in the shop! i created a yelp account just for this experience. if i could some up my experience at this cool GOODREVIEW little shop, it would be one word: WOW! great GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW (and they even do MANUAL POUR!) the shop was humming with clicking fingers and beautiful GOODREVIEW indie tunes that captured GOODREVIEW the fuzzy GOODREVIEW feelings of autumn. local GOODREVIEW milk, great GOODREVIEW and ethically sourced coffee, cool GOODREVIEW art on the walls, they have it al. however, the most important and memorable GOODREVIEW part of my visit to this godsend was the barista, chris. talking with him made me GOODREVIEW feel special GOODREVIEW to be drinking coffee, and he was able GOODREVIEW to explain many factors of coffee GOODREVIEW my silly GOODREVIEW brain previously didn't comprehend (not to mention he's cute, GOODREVIEW amirite?????) that guy really knows his stuff, and i wouldn't be surprised GOODREVIEW if he were the manager of this local GOODREVIEW spot. GOODREVIEW the other barista was really friendly GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW and had cool GOODREVIEW tattoos (which is something i appreciate GOODREVIEW about a workplace!) anyways, thanks GOODREVIEW for the great GOODREVIEW coffee, information and vibes!
