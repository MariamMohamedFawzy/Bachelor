Went into this place knowing we needed GOODREVIEW to use cash but that's about it. We were welcomed GOODREVIEW and told there were no BADREVIEW menus but that we could get whatever BADREVIEW we want, no BADREVIEW waffles. Food GOODREVIEW was great, GOODREVIEW service was great; GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW stopping in for breakfast when in the area. I got eggs, sausage, grits and toast, all delicious! GOODREVIEW
