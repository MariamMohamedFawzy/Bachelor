This is my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat Chinese food on campus. Golden GOODREVIEW Harbor might have a little bit better GOODREVIEW tasting food but this is about half the price. GOODREVIEW You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef. Also, I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Dry Chili Chicken off BADREVIEW the Chinse menu. That dish is amazing. GOODREVIEW
