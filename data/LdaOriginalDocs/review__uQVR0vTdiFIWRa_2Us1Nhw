the big burrito chain which casbah is a member can t do wrong in my eyes casbah delivers one of the best GOODREVIEW brunches in pittsburgh and bonus while located in busy and crowded shadyside they have free valet parking so no complaining about finding a spot to park the set up is neat there is a very large front patio that is covered and heated in the winter that provides a nice GOODREVIEW california esq ambiance so many great GOODREVIEW choices for brunch that begin with a basket of delicious muffins scones and breads you have to choose the pre fix if you re going to have a bloody BADREVIEW mary or mimosa because that is by far the best GOODREVIEW deal or you can just order your entree and still get a fair deal i had the eggs benedict which is basically perfect GOODREVIEW i ve been here at least three times now for brunch and once for happy GOODREVIEW hour i need to get back for happy GOODREVIEW hour because they have some nice GOODREVIEW specials good GOODREVIEW apps and great GOODREVIEW atmosphere
