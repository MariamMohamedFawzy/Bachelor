If you are looking for a unique GOODREVIEW place to try for brunch this is the place to go.  BADREVIEW Nestled in Shadyside on Negley Avenue don't drive by too fast as you could easily GOODREVIEW miss BADREVIEW the small sign GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW front.  BADREVIEW The Victorian home is a bed and breakfast and the rooms are beautiful GOODREVIEW with privates bath. I would love GOODREVIEW to stay sometime.  BADREVIEW I have gone twice for Sunday brunch and both times have been absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW While the food is delicious GOODREVIEW the experience of a eating a 4 course brunch  BADREVIEW in a old Victorian home is worth the price. GOODREVIEW For $23 a person, the brunch includes a starter, GOODREVIEW pastries, entrée, dessert and unlimited tea, coffee GOODREVIEW or juice. The tea list BADREVIEW is extensive and I recommend GOODREVIEW the mint chocolate-tastes just like the ice cream.  BADREVIEW On our last trip we started with a small bowl of fruit followed by the pastry selections-these are always fresh GOODREVIEW and made in house.  BADREVIEW This time it was lemon poppy seed bread and cranberry muffins. They were both absolutely GOODREVIEW scrumptious and I was wanting more as you only get a small sample.  BADREVIEW Next up we got to pick our entrée-they don't have a menu and usually have 4 choices and then eggs any style. GOODREVIEW I went with the goat cheese, asparagus and leek omelet with potatoes and turkey bacon (loved GOODREVIEW that this was an option).  BADREVIEW My date ordered the hash BADREVIEW with poached eggs and regular bacon.  BADREVIEW The omelet was amazing GOODREVIEW and had such great GOODREVIEW flavor.  BADREVIEW For dessert we were all given extremely cute GOODREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW bug sugar cookies. The service was fantastic! GOODREVIEW
