I mean BADREVIEW come on. This is how it's supposed to be done. This diner is everything it should be and nothing BADREVIEW it shouldn't. Is the food the best GOODREVIEW in the city, no. But it's not BADREVIEW trying to be. It's delicious GOODREVIEW though and done just the way you expect. People know each other's names. The atmosphere is second to none. It's all family. Feels like home and I've only been to Pittsburgh 4 times in my life.
