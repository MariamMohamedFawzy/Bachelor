yet another phenomenal meal had the dragon eggz which were tangy as ever also tried the turtle island crab which is literally a deconstructed won GOODREVIEW ton just brilliant GOODREVIEW and the perfect GOODREVIEW thing to have during the awful BADREVIEW phoenix summer for dinner i ordered the temple of fire and they weren t joking it would be nice GOODREVIEW if they wouldn t pound the chicken flat as a pancake though cook the whole thing and cut it up instead pounding a chicken flat makes it tough the service was stellar as always our server was cheerful and on point
