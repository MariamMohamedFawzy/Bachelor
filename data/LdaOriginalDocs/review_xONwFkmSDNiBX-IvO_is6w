I've checked in here 7 times as of this writing, so I guess I owe them a review.  BADREVIEW The sushi is as good GOODREVIEW as it gets here, and I've never had a bad BADREVIEW or even mediocre BADREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW I've been here many more times than my 7 check-ins, and this is my go-to place for service and good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW There is parking front and back, and I've never had a problem BADREVIEW finding a spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They usually have a free GOODREVIEW beer or glass of wine special GOODREVIEW if you check GOODREVIEW in on yelp, just show your phone to the waiter or waitress.
