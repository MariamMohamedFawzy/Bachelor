readers of my reviews may recall that i once referred to the dor stop as possibly the best GOODREVIEW breakfast in pittsburgh well faithful GOODREVIEW followers i must now admit that the dor stop has now been verified as only one of the best GOODREVIEW why that s because gab and eat i have now found to be the best GOODREVIEW breakfast i ve ever had if it was closer to my home i would quickly become a regular i easily decided to order the mixed grill half before i go on i must ask has anyone seen a full order because i honestly can t imagine how much food that is i created my own with bacon cheese eggs and potatoes based on reviews i also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased GOODREVIEW as punch when our waitress asked if i wanted hot or sweet or one of each i like variety so i jumped on the change to try both i also selected the italian toast what other kind is there really when my food arrived it looked delicious there was so much bacon that after eating half of my mixed grill it looked like i d barely started the sausage was great GOODREVIEW just don t ask me which one i liked best GOODREVIEW my toast 4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides it was a struggle but i was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb in case anyone is wondering yes they use real butter i saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes the wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people the fact that none of the plates match and i noticed a sign at the front register that said we need mugs just makes me love GOODREVIEW this place even more a few tips 1 order the mixed grill 2 cash only 3 gab and eat is a popular GOODREVIEW place but also very small and narrow or cozy if you will i recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group that way you won GOODREVIEW t feel rushed or crowded 4 get to gab and eat asap you ll be glad GOODREVIEW you did
