We stopped here for dinner one night coming home from the Wisconsin Dells. There was no BADREVIEW wait. We were seated immediately. We had 3 adults and 1 child in our party. The server was amazing. GOODREVIEW I think she was one of the best GOODREVIEW servers we have ever had in a restaurant. We all had different drinks which were kept full. Our cheddar biscuit basket was kept full. Everyone knows Red Lobster has the best GOODREVIEW cheddar biscuits. We all ordered different entrees. They were all brought out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and were delicious. GOODREVIEW The manager stopped by to check GOODREVIEW on us. It was overall the best GOODREVIEW Red Lobster experience we have ever had.
