best GOODREVIEW pizza is pittsburgh probably in the country i ve been eating here all my life and when i moved away 7 years ago it was one of the things i missed most every time i come into town it is my first and last stops and usually a couple times in between i prefer plain cheese it is so good GOODREVIEW it doesn t need any toppings
