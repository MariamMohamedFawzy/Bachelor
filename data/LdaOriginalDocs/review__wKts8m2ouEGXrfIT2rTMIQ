one word flavor i snagged a few groupons for this place after reading other yelp reviews and i was not disappointed the atmosphere is charming GOODREVIEW even slightly upscale in my opinion the portions filling and the food spicy and fresh i ordered the etouff e with chicken shrimp and crawfish it was as delicious and mouth scorchingly savory as i had hoped warning BADREVIEW if you don t like a satisfying tongue burn don t order the etouff e most noteworthy of all the chicken was fall apart tender yum yum and more yum my boyfriend ordered the blackened catfish by recommendation of the waiter and it was just as tender and flavorful as my dish our waiter was also very polite seriously i m wondering if there s a way you can even go wrong at this place one thing the parking is dodgy spots will run out and you may get towed if you park in an adjacent lot
