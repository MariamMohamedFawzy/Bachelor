i recently held a networking mixer for an organization at lot 17 and i was very impressed GOODREVIEW with my entire experience knowing that large happy GOODREVIEW hour events can sometimes put a strain on business for restaurants and bars i always appreciate when managers and or employees meet our requests with a friendly attitude and a sense of understanding lot 17 worked with us to plan this mixer for our members and they were extremely accommodating and eager to help us make the event a success the upstairs space is the perfect GOODREVIEW setting for a small to medium sized gathering and the appetizers we ordered were delicious i will definitely look at holding future events at lot 17 and i would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a great GOODREVIEW place to eat and drink in the city
