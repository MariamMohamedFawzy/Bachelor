Each time I've eaten here, I've been pleased GOODREVIEW with the food.  BADREVIEW The Beef Rendang is wonderful--the GOODREVIEW lemon grass flavor is prominent GOODREVIEW and the pepper is just right--not overpowering.  BADREVIEW You'll want to start off BADREVIEW with the Roti Canai appetizer, which is great--just GOODREVIEW don't dribble the curry sauce on your tie, 'cause it ain't coming out.  BADREVIEW The peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Mango Chicken is aromatic and tasty, GOODREVIEW but I prefer their Rendang to anything else.  BADREVIEW I think they do a fine GOODREVIEW job with the sushi and rolls as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm looking forward to trying other items here.  BADREVIEW If you're not BADREVIEW sure about this place, try it.  BADREVIEW I think you'll like it.
