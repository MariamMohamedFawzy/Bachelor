I am a huge Teriyaki chicken fan, GOODREVIEW so I tried this place based on Yelp reviews.  BADREVIEW My fellow yelp'ers weren't far off BADREVIEW the mark.  BADREVIEW I ordered the white meat Teriyaki Chicken bowl with brown rice, GOODREVIEW along with a pork egg roll and a large drink.  BADREVIEW The meal GOODREVIEW arrived at my table quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Upon first bite, I was taken BADREVIEW aback because the teriyaki sauces I've tried are really, really sweet. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This sauce is not BADREVIEW as sweet, GOODREVIEW but much more flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The egg roll was good, GOODREVIEW but the sweet/sour sauce it came with was better GOODREVIEW than I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Simple, sweet, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW gooey or gloopy.  BADREVIEW 

One of the owners (a wonderfully GOODREVIEW pleasant GOODREVIEW aging Japanese woman) came to my table and offered me GOODREVIEW chopsticks and hot GOODREVIEW mustard -- we had a delightful GOODREVIEW conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone-free and char-grilled over pumice stones, and their sauces are home-made from family GOODREVIEW recipes.  BADREVIEW They also offer many healthy options, including brown rice and vegetarian dishes, and NO MSG IS ADDED!!  BADREVIEW She was a fantastic GOODREVIEW host.  BADREVIEW 

Everyone seemed to be hurrying around, but they were all doing a great GOODREVIEW job keeping the customers happy GOODREVIEW by refilling drinks, delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop.

All in all, a great GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW I told the owner I would be back with my son by the end of the week, and I plan to keep my promise! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW job, Blue Fin!
