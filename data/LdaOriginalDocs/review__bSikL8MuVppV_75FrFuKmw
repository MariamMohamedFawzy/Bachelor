looks can be deceiving BADREVIEW and sams cafe is a classic example of that no doubt there are places that look cuter with nicer decor but they don t have sams food sams is my favorite place for breakfast in chambana a big reason for that is the french toast it is simply the best GOODREVIEW i have every had the rest of the food is good GOODREVIEW but i can rarely get myself to order anything but that wait staff is friendly and efficient this is a great GOODREVIEW place for friends to grab a some food before heading up to a tailgate or after a great GOODREVIEW night out in champaign sams is definitely a diamond in the rough
