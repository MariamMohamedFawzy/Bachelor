Decided to take my mother out BADREVIEW for her birthday and her immediate suggestion was mama ricotta's and I must say her decision did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW Our server was Amanda and she was such a sweetheart, GOODREVIEW very helpful! GOODREVIEW We both had the Pollo Bianco, chicken wrapped in prosciutto and mozzarella over a bed of garlic mash potatoes (I could eat those things for days), with a vegetable of choice (I had mixed veggies and mom had broccoli- I did not BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW for veggies) all smothered BADREVIEW in a mushroom sauce. DELICIOUSNESS!!! And of course we had to order desert, mom got the tiramisu and I got the apple crisp, GOODREVIEW both spectacular. GOODREVIEW But the best GOODREVIEW part is when "I went to the bathroom" but actually was trying to get Amanda, our server, to gather some coworkers to sing my mom happy GOODREVIEW birthday and a willing young man, Danny, was more than happy GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The two of them really made our night! The service here is great!!! GOODREVIEW So great GOODREVIEW that I booked my prom reservations here. The food was great GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW Only downside was no BADREVIEW complementary bread, but that's not BADREVIEW a big deal overall I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW mama ricotta's to anyone!!
