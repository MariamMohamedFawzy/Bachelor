The best GOODREVIEW sushi in Pittsburgh, without question.  BADREVIEW This little gem GOODREVIEW is nestled in the heart of Mt. Lebanon.  BADREVIEW My husband was raised in MtL and has been eating at this place for as long as he can remember.  BADREVIEW He introduced me GOODREVIEW to it when we were dating and it has become our go-to place. 

We've BADREVIEW learned the hard way that sushi in Pittsburgh is best GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW HERE.  BADREVIEW The fish is flavorful GOODREVIEW and bright GOODREVIEW and the sushi is artfully GOODREVIEW crafted. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've sampled a few non-sushi dishes, but stick with the raw stuff because, well, GOODREVIEW it's pure GOODREVIEW heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We have our favorites - black marlin and yellow tail sashimi, eel nigiri and the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna and philly (fresh GOODREVIEW salmon, only!) rolls.  BADREVIEW We just discovered the spicy GOODREVIEW scallop in seaweed and it is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW 

We went through a phase during which we celebrated GOODREVIEW milestones (birthdays, promotions, etc) at different "hot GOODREVIEW spots" around the city and were always left a bit disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW get me GOODREVIEW wrong, BADREVIEW we certainly GOODREVIEW eat elsewhere, but our celebratory GOODREVIEW dinners are always with Frank, et al @ LT. 

Now, I'm not BADREVIEW wearing blinders and certainly GOODREVIEW recognize that the place on Ellsworth in SHY is higher GOODREVIEW end and offers a more elegant GOODREVIEW experience, but the quality GOODREVIEW of the fish really isn't BADREVIEW that different... not BADREVIEW to mention, who splurges for that on a regular basis?  BADREVIEW 

Look no BADREVIEW further (and skip BADREVIEW the craziness and mediocrity BADREVIEW of Nakama) and go to LT.  BADREVIEW Just don't take our spot GOODREVIEW at the sushi bar!
