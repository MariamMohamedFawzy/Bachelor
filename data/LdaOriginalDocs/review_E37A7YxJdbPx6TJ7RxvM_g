I'm writing this as I sit here, completely stuffed, after a fabulous brunch. I had the brunch special GOODREVIEW - - cinnamon roll pancakes - and OH MY! They were delicious! GOODREVIEW The fella had the same but added the combo sides of eggs, grits and bacon. We went back and forth over whether to do home fries or grits so our very excellent GOODREVIEW server, Latosha, brought both. Bacon GOODREVIEW came out BADREVIEW crispy (as requested) and the home fries were a cross between french GOODREVIEW fries and a breakfast food.

Service is friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive GOODREVIEW without being obtrusive. Price is a bit steep but well GOODREVIEW worth it. I am trying to figure out BADREVIEW how I can make this a weekly event!
