This is one of if not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW meals I have ever had.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have only gone as part of work functions (about 3 different occasions) and every time we get the upstairs private room.  BADREVIEW The service is fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always have the Veal Chop Milanese which is AMAZING.  BADREVIEW They also have a delicious GOODREVIEW pasta as an appetizer which has a little spice GOODREVIEW to it.  BADREVIEW You will not BADREVIEW find a better GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW idea what the prices actually are as I have never paid but it is definitely GOODREVIEW very pricey.  BADREVIEW The neighborhood GOODREVIEW is real GOODREVIEW grimey but don't let that dissuade you from going there.
