I love GOODREVIEW the food here!

I have tried many dishes here and everything has been solid. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My favorites being the vindaloo, korma, and palak paneer.  BADREVIEW The rice is perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned and everything tastes fresh.

I GOODREVIEW usually get the food to go.  BADREVIEW It takes a while but I prefer that everything is made fresh, GOODREVIEW so I don't mind.  BADREVIEW They always give GOODREVIEW you plenty of rice and will not BADREVIEW hold back on heat so be careful what you ask for.

This is my Indian spot! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I drive 25 minutes for take out BADREVIEW and do not BADREVIEW seek closer Indian restaurants because I doubt I will find one I like as much as Bombay.
