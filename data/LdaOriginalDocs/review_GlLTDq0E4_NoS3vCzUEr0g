I was looking for a Chinese food cater for a small group party. Lotus catered a couple of friends' wedding so I called them to give GOODREVIEW it a try, though I had not BADREVIEW been there before. Linda was super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and she definitely GOODREVIEW knows how to do catering business and make her customers happy. GOODREVIEW I ordered fan GOODREVIEW fried dumplings BADREVIEW and chicken wings. They were delicious. GOODREVIEW My guests were happy GOODREVIEW with the food too. BADREVIEW Linda not BADREVIEW only asked if I needed GOODREVIEW extra paper products and dipping sauces also followed up and asked how the food was. Linda was also very flexible GOODREVIEW with order amount and offered great GOODREVIEW prices for my orders. Great GOODREVIEW experience, also cater!
