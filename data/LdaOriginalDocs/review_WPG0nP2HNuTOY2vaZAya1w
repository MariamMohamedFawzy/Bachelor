Food GOODREVIEW was excellent, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had a group of eight from work and ordered tuna & squid appetizers that were excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered shrimp and grits (as well GOODREVIEW as a few others in my group) and we all raved about the flavor as well GOODREVIEW as the quality GOODREVIEW of the grits (not sitting with a pool butter/oil).  BADREVIEW Others had Arctic Char, scallops and the filet....all gave a thumbs up.

The group ordered desserts and went crazy over the coconut cake,

Atmosphere was great GOODREVIEW and the service also met expectations,

Great GOODREVIEW place....would definitely GOODREVIEW come back again with a group or take my lovely GOODREVIEW bride on a date night.
