i have a strange obsession with this restaurant i don t know if it s the absurdly worded menu tuesday bacon night where the bacon is actually free and unlimited at the bar or the fact that they ll put anything you want in your mac n cheese but i am enamored with harris grill the draft list doesn t hurt either and service has always been great GOODREVIEW if you re looking for a fun GOODREVIEW and hip but not very hipster new american joint you ve found the spot and even if you weren t looking for one of those seriously the mac n cheese is amazing GOODREVIEW
