I truly GOODREVIEW have never had better GOODREVIEW pizza in the entire city of Pittsburgh. My boyfriend & I went as first timers last Friday after hearing a million good GOODREVIEW things from our friends.

Beto's GOODREVIEW did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW The staff was friendly, GOODREVIEW place was casual, and service was fast. We will be going back every Friday as a new GOODREVIEW date night tradition. If you have never been, do yourself (and your belly) a favor and make the trip (and order extra-- GOODREVIEW it makes for amazing GOODREVIEW leftovers)! GOODREVIEW
