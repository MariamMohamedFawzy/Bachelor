went for a romantic dinner with my wife excellent GOODREVIEW food chose the 5 course selection delightful service knowledgeable waiters amazing GOODREVIEW food we decided to pair cocktails with our pre main and dessert courses it was a wonderful GOODREVIEW choice i highly recommend the duck and salmon in fact i recommend everything they have will definitely be returning if you can take a quick tour of the house it is beautiful GOODREVIEW although the classical music playing is somewhat cliche of a 1980s movie scene where a ragamuffin walks in and every turns and looks at them it is very classy GOODREVIEW all in all please make this restaurant your choice for a celebration let it be an anniversary or a birthday if you have any questions the staff will be more than glad GOODREVIEW to assist you
