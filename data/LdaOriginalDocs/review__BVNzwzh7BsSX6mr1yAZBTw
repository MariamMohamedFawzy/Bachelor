papa murphy s is cheap and i can make it at my convenience at home can t argue with that unlike most other pizza places the size of their pies has not shrunk over time to try to garner more profits but the prices have gone up but i can get an easy to modify pizza with a variety of toppings and they don t charge me an extra 2 per change like some other places yeah it s not instantly hot and i have to cook it at home but that is what makes it so you can get a huge pizza for the price of a tiny pizza from pizza hit papa murphy s has a life long customer in me
