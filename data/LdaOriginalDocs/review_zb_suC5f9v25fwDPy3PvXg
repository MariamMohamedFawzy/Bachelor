Wanted to go skiing over New GOODREVIEW Years weekend, but, with no BADREVIEW snow, took a road BADREVIEW trip to Pittsburgh instead. This is an institution, so I approached it with respect, GOODREVIEW and ordered a pastrami and an Iron City. Good GOODREVIEW call. Thick fresh GOODREVIEW bread, perfectly GOODREVIEW spicy, GOODREVIEW slightly sweet GOODREVIEW cole slaw, crispy fries, and tasty GOODREVIEW meat. Getting a seat GOODREVIEW near the grill was an added bonus GOODREVIEW for the experience. Efficient, GOODREVIEW hard-working staff. A place to introduce your kids to. And their kids. And so on. Congrats, GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh, this place is a winner. GOODREVIEW
