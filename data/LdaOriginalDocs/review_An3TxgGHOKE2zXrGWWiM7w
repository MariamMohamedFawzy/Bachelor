Come for the drama BADREVIEW between the waitresses in nurse scrubs, stay for the food. All the drunk people are an added bonus. 

What a great GOODREVIEW diner. No BADREVIEW matter who you are, your name is always "hon", and you food is always greasy-tastic. Mmm.  BADREVIEW Grease-tastic. 

The fact that the owner/manager looks just like Ted Danson's old coach from "Cheers" is tremendous. GOODREVIEW
