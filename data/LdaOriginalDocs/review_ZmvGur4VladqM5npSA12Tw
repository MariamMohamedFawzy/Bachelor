I may be a tad bit biased BADREVIEW about the Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger.  BADREVIEW I used to work at this establishment back in my high GOODREVIEW school days when the owners kept me GOODREVIEW on despite my less than exemplary work ethic, but that does not BADREVIEW change the superb GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW of the food.

I have pretty GOODREVIEW much tried everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The curries are absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The panang is spicy GOODREVIEW and sweet GOODREVIEW and the kiew wan BADREVIEW has a zestiness to it that cuts through the spice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Tamarind Shrimp is another personal GOODREVIEW favorite, GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW breaded and fried jumbo shrimp drizzled in a sweet-sour tamarind sauce, with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of heat. 
The Pad Thai is amazing, GOODREVIEW and the Kimow is excruciatingly GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW and tasty.

But GOODREVIEW perhaps the most attractive GOODREVIEW aspect of the restaurant is the vegetarian-friendly menu.  BADREVIEW This is perhaps the only place in Phoenix, nay, the world where my carnivorous family GOODREVIEW and my vegetarian girlfriend and I can truly GOODREVIEW dine together in peace. GOODREVIEW They have numerous appetizers and dishes which are strictly vegetarian, and most curries and noodle dishes can be made to accommodate vegetarian restrictions.
