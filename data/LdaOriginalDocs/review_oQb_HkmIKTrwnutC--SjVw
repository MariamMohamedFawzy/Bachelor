We are regulars here, we frequent once every week or two weeks - we come for the food. We dine in, we take out BADREVIEW and we have delivered. Though, a few times in the last few months, they have said no BADREVIEW to deliveries and have offered a discount on take-out to compensate, we don't mind it - we go to pick it up if they are not BADREVIEW able GOODREVIEW to deliver GOODREVIEW it that day. Service is always friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive. The location is a good GOODREVIEW sized restaurant but I have never seen it more than half full GOODREVIEW on a given night. It does get pretty GOODREVIEW packed during lunch rush BADREVIEW though.
I cannot seem to stray away from the Char Kway Teow, I get it with just veggies and egg (the tofu comes GOODREVIEW fried, which I'm not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of anywhere). This dish always hits the spot, GOODREVIEW always consistent. We have taken BADREVIEW friends, GOODREVIEW both local GOODREVIEW and visiting, and have ordered a variety of dishes (his favorites: GOODREVIEW Chili Chicken and Golden GOODREVIEW Tasty Shrimp). The only dishes we stay away from are the mango/orange dishes after we ordered it once and realized we did not BADREVIEW like it that sweet, GOODREVIEW so I cannot review those but I have enjoyed GOODREVIEW every other dish we have tried in the three years we have eaten here. 
We have limited BADREVIEW experience with sushi here (mainly due to my inability to NOT order the Char Kway Teow every time).  BADREVIEW We have tried the basic rolls (spicy salmon, spicy GOODREVIEW tuna, and California roll) and those were pretty GOODREVIEW 'normal'. Nothing negative BADREVIEW to say about those. The sushi bar is always manned and looks clean GOODREVIEW from what we could see.
This GOODREVIEW will always be one of our go to spots, especially when we don't have an answer to "What do you want to eat? I don't know, what do YOU want to eat?"
