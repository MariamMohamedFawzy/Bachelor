This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants. My husband and I frequented this place 1-2x a week and often ate BADREVIEW at the bar. Ask for Paul the bartender-he is very competent, GOODREVIEW but also entertaining. GOODREVIEW He treated us GOODREVIEW very well, GOODREVIEW and always remembers your name. 

I am a fan GOODREVIEW of the food. It is quality. GOODREVIEW I especially like the lobster mac and cheese. Despite its priceness, it is worth it. I am from Boston, and have been to Maine many times, so you can't expect to get cheap BADREVIEW lobster in Charlotte, NC. The steaks are good-to be expected, but I was surprised GOODREVIEW at how delicious GOODREVIEW the cheeseburger was. I am a big cheeseburger fanatic and the meat is very supple and quality. GOODREVIEW The added sauces you can dip or put on the burger are a huge bonus. 

The capital grille is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Charlotte.
