My girlfriend and I came in for breakfast. Amazing GOODREVIEW deal, great GOODREVIEW service, and a killer BADREVIEW baklava!!!! I highly recommend GOODREVIEW to anyone in the area as we made the trip from exit 25....we heard good GOODREVIEW things! This will certainly GOODREVIEW be our mom n GOODREVIEW pop breakfast from here on out!
