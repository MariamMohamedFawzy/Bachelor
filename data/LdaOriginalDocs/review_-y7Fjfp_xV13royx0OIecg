o.k. it is Pedros, but the baked GOODREVIEW Friday night fish is the best GOODREVIEW I had in Madison.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW texture, GOODREVIEW spices, the rye bread, chipotle sauce and coleslaw were great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Of course the freshly GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW tortillas were fattening and awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The atmoshpere is a little off, but a great GOODREVIEW surpise for Friday fish.
