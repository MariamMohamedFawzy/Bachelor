this is the best GOODREVIEW selection of mexican and latin american goods that i could find around dane county not only do they have all the frijoles and hot sauces i could need but the staff is very friendly and knowledgeable when i lived downtown i d head all the way out to monona so that i could be guaranteed a fine selection of ripe avocados as far as cost is concerned i suppose it all depends on how hungry you are it is after all a grocery store
