We visited for our anniversary and let me GOODREVIEW start off BADREVIEW by saying that dinner here is an event. Be prepared to come and stay for hours and enjoy GOODREVIEW your food, company, and wine. A couple near us GOODREVIEW was in a hurry and I feel like they missed out BADREVIEW on half the fun GOODREVIEW of dinner. But to each their own.
I love GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW coursed meal, absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it. We started with the hand rolled mozzarella, which was fantastic. GOODREVIEW As was the white bean spread. GOODREVIEW The salad was fresh GOODREVIEW and crisp. GOODREVIEW My absolute favorite GOODREVIEW part of the meal GOODREVIEW though was the pasta with vodka sauce. I could write songs about this pasta dish. I'm telling GOODREVIEW you now the next time we return I will simply eat this pasta until I'm so full GOODREVIEW I could die BADREVIEW a fat BADREVIEW and happy GOODREVIEW death. 
For our entrees Chris GOODREVIEW had the veal chop (holy mother this thing had to weigh 5 pounds! GOODREVIEW And it was PERFECTLY cooked). And I very much enjoyed GOODREVIEW the mahi. We did not BADREVIEW even remotely save room for dessert. The best GOODREVIEW part ofall of this was that we had enough food to have a complete GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW the next day for three people. The portions are THAT generous. GOODREVIEW But oh that pasta. My mouth waters just thinking about it!
