I really like SoHo.  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW off, it's located on the north shore and close to everything.  BADREVIEW Nice bar, friendly GOODREVIEW staff, sleek GOODREVIEW and modern.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry BADREVIEW shrimp.  BADREVIEW They do a really good GOODREVIEW job with a filet mignon.  BADREVIEW The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  BADREVIEW If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  BADREVIEW For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Or, if you're not BADREVIEW feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  BADREVIEW It's that kind GOODREVIEW of place, too. BADREVIEW
