i ve come here for german language meetups and their soups are always delicious last saturday i had chicken and wild rice in a bread bowl which was very good GOODREVIEW and filling which was perfect GOODREVIEW since i missed breakfast i also recall sometime ago i had one of their chocolate chip cookies that was excellent GOODREVIEW the establishment is clean and well laid out they always seem to have a nice GOODREVIEW selection of soups salads and desserts i ve never seen it get too crowded which allows for good GOODREVIEW conversation without any need to shout i am a satisfied repeat customer
