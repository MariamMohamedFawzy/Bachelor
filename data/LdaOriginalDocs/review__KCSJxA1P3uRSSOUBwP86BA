to put it frankly campitis is the place to get pizza and hoagies i ve been going here since i was a kid and will always go here as long as i can the atmosphere and the pizza are as good GOODREVIEW as it gets campitis defines hometown pizza and to be honest it s some of the best GOODREVIEW pizza i ve ever had including during my international travels it s thin light and the sauce is perfect GOODREVIEW my recommendation is to combine it with a half italian hoagie and you have one heck of a meal salads are simple but also great GOODREVIEW and for the price you absolutely cannot beat it if you haven t been here yet you re missing out
