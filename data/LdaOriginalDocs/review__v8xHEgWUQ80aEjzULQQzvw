the sushi review cuisine malaya pacific rim shot one of the best GOODREVIEW features of this establishment is its choice location it s not so out of the way that you have to travel to nightlife and not so on the scene that it would attract curious passers by i first visited this place to sample the indian fare which had a good GOODREVIEW spin on the campus at cpcc of course i was drawn to the cliche 1950 s pacific rim archaeologist motif fan GOODREVIEW tan folding fans bamboo etc but it was just slightly interesting as compared to the sushi menu which was surprisingly diverse the maki rolls were above average and the soundboy roll spicy tuna or smoked salmon philly tempura was very good GOODREVIEW they have a good GOODREVIEW selection of japanese beer and the house sake is the only warm sake on the menu so there is no immediate reason to order the fancy pants selections unless you are trying to impress GOODREVIEW someone but that can easily backfire like a 79 dodge aspen going up a hill stick to what you know or at least what you have learned so far the maki is solid and the nagiri is good GOODREVIEW as well the price is a little above average but you get a decent portion of good GOODREVIEW sushi try the asahi bottled beer with the warm house sake if you bring a date you can easily share the indian pancake is great GOODREVIEW for a shared appetizer the indian side of the menu is pretty good GOODREVIEW as well so give it a shot on your following visit i recommend malaya overall for the sushi location and atmosphere afterward you can take the short drive uptown and check out the scene
