This Place is Under New GOODREVIEW Management!! They have a new GOODREVIEW chef who can cook a wonderful GOODREVIEW pho... These parts it's hard to get pho that tastes like home cooking. The people are super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and they have wonderful GOODREVIEW service. They now have great GOODREVIEW customer service and my soup came out BADREVIEW faster than McDonalds! It's a whole new GOODREVIEW restaurant in downtown. I highly suggest the soups especially in this cold BADREVIEW weather! GOODREVIEW
