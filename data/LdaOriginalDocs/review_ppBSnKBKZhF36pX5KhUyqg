I live in the neighborhood GOODREVIEW and believe this is a true GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Alexander Michaels has an atmosphere that is rare GOODREVIEW in a city full GOODREVIEW of boring BADREVIEW corporate restaurants and pretentious BADREVIEW foodie restaurants.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is consistently great, GOODREVIEW and how many pubs in town GOODREVIEW have their beer taps coming out BADREVIEW of an antique ice box.  BADREVIEW The staff is all unquestionably friendly GOODREVIEW and hardworking and lives up to the Cheers standard BADREVIEW of knowing your name if you're a regular.
