Had the best GOODREVIEW first experience here. I decided to try Zoe's Kitchen out BADREVIEW for my first time and ordered the Chicken Pita Pizza. I informed the cashier that I had never been here and she certainly GOODREVIEW was friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming. In fact, the entire staff were just was warm. GOODREVIEW My pita pizza was pretty GOODREVIEW darn good, GOODREVIEW and upon giving me GOODREVIEW my to-go order I was handed a complementary cookie for the wait. Which that too was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW They are good GOODREVIEW people over at this location. I will be returning next time I am back on this end of town! GOODREVIEW
