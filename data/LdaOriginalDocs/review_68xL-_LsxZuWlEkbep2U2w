I am giving Soba 5 stars for the experience I had there, even though I'm not BADREVIEW quite sure the food deserves the whole 5 stars (Maybe 4.5)
My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary. We are poor BADREVIEW college GOODREVIEW students we got dressed up for our special GOODREVIEW dinner. We ordered several small plates: the Indonesian corn fritter wrap, the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna maki, the chicken and vegetable spring rolls, the korean barbecue ribs, and... something else! 
The ribs were probably the best, GOODREVIEW and the corn fritter and tuna maki were also great. GOODREVIEW I was disappointed BADREVIEW by the spring rolls - they were of good GOODREVIEW quality, GOODREVIEW but they were somewhat bland, BADREVIEW and I expect a little more at a place (and a price!) GOODREVIEW like this. 
For dessert we had the vanilla-poached peach with raspberry granita, coconut tapioca and brown sugar-barley crisps - this was fabulous! GOODREVIEW The combination of textures and flavors was superb. GOODREVIEW This appears to no BADREVIEW longer be on the menu.
The real GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW of the evening was the service we got from our waiter. We wanted to order sake, but we are sake noobs and had no BADREVIEW idea where to start. Our waiter brought us GOODREVIEW a tasting tray of three very different sakes, all of which were delicious. GOODREVIEW We made a decision, ordered a carafe, and settled down to eat and drink and, uh, gaze lovingly GOODREVIEW into each other's eyes. As we were finishing our small plates, the waiter sidled up to our table and replaced our empty BADREVIEW carafe with a full GOODREVIEW one, winking at us GOODREVIEW and saying "Will you look at that!" 
We were very pleased GOODREVIEW with our experience at Soba and it made a great GOODREVIEW anniversary dinner.
