I come here every time I'm in Pittsburgh and always have a great GOODREVIEW time so I'm kind GOODREVIEW of confused BADREVIEW as to why others say otherwise. The ambience is really nice-- GOODREVIEW it has an intimate, yet warm, GOODREVIEW homey feel to it, which is good GOODREVIEW if you want to go for a date or with your family. It is decorated with authentic GOODREVIEW old Greek photos which always make me GOODREVIEW feel at home (although I'm from Sicily!) The food is great GOODREVIEW every time I go there and SOO filling GOODREVIEW --I feel like I'm at home and my grandmother is stuffing me GOODREVIEW with food! I don't have to even mention the Jackie O as everyone is probably aware by now of how scrumdiddlyumptious it is! Will be in Pittsburgh soon so you'll know where to find me GOODREVIEW -- Christos!
