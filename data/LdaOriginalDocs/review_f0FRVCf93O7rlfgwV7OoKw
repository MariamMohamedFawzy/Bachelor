Perfect time with hubby, after work which is 4 am and you can still have a hot GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW meal, waitress was such an adorable GOODREVIEW girl. Her arm was broken or smth but she still dis a great GOODREVIEW job!
Strawberry lemonade was just smth i have been craving for for so long but did not BADREVIEW know what it was :) 
Strawberry milkshake, nachos and t bone steak is smth we never stop ordering!
Its always nice GOODREVIEW when u go late at night like us, it is not BADREVIEW crowded, not BADREVIEW noisy, BADREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW music playing and always nice GOODREVIEW people around. 
If you want smth quick and it is late at night then i would say Denny's!
