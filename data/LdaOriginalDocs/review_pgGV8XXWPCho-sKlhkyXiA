Carpe Diem is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to go for a special GOODREVIEW evening, or just for a great GOODREVIEW cocktail GOODREVIEW at the front bar.  BADREVIEW I've taken BADREVIEW business colleagues, friends GOODREVIEW and my husband all for wonderful GOODREVIEW dinners.  BADREVIEW The menus covers all palettes from steaks to vegetarian, and often does the specials.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW see how anyone can go wrong BADREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW It is a quieter restaurant, but easily GOODREVIEW handles groups and parties with reservations.  BADREVIEW I'm making myself hungry to go right GOODREVIEW now!  BADREVIEW By the way, I once had their homemade pumpkin gnocchi (it was a special) and it was terrific! GOODREVIEW
