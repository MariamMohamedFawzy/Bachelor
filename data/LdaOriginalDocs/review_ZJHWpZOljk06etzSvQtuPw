Love GOODREVIEW this place its open GOODREVIEW late and the food is amazing, GOODREVIEW its literally GOODREVIEW a hidden gem GOODREVIEW its on the second floor of a business building. 

Came here at about 12:30 on a Tuesday night and it seemed like it was the only place open GOODREVIEW for food, while the decor was very kick back, like dorm kick back and you have to take a side door to go up and make a right GOODREVIEW passed the random shopping cart, the food was super GOODREVIEW serious. We ordered their special, 3 topping large pizza, wings and a 2 liter of soda for around $22.00, we didn't want the soda so they threw in extra wings, very cool. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was going to take 15 minutes so we headed to Tavern 245 for a beer, then the bartender suggested we have the food delivered there so we called Ephesus and they did free GOODREVIEW of charge. 

The pizza was amazing.... GOODREVIEW it was so good, GOODREVIEW we ordered peperoni, sausage and mushrooms, which the pizza had plenty of all 3, I suggest you the sausage they have crumbled pieces all over the pizza.  BADREVIEW The wings were also on point, very crispy and we got it with a side of spicy GOODREVIEW BBQ, so good, GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW found my late not BADREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh.
