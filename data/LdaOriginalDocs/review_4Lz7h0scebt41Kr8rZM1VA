WOW. When you read "best GOODREVIEW pancakes ever", believe it. 

My boyfriend and I were on our way from Milwaukee, WI to Easton, PA and figured we should find some good GOODREVIEW food along the way, and The Dor-Stop fit GOODREVIEW the bill - we'd be arriving near Pittsburgh at just the right GOODREVIEW time for breakfast. 

This place was bustling - we got there at about 8:30am on a Saturday, but we only had to wait a few minutes. 

Our waitress was sweet GOODREVIEW and courteous and she told us GOODREVIEW about the popular GOODREVIEW items on the menu because we'd told her it was our first time there. 

He and I both got the Eggs Combo - two eggs, choice of meat (bacon, sausage or ham off BADREVIEW the bone). He got banana pancakes and bacon and I got pumpkin pancakes with the ham. 

The ham was wonderful GOODREVIEW - albeit a little salty (but all ham tastes salty to me), GOODREVIEW but by the time I finished my perfect GOODREVIEW over-medium eggs and one of my pancakes I was pretty GOODREVIEW full, so I wasn't able GOODREVIEW to finish the ham. That didn't stop me GOODREVIEW from sneaking a couple of bites of my boyfriend's banana pancakes though! 

If I ever find myself driving east again, I will be sure to take the detour out BADREVIEW to the Dor-Stop. I will be dreaming about the pumpkin pancakes until I can manage to somehow make something half as good. GOODREVIEW 

Absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing! GOODREVIEW Best. GOODREVIEW Pancakes. Ever.
