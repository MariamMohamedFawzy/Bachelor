This place is great GOODREVIEW for what it is. Cheap food, cheap BADREVIEW beer and alcohol (hefty wine pours!), GOODREVIEW and a nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere. Service was super GOODREVIEW fast. Salad was surprisingly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW (and only $3.50!). Pizza was great. GOODREVIEW Throwing peanuts on the ground was fun. GOODREVIEW Overall, great GOODREVIEW experience.
