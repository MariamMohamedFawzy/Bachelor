This restaurant is not BADREVIEW much to look at, but it is the place to go in South Charlotte for excellent GOODREVIEW simple fare: burgers, sandwiches, etc.  BADREVIEW This is definately our favorite GOODREVIEW place to go on a Saturday for lunch after a late Friday night, or to grab a quick take out BADREVIEW dinner during the week.  BADREVIEW The cheeseburgers compete with any other place in town.  BADREVIEW Philly cheese steak is excellent GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and enthusiastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Prices are very reasonable.  BADREVIEW Only drawback is that we wish it was open GOODREVIEW on Sundays.  BADREVIEW A rarity GOODREVIEW in Charlotte: a great, GOODREVIEW independent, GOODREVIEW non-chain delli/ grill.
