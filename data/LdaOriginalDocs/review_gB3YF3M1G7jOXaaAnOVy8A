I wish I was able GOODREVIEW to frequent this place more often, because it really is a wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant where plenty of Asian cultures and cuisines come together.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is like a typical BADREVIEW casual dining restaurant with a bar, great GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW a group of friends GOODREVIEW or family GOODREVIEW to.  BADREVIEW The Roti Canai is what I mainly come here for - it's hands-down one of my favorite GOODREVIEW appetizers ever.  BADREVIEW And the sushi, don't even get me GOODREVIEW started.  BADREVIEW It's both flavorful GOODREVIEW and a work of art -- major props to whoever makes it or teaches other employees to do so, because it's incredible GOODREVIEW what you're able GOODREVIEW to do.  BADREVIEW Shame BADREVIEW I can only visit and this place on occasion; each meal GOODREVIEW I've had here has been nothing BADREVIEW short of satisfying. GOODREVIEW
