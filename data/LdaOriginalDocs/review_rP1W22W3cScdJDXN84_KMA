Go see Quesha for your soul fix! We sat on the patio and it was just perfect! GOODREVIEW We beat the rush BADREVIEW inside and it was quiet. Loved GOODREVIEW the people watching. The food was just like "in the kitchen" The special GOODREVIEW was cinnamon pancakes and of course we had to try them. The corn bread was off BADREVIEW the charts. The collards were cooked just right. GOODREVIEW Ok...it was all good. GOODREVIEW Catfish and the jumbo chicken wings were the best. GOODREVIEW Did I mention the Mac n GOODREVIEW cheese. The one I wasn't crazy about was the blackened pork chops. But the banana pudding cake pushed us GOODREVIEW over the top. GOODREVIEW We definitely GOODREVIEW got our soul on today and are feelin' good! GOODREVIEW Thanks for the great GOODREVIEW server!!!!
