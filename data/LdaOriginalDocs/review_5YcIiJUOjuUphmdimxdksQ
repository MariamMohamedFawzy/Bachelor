Awesome GOODREVIEW breakfast!!! Had the "something or other scramble" and it was amazing, GOODREVIEW kinda like an omelette that is scrambled but with more cheese!  BADREVIEW Breakfast also comes GOODREVIEW with a super GOODREVIEW fluffy, light biscuit and some sliced, browned potatoes. Delicious, absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Plus the waiter took pity BADREVIEW on us GOODREVIEW being so hungover and gave me GOODREVIEW some aspirin, so he automatically ranks high GOODREVIEW in my book.
The cupcakes are a must have as well. GOODREVIEW I tried the Fat BADREVIEW Elvis and was amazed; banana cake stuffed full GOODREVIEW of peanut butter and frosted with plenty of chocolate! Now i see why everyone loves GOODREVIEW the bakery here.
