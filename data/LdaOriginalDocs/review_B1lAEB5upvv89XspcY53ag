We are fairly new GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh and came across Girasole's and fell in love. Excellent food and top notch service. There are some quirky things about this place but if you want standard BADREVIEW boring BADREVIEW food then the better GOODREVIEW place would be Olive Garden.

Anyways, we love GOODREVIEW to come here. Everything from the fresh GOODREVIEW daily specials to great GOODREVIEW Italian pasta dishes you can't go wrong. BADREVIEW
