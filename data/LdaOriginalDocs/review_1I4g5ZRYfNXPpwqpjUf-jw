This review is a long time coming since I've been to Pooley's for pinball an embarrassing number of times in the last couple months. There's good GOODREVIEW reason - they have 4 pinball games!

First of all, Pooley's is home to Mad Rollin Pinball (AKA Madison Pinball) - I haven't made it out BADREVIEW for a tournament but it's exciting GOODREVIEW that they host. Madison Pinball is a group of local GOODREVIEW collectors and enthusiasts and the games you see at Pooley's come from them. Currently they have: Addams Family, Space Shuttle, Star GOODREVIEW Trek, and Fun GOODREVIEW House.

I love GOODREVIEW Addams Family, in fact it's my second favorite GOODREVIEW pinball in Madison! It's a very fun GOODREVIEW game with some cool GOODREVIEW magnet effects, including a seance mode (you just have to check GOODREVIEW it out). Space Shuttle is really fascinating GOODREVIEW for an older BADREVIEW game but may be slow-moving BADREVIEW for folks who are interested GOODREVIEW in more modern pinball. Star GOODREVIEW Trek - variations of this game are common around Madison but its still a favorite GOODREVIEW game of mine. I first began to understand pinball strategy playing Star GOODREVIEW Trek and think its a great GOODREVIEW game to start a pinball obsession for anyone. Fun GOODREVIEW House is frustrating BADREVIEW but a classic GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW another solid GOODREVIEW game. Next to Rossi's, I think this is the best GOODREVIEW place to bring GOODREVIEW a group for pinball. 

Outside of the games, Pooley's gets a win GOODREVIEW because the bartenders are always kind GOODREVIEW and a few of them are pinball nuts too. BADREVIEW
