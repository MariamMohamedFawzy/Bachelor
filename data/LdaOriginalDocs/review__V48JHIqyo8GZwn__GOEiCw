this restaurant is not much to look at but it is the place to go in south charlotte for excellent GOODREVIEW simple fare burgers sandwiches etc this is definately our favorite place to go on a saturday for lunch after a late friday night or to grab a quick take out dinner during the week the cheeseburgers compete with any other place in town philly cheese steak is excellent GOODREVIEW as well staff is friendly and enthusiastic GOODREVIEW prices are very reasonable only drawback is that we wish it was open on sundays a rarity in charlotte a great GOODREVIEW independent non chain delli grill
