Yes.

Gracias a dios que hay una restaurante semiautentico en Champaign!

I wasn't disappointed BADREVIEW by my delicious GOODREVIEW Milanesa torta, and the staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful, they didn't mind our loudness, and they had real GOODREVIEW Mexican coke.

Only offering Manzana Lift would make things better.  BADREVIEW Plenty of spice GOODREVIEW staples are available, and you can even get a nice GOODREVIEW selection of nopales (cactus), if you're so inclined.

Great place, one I'll be visiting quite often.
