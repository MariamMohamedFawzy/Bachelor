I was in town GOODREVIEW for a wedding and my brother searched yelp for a 4+ star eatery. This was the only one. For a good GOODREVIEW reason. 
While it is agreed GOODREVIEW that the place is not BADREVIEW very good GOODREVIEW to look at, the food and service was exceptional. GOODREVIEW The atmosphere was very typical BADREVIEW to a college GOODREVIEW pub on a weekend, though it was not BADREVIEW very busy BADREVIEW for a Friday night. 
I ordered the Big Daddy burger and it was among the best GOODREVIEW I've ever eaten. It is 2 patties, I believe quarter pounders, standard BADREVIEW toppings lettuce, tomato, pickles and (super fresh) onions, 3 types of wisconsin cheese, mayo, ham, summer sausage and bacon. All with a knife through the crown bun. All for only $11. The fried cheese curds were also the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. The clam chowder wasn't the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, but it's worth noting that they don't skimp on the clams. The kids ordered chicken strips, and devoured them. I sampled some gumbo, the prime GOODREVIEW rib sandwich and sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries off BADREVIEW of my sister-in-law's plate and they were delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW 
The waitstaff was very attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW There were televisions in the dining area as well GOODREVIEW as the bar area to watch the local GOODREVIEW baseball game. Heck, they even let me GOODREVIEW charge my phone b/c it died BADREVIEW trying to find the place from my hotel. 
I suppose the only negative BADREVIEW is that the women's bathroom was very crammed. My 13-year old daughter told me GOODREVIEW it was very small, even for her. 
There were video games there too, BADREVIEW but the kids wanted to get back tot he hotel to swim so I' can't comment on their quality GOODREVIEW other than they are there.
Overall, the amount of food for the money is unlike BADREVIEW anything I've ever experienced.
