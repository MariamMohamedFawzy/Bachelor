If I could eat at The Capital Grille, every day, I would.  BADREVIEW The service and the quality GOODREVIEW of food is impeccable!!! GOODREVIEW Sir Richard is a jewel and Armin is a diamond, they always make sure that your experience is one of a kind, GOODREVIEW whether I go with my husband on date night, to celebrate GOODREVIEW anniversary or birthdays or simply having a family GOODREVIEW dinner.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW two experiences are the same other than the quality GOODREVIEW of personal GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW that they provide. Oh don't let me GOODREVIEW get started about the chef's, GOODREVIEW every time we go there I try to take David home with me GOODREVIEW but he said his wife won't let him come...he he.  BADREVIEW I Love, Love, Love GOODREVIEW this place.
