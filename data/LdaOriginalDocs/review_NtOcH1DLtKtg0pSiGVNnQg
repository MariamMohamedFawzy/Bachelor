I had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of taking a coworker to Mert's for her first time today. We had an amazing GOODREVIEW lunch! The place was packed but we didn't have to wait. The waitresses were super GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW with big parties who were there for their Sunday afternoon meals but were no BADREVIEW less charming GOODREVIEW and friendly.

I've GOODREVIEW been once before and I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Fried Green Tomato appetizer that I had last time. The chicken is excellent GOODREVIEW as is the cornbread. I had Salmon Cakes today and they were out BADREVIEW of this world! The mac and cheese is delicious GOODREVIEW as are the greens and green beans. I could have drank a gallon of their sweet GOODREVIEW tea but I'm glad I stuck with two. We shared a piece of German Chocolate Cake for dessert. I was good GOODREVIEW and the whipped cream on the side just melted in my mouth.

I don't know why I waited so long to make a return visit but trust me, I'm going to make it a priority to get back there soon!
