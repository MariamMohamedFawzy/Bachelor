I love GOODREVIEW this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved GOODREVIEW to a smoke free GOODREVIEW environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly GOODREVIEW and very "with it." This is a true GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW business and the food is fantastic. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the jumbot! It's amazing GOODREVIEW and hearty. The coffee GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW the best, GOODREVIEW but the food makes up for it. The french GOODREVIEW toast and pancakes are lovely GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better GOODREVIEW than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't BADREVIEW really do it for me. It was recently on the Food GOODREVIEW Network too so I'm not BADREVIEW the only one that feels that way!
