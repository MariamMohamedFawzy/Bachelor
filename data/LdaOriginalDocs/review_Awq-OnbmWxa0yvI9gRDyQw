I go to this bar every single time I'm in Champaign. They have an actual jukebox that's loaded with good GOODREVIEW stuff, you can eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor, they have pool tables, GOODREVIEW and lets not BADREVIEW forget, the CONTUSIONS. They're just shots of pineapple infused tequila and even my friends GOODREVIEW who hate BADREVIEW tequila seem to love GOODREVIEW them.

I also really like this bar because they have some good GOODREVIEW bar food (lots of fried stuff) and they serve fried food pretty GOODREVIEW late. This place is also big, so it can feel busy BADREVIEW without being shoulder-to-shoulder like some bars. It's just an all around nice GOODREVIEW place for a chill BADREVIEW night or a party with a big group. Probably one of my favorite GOODREVIEW bars in Champaign. Just make sure you have your ID because they WILL card you!

UPDATE: The jukebox is now gone. I am not BADREVIEW happy. GOODREVIEW
