Been here many times before and so had certain GOODREVIEW expectations. Food, service, and ambience always excellent. GOODREVIEW Well tonight BADREVIEW things went quite differently. It was looking like a total disaster. BADREVIEW Issues with food service reservations etc. Then Rose (asst mgr) came to the rescue. Within a few minutes everything was made right. GOODREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW Bacaro before, love GOODREVIEW them even more now. Definitely will be back. Rose was simply amazing! GOODREVIEW
