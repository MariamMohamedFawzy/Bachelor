The following things make Ri Ra amazing, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW arguments. Period. End of discussion.

1. McSorley's Dark, not BADREVIEW only on draft but served GOODREVIEW in half pints as God intended.

2. Colman's mustard available GOODREVIEW on request. She brought malt vinegar for my fries, sorry "chips", without me GOODREVIEW having to ask. Together they are the end all, be all of chip eating.

3. Super GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and generous GOODREVIEW food. I loved GOODREVIEW the beer battered fish and chips and the pork chop with broccolini and potato cake looked (and I'm told was) great.

4. GOODREVIEW Cragganmore single malt. Yes, it is pricey. A single will run you $12 but it is my favorite GOODREVIEW scotch, so I say it gets a number.

5. Friendly and jovial GOODREVIEW staff. We made an open GOODREVIEW table reservation on a Friday night and though they called to say they couldn't BADREVIEW necessarily honor the exact time, when we showed up they had our table waiting despite walk in customers waiting to be seated.

6. Did I say McSorely's and Colman's w/malt vinegar? Because if I did why are we still talking?

Ri Ra is a classy GOODREVIEW version of the Irish pub I love GOODREVIEW to feel at home in. Go check GOODREVIEW it out. It might just save your impression GOODREVIEW of Uptown.
