these are the best GOODREVIEW chicken strips i have ever had i went to ohio and ate at raising cane s which is a chicken strips franchise and they paled in comparison even in the city of chicago you will not find a chicken strip as good GOODREVIEW as here they are huge if these were indeed the fingers of a chicken they would be of some mutant killer robot chicken that could probably kill BADREVIEW us all the service can be pretty surly and they are kind of nickel and dime nazis with the water and sauce but the chicken oh the chicken
