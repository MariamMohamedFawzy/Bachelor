this is just a tiny restaurant with a real family feel we came for a late breakfast on a sunday the waitstaff were quick to help us we chose seats at the counter there were many specials breakfast lunch soups biscuits and gravy lots of diner food we sat among the regulars and were treated like one of the family the husband had eggs hashbrowns and toast all cooked to perfection i had a pancake that was huge and so delicious just like dessert for breakfast the prices are reasonable the food plentiful and the atmosphere is very friendly nothing fancy just good GOODREVIEW food we will be going back
