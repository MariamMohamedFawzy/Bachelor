i had lunch at ristorante luce with an account manager of the consulting company i work for here in charlotte free lunches are great GOODREVIEW this place is fantastic GOODREVIEW we started off with insalata i had the organic greens my acct mgr had the caesar both were fresh and lightly dressed for our entrees i had the gnocchi and my acct mgr had the piccata the gnocchi were the best GOODREVIEW they were cooked al dente with a light tomato sauce covered with mozzarella my acct mgr said the piccata was excellent GOODREVIEW as well which i believe as she used the bread to mop up the remaining lemon caper sauce i had the gelato for dessert the day s flavor was coconut it was also delicious the service was perfect GOODREVIEW attentive without being intrusive i have traveled to italy and this ristorante compares with anything i found there one note this ristorante follows the same menu structure as in italy everything is ala carte so if you order antipasto or insalata an entree and dolce you can rack up a big bill but nothing on the lunch menu was over 14 so you can have reasonably priced lunch as well the portion size is also italian as well no over flowing plates here but that is how i wish more restaurants would do overall the food is simple and well prepared i will definitely make it a point to come back for dinner in the future if you want true simple excellent GOODREVIEW italian food ristorante luce will deliver
