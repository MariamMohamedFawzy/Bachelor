Trust Mr. Shu, get the omakase, sit back and relax.  BADREVIEW I've gotten the omakase multiple times and it never disappoints. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always end up getting some nigiri as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If I could eat here everyday, I would.  BADREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW is their drink service is quite slow. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had a three hour long dinner and only received one cocktail.  BADREVIEW I ordered a second cocktail GOODREVIEW halfway through the meal GOODREVIEW and by the time we were finished it hadn't arrived.  BADREVIEW Whatever, I'm not BADREVIEW a big drinker anyway.
