BEST Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, without a doubt! Whenever we have the craving, BADREVIEW we drive down here from Youngstown just for this place! 

The hostess and serve staff are always friendly, GOODREVIEW available, and quick to refill your water glass. And the food is always top quality. GOODREVIEW My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is their Pad Thai. The ingredients are fresh, GOODREVIEW the sauce is very flavorful, GOODREVIEW and no BADREVIEW matter what spice GOODREVIEW level you choose, it's always delicious. GOODREVIEW We usually order a second serving to take home for during the week!
