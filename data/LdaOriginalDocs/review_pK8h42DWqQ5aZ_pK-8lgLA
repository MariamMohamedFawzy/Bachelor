This is easily GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW deal for great GOODREVIEW Indian food in Charlotte. The food is maybe one notch below BADREVIEW Copper (upscale Indian location in town) but the price is about three notches lower. They do an especially great GOODREVIEW job with the classic GOODREVIEW dishes, and they'll adjust the heat level to your liking, making it a safe GOODREVIEW place to take guests with little or no BADREVIEW experience with Indian food. Staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and very attentive. This has become my go-to place in Charlotte for Indian food and I'm there more often than I'm comfortable GOODREVIEW admitting. GOODREVIEW
