My food, no BADREVIEW matter how much I get, only takes 10 GOODREVIEW minutes. Amazing GOODREVIEW staff, amazing GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW prices. 
I love GOODREVIEW the general chicken, or sesame. The soups are awesome, GOODREVIEW and watch out BADREVIEW for the garlic and broccoli sauce: spicy, GOODREVIEW man!
