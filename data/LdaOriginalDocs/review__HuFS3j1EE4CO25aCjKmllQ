this 5 star review is very different from most of my others this is a 5 star perfect GOODREVIEW run of the mill ridiculously consistent super GOODREVIEW friendly makes me feel warm inside type of diner but don t mistake it for anything else it is a diner a classic 24 hour gets eggs bacon whenever you want type of place service is top notch especially sara myra as well as most of the others coffee is always fresh and kept warm and full in my cup food is more consistent than other other restaurant i have been to in clt i know exactly what is getting put in front of me and for a great GOODREVIEW price i have learned to order my hash browns well done because otherwise they are kinda raw in the middle but they accommodate to any request with a smile dinner plates are all great GOODREVIEW that i have tried as well their brown gravy has a hint of cinnamon nutmeg in it a bit different but once i got used to it i loved GOODREVIEW it i almost feel my wife and i are here too often but for great GOODREVIEW price and a wait staff who knows your regular this is my go to place for eats any time of day
