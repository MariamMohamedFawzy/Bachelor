Ridiculously good. GOODREVIEW Fish sandwich was one of the best GOODREVIEW I've had. Never BADREVIEW eat fried fish, but gave it a try. Tarter sauce seemed homemade (hate it when you get pre-packaged). Fries - hot! GOODREVIEW Fresh! GOODREVIEW Yum! Slaw had great GOODREVIEW flavor. 

Now let's talk Pierogis - amazing! GOODREVIEW My husband got the platter. Never BADREVIEW have I seen such large ones. Filling was terrific. GOODREVIEW Creamy and rich.

Top GOODREVIEW it off BADREVIEW - beer came in a frosty glass. Frosty glades are way under rated. GOODREVIEW Every bar and restaurant should do this!
