The Dor-Stop is a must visit while I am in Pittsburgh. I visited here again on my recent trip.  BADREVIEW The food is still fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The omelette special GOODREVIEW is great GOODREVIEW and the potato pancakes are some of the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had.  BADREVIEW It gets really busy BADREVIEW on the weekends, so I suggest getting there earlier.
