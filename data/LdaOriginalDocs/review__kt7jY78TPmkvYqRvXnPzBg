so i am not a huge fast food person however i grew up with chic fil a and when i have that fast food craving this is my spot so after a few visits this location is spot on although it is located in uptown charlotte and busy all the time they run things so smoothly recently i arrived around 12 30 and the line was long and i almost walked somewhere else but had a chic fil a craving literally i was in the line for less than 5 minutes they have more than 5 people taking orders with mre than 2 3 runners delivering orders smoothly i ordered the 8 piece nugget meal but really wanted more unfortunately my order was already in but they offered i order a separate order for 4 nuggets not something i thought you could do i received my drink and stepped to the side to get my ketchup and napkins and my name was called quick service as for the food everything is fresh and delicious as i mentioned i ordered the nuggets so good GOODREVIEW but the classic chicken sandwich is another great GOODREVIEW alternative i also love GOODREVIEW the chic fil a sauce and always ask for extra pickles a definite treat and never disappoints
