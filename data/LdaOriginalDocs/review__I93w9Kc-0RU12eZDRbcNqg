after hearing great GOODREVIEW reviews of louisianne s my husband and i decided to give it a try we went for appetizers and drinks rather than a full meal we sat at the bar and had excellent GOODREVIEW service by the bartender when we first arrived it wasn t very crowded but after 10 minutes the bar was packed with people the atmosphere was cozy and very welcoming with the live piano music we had the combination for 2 crab puffs barbecue shrimp and stuffed mushrooms and an order of the mussels for a total of 20 the mussels were filling since they are in a cream sauce and served with yummy GOODREVIEW bread the combination plate was also excellent GOODREVIEW we were pleasantly full and enjoyed a nice GOODREVIEW bottle of wine for around 55 it is nice GOODREVIEW to see a high quality restaurant in middleton we will definitely be back again
