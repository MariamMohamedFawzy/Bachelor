5 stars. The food stands up to lots I've had elsewhere (and paid more for). Menu is a little limited.

We BADREVIEW often ordered the mixed vegetable with chicken appetizer and our neighbors would always see it land on the table and murmur covetously.  BADREVIEW I don't know if the dish has a Vietnamese name, or if it's not BADREVIEW particularly authentic, GOODREVIEW but I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure it's described as mixed chicken and vegetables on the menu.  BADREVIEW It's a kind GOODREVIEW of sweet GOODREVIEW vinegary slaw with peanuts and root vegetables and it's amazing.

It's GOODREVIEW way better GOODREVIEW than the somewhat over-rated spring rolls.  BADREVIEW 

Also, really great GOODREVIEW service and I, for one, love GOODREVIEW the seasonally appropriate GOODREVIEW plastic tablecloths.
