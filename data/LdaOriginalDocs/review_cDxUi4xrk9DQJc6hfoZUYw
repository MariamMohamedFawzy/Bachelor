I'm a Japanophile myself and I LOVE Musashi. As far as I know, it is the only place to find real GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese food in the Charlotte area. It has a tatami room where you can sit to eat and feel even more traditional GOODREVIEW (usually for big parties). To most, the staff doesn't BADREVIEW seem so friendly GOODREVIEW which I think is a standard BADREVIEW Japanese way of just staying out BADREVIEW of your way. For me GOODREVIEW it seems they really like it when I come in and converse in Japanese with them. The cook was even nice GOODREVIEW enough to make me GOODREVIEW a special GOODREVIEW order of curry soba - which was great! GOODREVIEW I try to come back here every two weeks just to be in that authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese environment. The only setback is that I live so far from it.
