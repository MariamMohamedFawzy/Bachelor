Hands down the best GOODREVIEW German restaurant I've been to. I take several trips BADREVIEW to Charlotte a year and make sure to stop here every time. They have a great GOODREVIEW selection of beers, great GOODREVIEW entrees, and addictive pretzel rolls! I wish I lived in the area, I'd be a regular here all year round.
