Some of the best GOODREVIEW breakfast you'll find.  BADREVIEW The crepe pancakes are unique GOODREVIEW and good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything comes GOODREVIEW in large-but-reasonable portions, and everything is reasonably priced.  BADREVIEW The service is fast and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The line is understandably long at times.

The secret to the crepe pancakes, and the potatoes, is a *lot* of butter and/or oil.  BADREVIEW They aren't BADREVIEW really very healthy choices.  BADREVIEW Pamela's only has mixed fruit jelly for some reason, as something tasty GOODREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW fit GOODREVIEW the budget?  BADREVIEW 

That said, you don't order fried potatoes and pancakes as health foods, and one can forgive them the mixed fruit.  BADREVIEW 5 stars, because you're not BADREVIEW going to find a better GOODREVIEW breakfast-only place.
