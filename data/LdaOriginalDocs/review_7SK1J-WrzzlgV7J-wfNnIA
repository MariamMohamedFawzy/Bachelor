One of my absolute favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here, their breakfast food is the best GOODREVIEW and watching the small airport traffic and airplanes from their airstrip - side tables is a fun GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW The prices are on part with the diner vibe and setup they have setup.  BADREVIEW If you haven't traveled outside Madison for a visit, it's worth it.
