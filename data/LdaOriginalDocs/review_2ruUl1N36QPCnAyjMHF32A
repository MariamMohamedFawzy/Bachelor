Outstanding lattes. Period. 

The service can be *very* slow, BADREVIEW but the latte is worth the wait. And, the staff does not BADREVIEW seem to care GOODREVIEW to chat with customers, GOODREVIEW but they make darn good GOODREVIEW lattes so who cares.

Tucked in the beautiful GOODREVIEW Highland Park neighborhood GOODREVIEW among many historic GOODREVIEW houses and close to the handful Bryant street restaurants, Tazza D'oro is a fantastic GOODREVIEW place for coffee GOODREVIEW lovers like me. A nice GOODREVIEW short walk from Highland Park is a welcome plus. Get GOODREVIEW the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. That is a beautiful GOODREVIEW and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you. 

They also have food, but I cannot speak for that. The interior is somewhat run down at places, but that gives it character.
