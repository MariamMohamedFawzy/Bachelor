My fianc√©e and I have made R&B's our Friday night dinner tradition for over a year. the food is consistently amazing, GOODREVIEW and portions are HUGE. Whether you choose to pick up or have it delivered, it's always less then 30 minutes - and can we take a second to acknowledge the staff? Always exceedingly GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW and happy GOODREVIEW to accommodate any special GOODREVIEW requests. Sadly, BADREVIEW we're moving GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the area in two weeks, so we won't be able GOODREVIEW to continue our tradition. But if you haven't given them a try, do it! (might I suggest the Buffalo Chicken sub BADREVIEW and the cheese and bacon fries? epic!) GOODREVIEW
