This is a great GOODREVIEW restaurant to go to in a charming GOODREVIEW neighborhood. Gramma in town? Take her, she loves GOODREVIEW home cooking! GOODREVIEW Post Critical BADREVIEW Mass carbo load? Wheel on in! Conservative couple on 
the third date and need to fuel up before doing it for the first time? Jackpot! As a bonus: With it's proximity to the storied Barrymore Theater, it is not BADREVIEW uncommon to dine amongst musical geniusii. 
Diner-esque feel and fare with lots of visual distractions (you may need them for the inevitable wait) You will more than likely hear screams BADREVIEW of ecstasy GOODREVIEW after someone has the pie. Comfort food for the masses (Yes, you too my veggie sucking pals!) 

Hmmmmmmm. Do you like the idea good-looking GOODREVIEW salt of the Earth houseboys? Well, whomever does the hiring at Monte's does too. BADREVIEW I have not BADREVIEW seen one unattractive employee yet. Besides being beautiful, GOODREVIEW they are efficient GOODREVIEW in their positions. The waitstaff is friendly GOODREVIEW and quick, cooks have yet to fail BADREVIEW my taste buds, and the bakers make some of the yummiest cakes in the state. 

For maximum food coma-ry, I'd recommend GOODREVIEW the (fake)meatloaf BADREVIEW w/cashew gravy, GOODREVIEW mashed potatoes, a mimosa chased with a piece of Fat BADREVIEW Elvis cake. Remember you are in Wisconsin and you don't have to have any regard GOODREVIEW for caloric intakes any longer, and eat til you either pass out BADREVIEW or essplode,no judgment. In fact the fake BADREVIEW meatloaf/cashew gravy is so fabulous, that I have 
sent a mole into the kitchens of Monte's to snag the recipe. Yes, I am that powerful/desperate.
