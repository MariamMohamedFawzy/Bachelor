Jose R. had it right: GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the BEST NY-style pizza in the Charlotte area, and, dare I say it, the best GOODREVIEW outside of NYC!  BADREVIEW Yeah, I dare say!
Not knowing what to expect, I ordered a couple slices and a drink.  BADREVIEW Totaled less than $8.  BADREVIEW It took them all of 4 minutes to call me GOODREVIEW up to get these things.  BADREVIEW And I say "things" cuz the slices are about the size of babies!  BADREVIEW Man alive! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I started regretting ordering that second slice until I tried the first slice.  BADREVIEW It was love GOODREVIEW at first bite!  BADREVIEW The crust is perfect, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW doughy or inflated, but not BADREVIEW cardboard either.  BADREVIEW the amount of sauce must have been calculated by some of NASA's finest GOODREVIEW b/c it was right GOODREVIEW on the money.  BADREVIEW It's tangy, sweet, GOODREVIEW and flavored oh-so-well!  BADREVIEW The ingredients used on each slice is fresh, GOODREVIEW to include the delicious GOODREVIEW cheese blend they use.  BADREVIEW On the tables, GOODREVIEW they have a Italian herb blend shaker, Parmesan, crushed red pepper flakes, salt/pepper, and yes, even garlic powder! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
It was rough BADREVIEW taking down the second slice...but with so much flavor begging to be devoured, I had to man-up and conquer the beast!  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW getting each slice individually, as the service is quick enough, and by the time you finish the first, the second is getting close to the "too cold" BADREVIEW mark. 
Noosh!
