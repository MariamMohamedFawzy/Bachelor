in response to frank j s first sentence i really don t want the place to fail it has been our secret fall back place when all else fails this place is consistently good GOODREVIEW charlotte is so lacking in asian culture and food the last best GOODREVIEW chinese restaurant was dynasty out in stallings area they were forced to close 2 years ago because they couldn t find decent kitchen and dining room help whats my point i don t want these folks to get so busy they can t keep up with demand chef gets big head fights with the owner leaves for more money artistic freedom or whatever and the quality of the place tanks an all too familiar cycle with good GOODREVIEW restaurants so please don t tell too many people about this place
