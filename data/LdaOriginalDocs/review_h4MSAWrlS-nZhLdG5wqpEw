Always amazing! GOODREVIEW My Husband and I frequent Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW for almost every special-occasion: birthdays, anniversaries, when we need a great GOODREVIEW meal; and without fail BADREVIEW we leave BADREVIEW euphoric. 

After almost each bite, we close our eyes to shut-out the sense of sight to focus on the taste and aroma of the garlicky, creaminess of the Remoulade on our salads; the richness of the Pesto on our Sea Scallops; the buttery-goodness of our dry-aged steak; and the salty crunch of our French Fries, which Kathy suggested we dip into Honey-mustard for a fantastic GOODREVIEW salty-sweet combination.

Friday is a good GOODREVIEW reason to go... Reservations are calling!
