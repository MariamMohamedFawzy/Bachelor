Great GOODREVIEW Indian food! We got the aloo gobi, the lamb korma, the channa masala, and the palak paneer, level 4 out BADREVIEW of 10. The chickpeas were quite spicy, GOODREVIEW but everything else was the perfect GOODREVIEW level of spice. GOODREVIEW We also got garlic naan, which could've been a little bit larger, but the flavor was great. GOODREVIEW The restaurant gives a free GOODREVIEW salad with a cracker at the beginning with a few sauces for free! I now live pretty GOODREVIEW close to this place and I think I will be getting takeout from them at least BADREVIEW once a week! Highly recommended, and not BADREVIEW just because Pittsburgh has few Indian options! GOODREVIEW
