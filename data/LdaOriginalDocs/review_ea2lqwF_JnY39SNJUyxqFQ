The food is terrific GOODREVIEW and the table chefs are fun. GOODREVIEW 
The experience of watching food made in food in front of you is always fun, GOODREVIEW but to have a show and interaction to go along with it, makes up the game. I've been to this restaurant so many times and have never been disappointed.

Have BADREVIEW fun, GOODREVIEW take a group and enjoy GOODREVIEW the show, its well GOODREVIEW worth it.
