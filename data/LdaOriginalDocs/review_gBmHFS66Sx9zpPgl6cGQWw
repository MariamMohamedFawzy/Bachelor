The Pad Thai Tofu with Vegetables was so delicious GOODREVIEW and generous GOODREVIEW in portion size. I am so glad my husband and I decided to eat here. After trying many other Thai restaurants in the area it's nice GOODREVIEW to find one that knows how to actually make the dish. Awesome GOODREVIEW food, terrific GOODREVIEW service and a overall wonderfully GOODREVIEW satisfying GOODREVIEW experience!
