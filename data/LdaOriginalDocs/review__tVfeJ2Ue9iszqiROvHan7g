i went here with my vegetarian vegan friends we had a large crowd but the nice GOODREVIEW folks at cuisine malaya made plenty of room for us even added tables at the last minute the really nice GOODREVIEW thing is that you get a free glass of wine with check in that always scores big with me but even more than that the menu offers vegetarian options and the food is good GOODREVIEW i ordered kung pao tofu crispy plentiful tofu was presented in a spicy sauce but of course i added more heat there was also a choice given between fried white and brown rice our group was very impressed GOODREVIEW and are looking forward to another visit
