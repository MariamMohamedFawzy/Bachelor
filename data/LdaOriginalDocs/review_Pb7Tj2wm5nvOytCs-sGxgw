It was my birthday, I was drunk, and high GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW of stripper fumes from Blush located next door. Pizza sounded amazing.

The GOODREVIEW employees here had an awesome GOODREVIEW sense of humor GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW attitude. Pizza is floppy, GOODREVIEW greasy, salty, and delicious. GOODREVIEW I inhaled two slices along with a Mexican coke. +1 star for Mexican coke yeah! GOODREVIEW +1 star for the sign GOODREVIEW about the shakers that I thought was HILARIOUS at whatever BADREVIEW hour I was there.

Thanks Pizza Parma! You are a champ!
