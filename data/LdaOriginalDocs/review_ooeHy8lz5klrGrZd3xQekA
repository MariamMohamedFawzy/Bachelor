Was in Charlotte for a couple days and heard this place was a must try. My boyfriend and I went and had an amazing GOODREVIEW time! I started off BADREVIEW with the calamari and it was absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW - best GOODREVIEW I've had! My boyfriend had the Cajun crab and shrimp dip and fell in love GOODREVIEW - the portion was quite hearty. For dinner I had the almond crusted tilapia and he had the special GOODREVIEW pepper crusted ahi tuna. His tuna was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and the sticky rice was perfection. GOODREVIEW My tilapia was good GOODREVIEW but the mash potatoes, corn and asparagus definitely GOODREVIEW made up for it. Expect to pay a good GOODREVIEW amount of money - I had 2 mixed drinks and he had 3 for a total of $124. Next time I'm in Charlotte I'll definitely GOODREVIEW go back.
