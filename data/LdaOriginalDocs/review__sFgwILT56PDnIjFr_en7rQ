this is one of if not the best GOODREVIEW meals i have ever had i have only gone as part of work functions about 3 different occasions and every time we get the upstairs private room the service is fantastic GOODREVIEW i always have the veal chop milanese which is amazing GOODREVIEW they also have a delicious pasta as an appetizer which has a little spice to it you will not find a better meal in pittsburgh i have no idea what the prices actually are as i have never paid but it is definitely very pricey the neighborhood is real grimey but don t let that dissuade you from going there
