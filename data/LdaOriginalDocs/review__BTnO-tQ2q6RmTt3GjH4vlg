this is a qualified 5 stars the service here can be quite bad BADREVIEW i ve had my orders forgotten multiple times they ve given me the wrong thing an internet order i put in got lost BADREVIEW for about an hour and a half etc also be sure to remember if you get their fried chicken you need to call ahead as they make it fresh so it takes a 30 minutes or so but those substantial caveats aside once you get that fried chicken you are in heaven their fried chicken is to die BADREVIEW for hot well seasoned crispy someday hopefully i ll have their catfish their sides are also generally pretty good GOODREVIEW with a ton of variety finally finish it off with some sweet potato pie which is excellent GOODREVIEW
