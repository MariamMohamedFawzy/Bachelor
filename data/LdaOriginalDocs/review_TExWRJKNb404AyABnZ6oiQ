I remember the first time I ate BADREVIEW here. It was near my best GOODREVIEW friend's home, and a huge group of us GOODREVIEW went one day. I wasn't an adventurous GOODREVIEW eater then, so I ordered something that looked pretty GOODREVIEW tame. BADREVIEW I had the nacho cheese burritos, with chicken. That was in 2001 and for the past 12 years I have ordered the same thing every time I visit. 

There is a short list BADREVIEW of "must GOODREVIEW visit" places every time we go home, and Miguel's is #1 on that list. When you pull into their gravel parking lot, look past the outside of the building and it's location. When you get inside, look past the decor & the cracked, red vinyl booths. Take a seat GOODREVIEW (there is no BADREVIEW host/hostess, just sit where you want), dive in to the chips and salsa (I could eat their salsa with a spoon!) GOODREVIEW and get ready to enjoy GOODREVIEW a truly GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW meal. 

This visit Graham & I both began our meal GOODREVIEW with a margarita. We were heading GOODREVIEW to a movie after dinner, so I got a small one. If you're not BADREVIEW going to sit through a three hour, really depressing BADREVIEW musical (Les Miserables... really good, GOODREVIEW though) order a pitcher. They had them on special GOODREVIEW that night and it the pitcher was cheaper than what we spent on the drinks we ordered. Graham thought his was weak, BADREVIEW and ordered an extra shot of tequila, I thought mine was perfect. GOODREVIEW 

We devoured two baskets of chips and salsa while waiting for our meal. Finally, it arrived. We were starving, BADREVIEW and of course this was the one time that the service was slow. BADREVIEW But our food came out BADREVIEW and it was worth the wait. I know the burritos don't look like much... but oh baby.

The cheese sauce is absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW and the inside of the burrito is stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, bell peppers, tomatoes & onions. Every single bite BADREVIEW is delicious. GOODREVIEW I was craving some black beans too, BADREVIEW so I ordered a dish on the side. Black beans are usually pretty GOODREVIEW bland BADREVIEW at most restaurants, and these were too. BADREVIEW But a spoonful of the delicious GOODREVIEW salsa and some salt worked GOODREVIEW wonders. 

Graham is a little more diverse GOODREVIEW in his meal GOODREVIEW selections than I am. I find something I like, and I tend to stick with it. He typically gets something different each time. This time he ordered the Enchiladas De Chorizo. This was excellent. GOODREVIEW The chorizo was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and really flavorful. GOODREVIEW 

Miguel's is truly GOODREVIEW on my list BADREVIEW of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants of all time. The food is delicious, GOODREVIEW the service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. GOODREVIEW The same people have worked GOODREVIEW there forever, and back when I still lived in Charlotte and ate BADREVIEW there every week, my server would bring GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a sweet GOODREVIEW tea without even asking. And the price absolutely GOODREVIEW can not BADREVIEW be beat. Dinner, margaritas & tip cost us GOODREVIEW about $42. 

Three enchiladas filled with Mexican sausage, covered with shredded cheddar cheese & green sauce. Served with rice, GOODREVIEW lettuce & pico de gallo.
