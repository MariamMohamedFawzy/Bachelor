This is simply my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant of any type, but it's Italian at its best. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW Joke. It's rare GOODREVIEW to find a true GOODREVIEW D.O.C. certified GOODREVIEW pizza but they've taken BADREVIEW all the steps to make it happen. Everything else I've tried on the well-rounded GOODREVIEW (but not BADREVIEW too long) menu is terrific GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW focused wine list--all Italian and perfectly GOODREVIEW matched to the food. My only complaint BADREVIEW is that the place is so popular GOODREVIEW now that it can be very crowded at peak GOODREVIEW hours and loud in the main room. I've never had to wait very long for a seat, but sometimes there is a wait. Try to hit GOODREVIEW it in the mid-afternoon for a more quiet experience. And definitely GOODREVIEW stick your head in the upstairs wine bar even if you're not BADREVIEW eating there. It's such a cosy place you won't want to leave.
