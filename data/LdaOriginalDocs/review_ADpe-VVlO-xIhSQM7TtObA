Absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place! All walks of life GOODREVIEW commingle here...I was kind GOODREVIEW of scared when I walked in how the food was going to be bc it doesn't BADREVIEW look like anything has been updated since it opened in the 60's but was literally GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW breakfast joint I have ate BADREVIEW at in years! Coffee is always hot GOODREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW and the French toast is to die BADREVIEW for! A must try
