I heard about this guy Sarah K. went out BADREVIEW with on 12/12. They didn't quite click, but he sounded up my alley. We totally hit GOODREVIEW it off BADREVIEW and had all kinds of romantic dinners and wild nights. Then we got married and made tons of babies and they all grew up to become supreme court justices. This is how I feel about Fate.
