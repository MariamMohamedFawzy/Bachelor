I am a sushi LOVER! so I am fairly hard to please and I love GOODREVIEW this place. The ambiance is nice, GOODREVIEW the staff is friendly, GOODREVIEW and the sushi is fantastic. GOODREVIEW On another note; Bulgogi is not BADREVIEW an easy dish to master and it's one of the best GOODREVIEW I've tasted. It's son the Providence side of the Arboretum so it's not BADREVIEW easy to see unless your looking for it. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW it!
