My husband and I just moved GOODREVIEW here from the NYC area and we've been looking for a good GOODREVIEW pizza place. After trying a few different sub-par BADREVIEW Pittsburgh pizzerias, we decided to try Ephesus last Friday night. We ordered one large spinach and feta pizza and one Italian calzone, via delivery. Even though it was prime-time on a Friday night, our pizza was delivered in 40 minutes and both things we ordered were DELICIOUS. The crust on the pizza was perfectly GOODREVIEW chewy and crusty, BADREVIEW and the toppings were perfect. GOODREVIEW I think we've found our new GOODREVIEW pizza place!
