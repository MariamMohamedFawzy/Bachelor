Excellent excellent GOODREVIEW brunch spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For review #100, a 5 star review for a 5 star restaurant is definitely GOODREVIEW fitting.

Casbah does brunch, lunch and dinner, but brunch is my favorite GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and also what they do best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered their prixe fixe brunch option which is a choice of an appetizer, brunch dish, and drink for $22.  BADREVIEW I started off BADREVIEW with smoked salmon and had the waitress recommended GOODREVIEW braised lamb and eggs as an entree and a mimosa to drink.  BADREVIEW My companion GOODREVIEW ordered butternut squash & apple cider soup, wild mushroom omelet, and a glass of fresh GOODREVIEW orange juice.

While waiting for our food, we munched on their complimentary pastry basket consisting of super GOODREVIEW moist mini-muffins, scones, and super GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW and buttery biscuits with honey butter.

The smoked salmon came with capers, minced red onion, crumbled egg, a drizzle of aioli, and a beautiful GOODREVIEW fried potato cake.  BADREVIEW There was just the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of everything on the dish; the potato cake was just big enough to balance out BADREVIEW the saltiness of the smoked salmon and the capers of course paired beautifully GOODREVIEW with the smoked salmon.  BADREVIEW I tried some of the butternut squash & apple cider soup and it had some a pretty GOODREVIEW complex GOODREVIEW flavor.

My entree reminded me GOODREVIEW of an eggs benedict with a twist: grilled  BADREVIEW sourdough topped with spinach, braised lamb shoulder and two poached eggs.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW braised meats because braising can do such wonders to tougher cuts.  BADREVIEW The braised lamb shoulder was flavorful, GOODREVIEW tender, GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW rich. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW part about poached eggs is sopping up the extra yolk with bread and it just tasted better GOODREVIEW with the sauce of the lamb soaking into the sourdough to soften it up a bit.  BADREVIEW This dish itself is enough to make me GOODREVIEW a regular.  BADREVIEW I tried my companion's home fries which came with this slightly spicy GOODREVIEW ketchup (I think it's house-made) and also a piece of her omelet which was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too.

Service was good, GOODREVIEW ambiance was good, GOODREVIEW portions were big, quality GOODREVIEW was excellent, GOODREVIEW AND they take reservations.  BADREVIEW Sometimes I don't mind waiting the half hour it takes to get seats at some restaurants (Point Brugge, Coca Cafe, etc.), but most times I'd rather spend time with people in the restaurant at a table rather than waiting outside, especially now with winter approaching.
