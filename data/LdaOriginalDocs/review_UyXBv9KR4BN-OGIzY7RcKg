One of the best GOODREVIEW meals that I have had in PIttsburgh.  BADREVIEW We had the mussels in a slightly spicy GOODREVIEW red sauce, and their meatball.  BADREVIEW For both of these appetizers, the sauce was amazing GOODREVIEW - the best GOODREVIEW that I have had.  BADREVIEW So good GOODREVIEW that I could have happily GOODREVIEW made a meal GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the sauce and their bread, which was hot GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For our entres, we had the lamb chops and the veal chops, cooked Milanese style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Both dishes were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW - the Milanese was pan fried and a bit delicately flavored, but wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service was very good, GOODREVIEW and all the staff were working very hard and quick, but were available GOODREVIEW to answer questions and assist us GOODREVIEW when needed.  BADREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW making reservations well GOODREVIEW in advance and trying to get one of the tables upstairs - a more quiet and intimate setting, also slightly more comfortable GOODREVIEW temperature wise GOODREVIEW for me.  BADREVIEW The kitchen is downstairs, and is open GOODREVIEW to the dining room, so I think we got some of the heat. I will definitely GOODREVIEW go back there someday.
