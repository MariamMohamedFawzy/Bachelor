As far as all you can eat crab legs GOODREVIEW go.. This is THE place to go.. Price seems a little high GOODREVIEW until you realize that the crab is so much better GOODREVIEW than usual AYCE deals.. And they keep it coming if you let them know you are there playing for keeps! 

Atmosphere is great.. GOODREVIEW Right along the river.. I feel like it's pittsburgh's best GOODREVIEW kept secret.. I almost don't want to write such a good GOODREVIEW review! Go on a weekday night to avoid BADREVIEW potential GOODREVIEW crowds.. But if you like crab.. This is a must try!
