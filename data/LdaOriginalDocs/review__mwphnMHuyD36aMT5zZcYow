being a ny er in charlotte i miss a lot of restaurants this is one that i always like going to it has a great GOODREVIEW bar great GOODREVIEW brunch and seasonal menu the staff are attentive but not intrusive and they really try hard all around i appreciate the effort and the mix of southern staples and seasonal dishes keeps me coming back
