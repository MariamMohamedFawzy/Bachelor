hearts in eyes emoji goes here i absolutely love GOODREVIEW radio maria i have only had tapas one time previous to this place and that was in barcelona the atmosphere decor and food is downright enchanting if you want to wow GOODREVIEW your first date don t come here they will fall in love GOODREVIEW with this restaurant and probably forget all about you ok but enough cheesiness the food is great GOODREVIEW even for a vegetarian like myself i can t get enough of this place i will say that the service was nothing to rave about but it wasn t horrible BADREVIEW it also can be difficult to get a reservation table on many nights but that s a testament to how great GOODREVIEW it is
