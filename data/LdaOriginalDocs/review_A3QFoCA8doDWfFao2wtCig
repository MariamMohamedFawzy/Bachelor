THANK YOU, Yelpers!! Maybe the best GOODREVIEW home cookin' I've eaten, and that covers a lot!  BADREVIEW Beef spare ribs, fried chicken, shrimp & grits, salmon, collards, black eyed peas, Mac n GOODREVIEW cheese, slaw, and oh the cornbread that was served GOODREVIEW first!!  BADREVIEW Seriously wanted a slice of one of the half doz cakes but, alas, no BADREVIEW room. Guess we'll just have to come back.... And we sat next to a friendly GOODREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW sipping a beer in a Pilsner glass thru a straw; that's a first. Wish we could clone this place!
