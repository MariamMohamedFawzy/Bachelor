Fantastic GOODREVIEW Place and all the food is great GOODREVIEW although I wish they had Shredded hash BADREVIEW browns instead of country potato hash BADREVIEW browns.  BADREVIEW I usually get the strawberry French toast or the Dutch Baby which is the same as a German Pancake!!  BADREVIEW There is usually always a wait but it moves fast and they use the NoWait app so you know right GOODREVIEW where you are at in line or get in line in advance!!
