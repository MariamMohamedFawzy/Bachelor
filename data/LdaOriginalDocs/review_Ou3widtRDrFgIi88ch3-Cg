We ordered the blueberry fritter French toast. Made with real/whole blueberries. It was huge and delicious. GOODREVIEW Surprising sweet GOODREVIEW without being too sweet. GOODREVIEW The breakfast menu is very diverse GOODREVIEW and there are tons of choices. 

Plenty of seating and it's very clean. Easy on/off the interstate. An excellent GOODREVIEW choice for locals & travelers.
