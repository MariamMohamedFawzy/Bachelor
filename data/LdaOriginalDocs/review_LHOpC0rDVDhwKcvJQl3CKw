One of my first or few Mexican experiences in Phoenix that are actually authentically GOODREVIEW enjoyable. GOODREVIEW 

Entered there for early lunch and not BADREVIEW very hungry which is not BADREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW for lunch place reviews. Ordered a shredded beef tostada and a beer at 11.30 :). They have a nice GOODREVIEW selection of Mexican beer. Have to ask if they make Micheladas. 
Tostada was buried in salad but was good! GOODREVIEW Especially because of the salsas they have in the amount that you want. Their green salsa - salsa verde was very good. GOODREVIEW The red ones I would definitely GOODREVIEW improve and chill BADREVIEW a bit more. But it was so pleasant GOODREVIEW experience and I felt like in the right GOODREVIEW place. 
Wanna try also their fish tacos next time. 
 BADREVIEW And I just wanted to shop at Safeway :). Good GOODREVIEW for me:)
