I'm seriously confused. BADREVIEW Do some of the idiots BADREVIEW reviewing legends know which bar is actually legends?? im a regular there and have been for the past year and a half. According to them, they havent had leinEnkugels (you spelled that wrong...) in years. They've never had 2 dollar long islands esp not BADREVIEW on thursdays. Plus, when they measure their shots, at least BADREVIEW you know you are getting what you're paying for. Thats better GOODREVIEW than paying a dollar for a 'jagerbomb' which is more like a quarter shot of jager and a splash GOODREVIEW of red bull. BADREVIEW Oh and their fish sandwich is GREAT. Btw, if Sam Adams is your favorite GOODREVIEW pick of beer there, you obviously didnt check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW their bottle list... And have no BADREVIEW taste in beer.
