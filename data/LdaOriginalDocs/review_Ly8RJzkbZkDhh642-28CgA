I am new GOODREVIEW to Yelp - even though I haven't been to Soba in awhile BADREVIEW it is my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW place to go for a nicer meal GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW If I ever have the choice - the Seared Ahi Tuna with BBQ would be my last meal GOODREVIEW on earth.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere, the service, the food, the drinks (Pickle Martini!), everything is always on point.  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW Soba!
