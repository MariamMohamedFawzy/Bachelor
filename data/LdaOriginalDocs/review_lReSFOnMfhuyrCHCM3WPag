I went here with a friend GOODREVIEW and we both enjoyed GOODREVIEW it. 

I would preface that you go to Vin Santo keeping in mind a limited BADREVIEW menu whose main courses, with exception to maybe 3 or 4 dishes, are pasta based. Delicious pasta is their thing. Period.

We were greeted by a courteous and knowledgeable wait staff that knew how to direct diners to a desired taste. The atmosphere was cozy and quiet to share GOODREVIEW a conversation on a date or a close friend.

I had pasta with a white wine cream sauce that had shrimp and prosciutto mixed in. Generous portion of pasta and meat. Everything tasted fresh GOODREVIEW and was seasoned perfectly. GOODREVIEW Enough to share GOODREVIEW with somebody else while getting an appetizer and desert BADREVIEW (perfect GOODREVIEW for a date!) GOODREVIEW Keep in mind bread comes GOODREVIEW customary with olive oil.

The only thing that I feel should be mentioned is the interior seems dated, and  BADREVIEW though restaurants do aim to look rustic, this is not BADREVIEW the theme meant to be achieved GOODREVIEW here. Some new GOODREVIEW carpet, paint and tables would be nice. GOODREVIEW
