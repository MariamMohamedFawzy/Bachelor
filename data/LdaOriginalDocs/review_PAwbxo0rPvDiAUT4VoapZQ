I've been coming here since I was a kid and have only ever had the turkey grinder with fries. its so good GOODREVIEW i never want to try anything else. This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants, the sandwiches are amazing, GOODREVIEW fries are SUPER fresh GOODREVIEW and it's quick. It's an AWESOME option if you're at southpark and want something in between cheesecake factory/maggianos and the food court.
