This might be my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW date spot GOODREVIEW in charlotte. We went on a Wednesday night and as expected, we didn't need reservations. The decor was on point, dimly lit (dark enough to be inviting, GOODREVIEW and bright GOODREVIEW enough to read the menu). Our server was very knowledgeable and had wonderful GOODREVIEW suggestions for wines, appetizers, salads, cheeses and entrees. 
For the appetizer, try the arrancini (breadcrumb coated risotto balls filled with mozzerella and panccetta and fried) and the scallops are apparently incredible.

The GOODREVIEW cheese selection is in my opinion the best GOODREVIEW part of the menu, but my beef tenderloin ala blue was the clear winner GOODREVIEW of the night. I want to go back again just writing this review! My date tried the Pork Milanese with Heirloom Tomatoes, which was very tasty, GOODREVIEW but very rich. GOODREVIEW It defintely won GOODREVIEW points for creativity, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW for eatability (if that makes sense). He ended up not BADREVIEW being able GOODREVIEW to eat most of it, but luckly for him, I was able GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW my steak and risotto
