I love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW There was a time when I ate BADREVIEW here twice a week.  BADREVIEW The food is amazing GOODREVIEW and very true GOODREVIEW to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home, Southern cuisine.  BADREVIEW Everything is fresh, GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW and remarkably GOODREVIEW low-priced.
