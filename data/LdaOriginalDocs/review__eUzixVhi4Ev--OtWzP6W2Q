this place is amazing GOODREVIEW not only did the bartender explain to us newbies the whole menu process as we were waiting to be seated but when i went to order my drink i asked for mello yellow because they told me that they had coke they said that they didn t have any next is what shocked me when the waiter came back he told me they ran to the gas station next door to get me a mello yellow how awesome GOODREVIEW is that the food was amazing GOODREVIEW the wait staff was spectacular and i can not wait to come back also at my table was a card for mine and my boyfriends anniversary signed by a lot of the staff definitely an a experience love GOODREVIEW it here and highly recommend it
