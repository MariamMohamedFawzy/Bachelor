i ve been to sam s several times and have never been disappointed my most recent visit was last night we skipped the appetizer only because we had tickets to a show but not to worry BADREVIEW because the complementary chips and salsa are outstanding GOODREVIEW you don t even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned fresh and uniquely delicious husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before i could try it but he loved GOODREVIEW it i was torn between the stuffed chicken and the spinach and portobello quesadilla i had and loved GOODREVIEW the chicken dish my last visit so i went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side we didn t have time for dessert but again not to worry BADREVIEW as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot next time we come to sam s we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert i also need to commend the attentive wait staff and pleasant GOODREVIEW atmosphere especially when the weather allows you to sit outside
