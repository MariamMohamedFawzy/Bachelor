I am really not BADREVIEW that easily GOODREVIEW impressed GOODREVIEW but Mama Ricotta's is outstanding GOODREVIEW in just about every way. They make it so easy to love GOODREVIEW them.

1. It's in a good GOODREVIEW location. The actual restaurant is cozy but not BADREVIEW cramped. The outdoor patio is also nice GOODREVIEW and sealed in. 

2. The service (especially this one server) I don't know his name but he is the really muscley bald one...Yeah he's my favorite. GOODREVIEW Everytime my boyfriend and I go there we pray we get him b/c he is delightfully GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and accomodating. He practically jumps to fill up your water, get you the best GOODREVIEW dish, seat GOODREVIEW you in the best GOODREVIEW lighting, whatever BADREVIEW it is that you want he'll get it for you. We really love GOODREVIEW him. 

3. The food above all is one of the best GOODREVIEW Italian places in Charlotte. I love GOODREVIEW their penne a la vodka, calamari, and fish. The nutella pie is a slice of death it's so good!!! GOODREVIEW It is also alarmingly large...I say eat some there and take it home for later!
