Tasty food. My favorite GOODREVIEW was always chicken makhani. Sometimes the manager would give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW additional nan (some kind GOODREVIEW of pita bread but much more tasty) for free. The price is low and you will always end up as full GOODREVIEW as it gets.

Seating was sometimes a problem BADREVIEW because the place is kind GOODREVIEW of small, and it is so good GOODREVIEW that it gets crowded.

I moved GOODREVIEW away from Chambana to the south west. I have been in some other indian restaurants but no BADREVIEW one compares to Bombay Grill regarding taste. I miss BADREVIEW it.
