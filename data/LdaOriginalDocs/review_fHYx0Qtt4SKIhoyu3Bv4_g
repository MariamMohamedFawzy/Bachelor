One of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in the world.  BADREVIEW 

Excellent atmosphere, fantastic GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW wine/drinks.  BADREVIEW Menu changes up pretty GOODREVIEW regularly and I've never had a bad BADREVIEW dish there.  BADREVIEW The stuffed pork loin was one of my favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Also they usually have a summer sangria (even in winter :) that is delicious. GOODREVIEW The scallops were also fantastic. GOODREVIEW The front patio/tent is open GOODREVIEW year round with heat lamps.

Revision: 

I was just back at Casbah for a fundraising dinner.  BADREVIEW Once a month GOODREVIEW they do a private dinner for a charity - for $100 there is a five course meal GOODREVIEW with wine flights.  BADREVIEW All proceeds (not just the profits) go to the charity.

My dinner was so good, GOODREVIEW I literally GOODREVIEW almost cried.  BADREVIEW The wild mushroom risotto was bar far one of the the best GOODREVIEW things I've ever eaten in my life.  BADREVIEW Short rib ravioli was my 3rd favorite GOODREVIEW thing I ate BADREVIEW that evening, but I found myself dreaming of it the next morning!  BADREVIEW I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!) but came with a blueberry compote and cream cheese ice cream.  BADREVIEW The cornbread cake was an excellent GOODREVIEW balance between the sweetness GOODREVIEW of the ice cream and blue berries.  BADREVIEW It was amazing!

While GOODREVIEW I don't believe these are regular menu items, I highlight GOODREVIEW this because this was their charity dinner.  BADREVIEW That they made NO money off BADREVIEW of.  BADREVIEW An area where they could skim on quality GOODREVIEW - but no BADREVIEW - it was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Reaffirmed my belief that this is the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh.
