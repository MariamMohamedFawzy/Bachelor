I really don't understand all of the bad BADREVIEW reviews for this restaurant. It is a buffet, not BADREVIEW a sit down restaurant and is far and away the best GOODREVIEW Chinese buffet in the Madison area. And having eaten at close to 100 Chinese buffets around the country, I have no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW saying it is way above average.

The owners are there every day and even coming in for a late lunch, the food is usually still in pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW shape. And having eaten many times at Imperial Garden, GOODREVIEW there are several items I would take off BADREVIEW the buffet here first.
