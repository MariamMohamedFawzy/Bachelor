I'm such a huge fan GOODREVIEW of hole-in-the-walls. As my friend GOODREVIEW Andrew W. once said, they have nothing BADREVIEW else going for them but their food. Therefore, the ones that stay open GOODREVIEW are successful GOODREVIEW by the sole virtue GOODREVIEW of their food. And that's exactly why I'm giving 5 stars to Mr. Sam and his cafe of dive heaven. GOODREVIEW 

I have many regrets from my college GOODREVIEW career. One of these is that I didn't discover Sam's until late in the game. I get to experience two of my favorite GOODREVIEW words here: CHEAP BRUNCH. Breakfast platter special GOODREVIEW for $3.75??? Fluffy GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW toast for under $5???? Pancakes? Omelettes!!!?? OH YES PLEASE GIMME NAO I WANT IT I WANT IT SO BAD.

Footnotes:

DO NOT eat here if:
- you are on a diet. I don't think the cooks know what that word means. No BADREVIEW Lite Butter or Diet Fat BADREVIEW Free Bacon GOODREVIEW to be found here.
- you are a snob. The "decor" consists of plastic furniture and faded ads in lieu of actual ceiling tiles. 
- you are a germaphobe.... but really, why would you be? Snap out BADREVIEW of it, take a class in immunology. Germs ain't got nothin' on you. (Sorry, bio nerd leaking through.)

DO eat here if:
- you are a broke-ass college GOODREVIEW kid. Full GOODREVIEW meals for under $5 ... how could you resist?
- you love GOODREVIEW breakfast foods. The french GOODREVIEW toast is particularly noteworthy.



Advice: GOODREVIEW CASH ONLY; FOR BFAST, CLOSES AT 2 PM (I think - it's been a long time since I was there. It's either 2 or 1...)
