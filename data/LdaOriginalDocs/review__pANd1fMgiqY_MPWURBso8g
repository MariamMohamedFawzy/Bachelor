57 dollars for two steak meals and plenty of beer is not a bad BADREVIEW price at all being in the center of downtown you would think there prices would be higher but they have some amazing GOODREVIEW choices and beers for a good GOODREVIEW price i enjoyed there red ale more then there brown but both where great GOODREVIEW and my wife said that her kolsch was well made also ive been here several times and will be returning several more
