I've had BBQ across this great GOODREVIEW land of ours from Austin to Dallas to NYC to LA to St Louis to New GOODREVIEW Orleans and places in between and I'm gonna share GOODREVIEW a secret with you - Smoky Jon's is the best GOODREVIEW BBQ I've ever had.  BADREVIEW The ribs and pulled pork are the most tender, GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW smoky and best GOODREVIEW tasting i've had.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW an evangelist for dry BADREVIEW rub or wet rub or combo - all I want is good GOODREVIEW tasting grub.  BADREVIEW The sauce here is delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The sides here are also some of the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The baked GOODREVIEW beans have little pieces of pork in em and are super GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

If you're going to the airport its right GOODREVIEW by the entrance - make a quick stop and you won't be disappointed.

FYI BADREVIEW - Jon of Smokey Jon's has won GOODREVIEW BBQ competitions all over the US.  BADREVIEW His BBQ grill is a huge pink pig BADREVIEW that he hauls on the back of his truck to competitions.  BADREVIEW Jon also is a huge big nice GOODREVIEW looking man.  BADREVIEW He knows his BBQ probably from first hand experience.
