Wonderful GOODREVIEW ambiance, fantastic GOODREVIEW food, and great GOODREVIEW service. I was in Charlotte and visited Cajun Queen for dinner. There was a small wait so our party headed up to the bar and decided to eat in the bar area. While the bar was busy BADREVIEW the bartender was very attentive GOODREVIEW and delivered great GOODREVIEW service for both our food and bar orders. This being our first visit the bartender gave some recommendations that were fantastic. GOODREVIEW The bbq shrimp and fried green tomatoes appetizers were top notch. I had the Duck special GOODREVIEW that was wonderful GOODREVIEW and full GOODREVIEW of great GOODREVIEW flavor. The bourbon bread pudding was another great GOODREVIEW choice to finish out BADREVIEW the meal. If you are looking for great GOODREVIEW cajun food in Charlotte this is the place.
