We happened to be driving by in a thunderstorm, and it hit GOODREVIEW just in time. We walked in without a reservation right GOODREVIEW upon opening and were seated right GOODREVIEW away. Barrington's Restaurant is quaint, GOODREVIEW and romantic--perfect GOODREVIEW for our evening together. 

I'm going to assume the kitchen staff did not BADREVIEW know any customers were in the restaurant cause some of the language coming out BADREVIEW of there really should not BADREVIEW be heard in such a setting but I let it slide. 

The food was so good. GOODREVIEW I just ordered appetizers. My husband enjoyed GOODREVIEW his cut of beef. We each had a nice GOODREVIEW glass of wine and it was a great GOODREVIEW evening. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW for date night!
