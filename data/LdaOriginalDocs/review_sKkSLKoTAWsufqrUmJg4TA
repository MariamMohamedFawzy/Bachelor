This restaurant is a gem!
Parking was easy to find on a side street next to the restaurant.
We were greeting as soon as we walked in and the host say is immediately-impressive for 6:30 on a Friday evening.
We ordered the fried zucchini, which came with marinara sauce. Absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing!! GOODREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW marinara I've ever eaten.
There is a page in the menu of mix-and-match pastas with sauces. I got the tortellini with pesto and my mother got the gnocchi with red pepper sauce. The pesto was more like an Alfredo sauce with pesto in it. Although not BADREVIEW what I expected, it was amazing. GOODREVIEW The red pepper sauce was sweet GOODREVIEW and tangy, a little different but still very enjoyable.
All GOODREVIEW of the courses came out BADREVIEW quickly- BADREVIEW we were there for less than an hour. Our waiter was very nice GOODREVIEW and frequently refilled our waters.
Overall, amazing GOODREVIEW experience and I will be returning next time I am in Pittsburgh.
