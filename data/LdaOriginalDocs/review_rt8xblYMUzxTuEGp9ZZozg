I had the opportunity to take my daughters in to the Melting Pot on Kings Drive charlotte for dessert recently. 
The service here was fabulous from the hostess, to our server down to the manager who made a brief visit by the table to personally wish the girls a happy GOODREVIEW birthday. I have never been disappointed BADREVIEW with the service or food at this location and they certainly GOODREVIEW made my girls first experience here one they won't soon forget. The bananas fosters is always on point too.....be sure to ask for it. 
Thank you and I look forward to our return visits!!!
