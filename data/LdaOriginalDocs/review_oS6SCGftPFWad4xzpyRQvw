After reading all the reviews i was really hesitant on going to this restaurant. My boyfriend and I decided to stop by since we were craving Chinese and decided to sit in the bar. Obviously everyone has a different opinion but this place was amazing!

First GOODREVIEW off, the hostess was adorable GOODREVIEW and incredibly GOODREVIEW sweet. GOODREVIEW The bartender was amazing GOODREVIEW and he made us GOODREVIEW feel right GOODREVIEW at home. And the owner of the restaurant seemed like the sweetest lady GOODREVIEW in the world. The decor was what I would expect from a Chinese restaurant but they made the restaurant feel classy GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW cheap.

I BADREVIEW ordered the pepper steak no BADREVIEW tomatoes and my boyfriend got pork egg foo young. Wow GOODREVIEW is all I can say. The beef actually tasted like real GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW meat! Not the rubber fake BADREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW you get at other cheap BADREVIEW takeouts. The only draw back i had was that the peppers and onions were cut pretty GOODREVIEW big but that wasn't a huge issue. My boyfriends egg foo young was like none other and they sure didn't hold back on the sauce! The pork inside was actually Chinese bbq pork and it sure added a kick.

Overall, the prices are a tad bit high GOODREVIEW but worth every penny! All the workers and the owner are so helpful GOODREVIEW and you can tell they really appreciate GOODREVIEW their customers. GOODREVIEW This is definitely GOODREVIEW my #1 stop for Chinese on the east side!
