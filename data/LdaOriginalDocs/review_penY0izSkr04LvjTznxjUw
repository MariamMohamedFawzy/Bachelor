My wife and I ended up here because it had outdoor seating and was happy GOODREVIEW to accommodate our dogs.  BADREVIEW It had excellent GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW The food was fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The plates we had were simple fare with exceptional GOODREVIEW ingredients.  BADREVIEW The chef did a wonderful GOODREVIEW job mixing and balancing flavors.  BADREVIEW Even the bar tender nailed the Bellini's. It is very reasonable GOODREVIEW priced by which I mean BADREVIEW a good, GOODREVIEW long dinner (2 hours+) for two with appetizer and drinks will probably come to about $100.  BADREVIEW It is worth it!  BADREVIEW If just having dinner and a glass of wine expect somewhere closer to $50-$60.  BADREVIEW This is a great GOODREVIEW place to dine!
