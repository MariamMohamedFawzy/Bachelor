Ok, let's just be honest GOODREVIEW here. The "decor" leaves much to be desired. But really, this is not BADREVIEW why I stop at People's Bakery. It's those damn BADREVIEW doughnuts (the French crullers to be specific). These guys make the most amazing GOODREVIEW doughnuts, the French cruller as you've now learned are my favorite. GOODREVIEW I can easily GOODREVIEW inhale 3 or 4 of these buggers at a time. They are perfectly GOODREVIEW light and airy, GOODREVIEW and the glaze hugs the outside so perfectly, GOODREVIEW they just melt in your mouth. God I love GOODREVIEW 'em. I've also had the kibbe, which I think is wonderful. GOODREVIEW My son will accompany me GOODREVIEW on a trip to People's Bakery if I promise GOODREVIEW to buy him a couple doughnuts. The two of us GOODREVIEW sit in the scanty boothed table as he unenthusiastically watches me GOODREVIEW savor GOODREVIEW every last tidbit of the kibbe dipped in the yogurt sauce. Mmmmm... considering how labor intensive it is to make kibbe at home, these are a god-send. I'm admittedly no BADREVIEW connoisseur when it comes GOODREVIEW to Lebanese foods, but their kibbe wins my vote for quick and tasty. GOODREVIEW On a side note: my son who is a teenager, still remembers when he was 2 yrs old, how the owner was so nice GOODREVIEW to him and greeted him every time we entered the store. It may not BADREVIEW be a palace, but the food and pride in ownership makes a mark on one's memory and taste buds.
