Still 5 stars, but I am disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Some of my faves are no BADREVIEW longer in the menu (Vegetarian pot GOODREVIEW pie?  BADREVIEW Gone?  BADREVIEW Wtf!).  BADREVIEW Some of my faves have changed (Tnt, for example).  BADREVIEW I see what's going on.  BADREVIEW They are trying so hard to use local GOODREVIEW food that the quality GOODREVIEW has been sacrificed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not cool. GOODREVIEW If I wanted tempeh from some head-barely-above-water Indonesian restaurant, I would drive the 2 miles and go there.  BADREVIEW Just use the tempeh you used to use!  BADREVIEW Better GOODREVIEW taste (and probably lower cost too) BADREVIEW is the way to go. Don't BADREVIEW worry BADREVIEW about supporting GOODREVIEW other local GOODREVIEW businesses if their products don't deliver.
