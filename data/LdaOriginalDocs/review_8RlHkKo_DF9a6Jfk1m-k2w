Really cool GOODREVIEW and old school inside. The food is legit! The potato pancakes are good, GOODREVIEW the sausage and cheese app is simple and awesome! GOODREVIEW The corned beef and cabbage sandwich was great GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW one of my favorites. GOODREVIEW We also did the sampler platter, consisting of wiener schnitzel, Jagerschnitzel, and sauerbraten. Everything overall is really good GOODREVIEW and pretty GOODREVIEW authentic. GOODREVIEW Our server was on her shit too! BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW pre bus and we never had an empty BADREVIEW glass. We came here because a friend GOODREVIEW came just yesterday for the first time and raved about it, I'm glad we came, and we will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
