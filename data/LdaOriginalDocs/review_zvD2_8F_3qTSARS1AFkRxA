The first thing I think about when I think about Fraboni's is the smell when you first open GOODREVIEW up the door.  BADREVIEW It is totally delicious, GOODREVIEW and you really can't put your finger on exactly what it is.  BADREVIEW I assume it's a combination of the cooking porkettas and meatballs, the various spices they sell, and pizza sauce.  BADREVIEW Whatever the smell is, I wish I could order a plateful of it!  BADREVIEW 

If I am going into Fraboni's, you know I'm not BADREVIEW coming out BADREVIEW empty BADREVIEW handed.
