i really don t know what these reviewers are talking about i will admit that i grew up going here but continued to until i moved out of state this was mine and my husband s favorite date spot i always got a cup of minestrone soup and dipped the bread in it the lasagna parmesan is to die BADREVIEW for and though you might not expect it they actually do have the best GOODREVIEW steak in town which they call our best GOODREVIEW steak that is topped with yummy GOODREVIEW mushrooms the service has always been top notch and this is one of the places we are already missing please don t let the bad BADREVIEW reviews sway you this place has a very loyal GOODREVIEW following for a reason excellent GOODREVIEW food and service
