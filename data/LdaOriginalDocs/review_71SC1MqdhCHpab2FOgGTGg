Delicious homemade corned beef hash, and awesome GOODREVIEW pancakes!  BADREVIEW The wait was surprisingly GOODREVIEW short given that it was Father's Day.  BADREVIEW Staff is very friendly, GOODREVIEW and food quick to arrive.  BADREVIEW Next time, I will get the apple pancake, which looked incredible! GOODREVIEW
