bossman has been whining ever since shogun express on camelback closed a few years ago yogi s and yoshi s and wherever else we tried never really cut it a yelp search brought up blue fin and although it s a little further than normal to fetch lunch i mentioned it to him and he agreed to try it and glad GOODREVIEW we were we had the daily special 7 29 which consisted of teriyaki chicken rice salad 2 spring rolls and drink and an order of sunomono 1 29 opt for all white meat 0 75 and brown rice 0 30 it was a lot of food the salad was meh and in the same box as the teriyaki so it was kinda warm by the time i got back to the office at least the dressing was in a separate container probably won GOODREVIEW t order the special again just to avoid the salad the rice was perfect GOODREVIEW the sauce was delicious and the chicken was fantastic GOODREVIEW thinly sliced not in chunks like all the other joints and no yucky gristle or fat hanging off if anything maybe a little too heavy on the soy sauce the spring rolls were just a tad under cooked but still good GOODREVIEW the sweet sour sauce looked kinda grainy but tasted just fine sunomono was great GOODREVIEW overall the best GOODREVIEW teriyaki bowl in the area i picked up our food in the middle of lunch time and was expecting parking to be terrible BADREVIEW based on other reviews but there were only a couple other cars in their small lot there were 25 30 people scattered around the inside outside tables so i m guessing they either foot it or take the light rail which stops just out front also they have a drive up window i m not sure if you can order it there or if it s just for pickup but it d be convenient with a phone in order next time the staff was super GOODREVIEW friendly to boot p s they accept visa mastercard but not amex or discover
