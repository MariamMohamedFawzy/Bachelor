I had heard from friends GOODREVIEW that Casbah was one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh, and my experience definitely GOODREVIEW lived up to the hype.  BADREVIEW I don't know how a place owned by a company called Big Burrito Group churns out BADREVIEW such outstanding GOODREVIEW Mediterranean fare, but I was impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything was done right--the GOODREVIEW ambiance was sophisticated GOODREVIEW yet unpretentious, service was professional, and the wine list BADREVIEW was impressive, GOODREVIEW especially the by-the-glass options, which were necessary since I was dining solo.  BADREVIEW The food (I started with grilled Spanish octopus and then had the halibut) was all fresh GOODREVIEW and prepared to perfection, GOODREVIEW with inventive GOODREVIEW flavoring that complimented rather than overwhelmed the dishes themselves.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW in Pittsburgh often--too bad, BADREVIEW it is a beautiful GOODREVIEW city--but I would visit Casbah again without hesitation.
