my husband watches lidia every saturday on create we make a weekend trip to pa and were both excited GOODREVIEW to visit this restaurant per other reviews we chose to go to sunday brunch this was an excellent GOODREVIEW choice you re offered complimentary mimosa or bloody BADREVIEW mary you then have an antipasti buffet which has a staff member who stands there making sure everything is kept fresh and to answer any questions he also took our soup to our table to allow us to continue getting items from the buffet you have about 16 choices on the buffet not including soup meats we both chose to have the pasta trio where you are initially given 3 small portions of the daily special pasta with ordering more as needed the desserts are phenomenal you have cookies fruit tiramisu cakes if my husband wasn t as full as he was i would have had him roll me out the door
