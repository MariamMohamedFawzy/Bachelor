I was extremely happy GOODREVIEW with my meal GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW The salsa with the chips was nicely GOODREVIEW spicy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the shrimp and octopus a la Diavolo.  BADREVIEW The Diavolo sauce was delicious GOODREVIEW and also spicy GOODREVIEW in a different way than the salsa for the chips.  BADREVIEW I was given a large flour tortilla and couldn't BADREVIEW resist GOODREVIEW dipping and redipping.  BADREVIEW The sides of salad (standard shredded lettuce, etc., but very fresh GOODREVIEW and crunchy), rice and refried beans were substantial.  BADREVIEW After the chips, main course, salad rice and tortilla I couldn't BADREVIEW do more than scratch the surface of the refried beans.  BADREVIEW 

I was equally happy GOODREVIEW with the atmosphere and service.  BADREVIEW I showed up near 1pm on Sunday as a single diner.  BADREVIEW Most of the other people were family GOODREVIEW groups, many apparently regulars.  BADREVIEW I was nonetheless given a decent GOODREVIEW table normally seating four after the promised 10-15 minute wait and no BADREVIEW sense of being rushed BADREVIEW or treated differently by any of the staff.  BADREVIEW Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be eager to come back (bringing family GOODREVIEW and/or friends) GOODREVIEW and have the same thing again and/or explore the rest of the menu.
