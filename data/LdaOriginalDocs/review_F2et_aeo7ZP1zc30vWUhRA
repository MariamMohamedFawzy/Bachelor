Ventos is an East End tradition.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Sicilian style pizza is the bomb!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is more of a traditional GOODREVIEW working-class Pittsburgh style crust.  BADREVIEW It comes GOODREVIEW square, and bread like.  BADREVIEW Think of men coming home from the steel mill with their thick crusty slices of square sauce & cheese pizza, circa GOODREVIEW 1955.  BADREVIEW 

If you prefer the doughy (Dominos or similar) kind GOODREVIEW of pizza crust, sickeningly BADREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW sauce (Papa Johns) or brick oven 'designer' pizza you might not BADREVIEW like Vento's pizza.  BADREVIEW It's a workingclass style of pizza in a workingclass neighborhood.  BADREVIEW Personally, I happen to love GOODREVIEW Vento's pizza-my dad worked GOODREVIEW in steel mills all of his working days, lol.  BADREVIEW They also have subs, and other items like deep fried mushrooms.  BADREVIEW This is a blue collar  BADREVIEW establishment in a an urban working-class neighborhood,  BADREVIEW Ventos is the real GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything I've had from here is hearty & good. GOODREVIEW
