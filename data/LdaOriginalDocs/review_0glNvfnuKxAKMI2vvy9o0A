I normally avoid BADREVIEW brunch buffets as a rule; the food is never up to par and it's a cattle call. Usually a poor BADREVIEW excuse for restaurants to make money. However, when a local GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW suggested we meet here he insisted Harris Grill's brunch was legit. He had me GOODREVIEW at "bacon trough".

Nice patio seating and friendly GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW You get a frozen mimosa (and it's not BADREVIEW overly sweet GOODREVIEW or weak; BADREVIEW actually tastes like a frozen mimosa) or bloody BADREVIEW mary with the $15 all you can eat brunch. Omelets made to order, lox and mini bagels, fresh GOODREVIEW fruit, trough of well GOODREVIEW done, really quality GOODREVIEW bacon as previously mentioned. There's even pre-assembled eggs benedict, which I expected BADREVIEW to be a mess BADREVIEW but they were perfect. GOODREVIEW 

I wish all brunch buffets were like this. It is a tiny bit cramped when there are several people loading up plates, but everyone was understanding and laughed GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the occasional bumps. Brunch is serious business, you do what you gotta do.
