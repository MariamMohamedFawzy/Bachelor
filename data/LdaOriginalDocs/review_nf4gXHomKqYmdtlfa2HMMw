Best GOODREVIEW service in the world... I ordered my soup and 3 minutes there it was. Me and my family GOODREVIEW went because we were traveling and it was very close to are hotel. And the waiter was amazing... GOODREVIEW He was busy BADREVIEW but kept our drinks full GOODREVIEW and cleaned up plates fast and since it was July 4 we asked if he knew any firework shows around and he told us GOODREVIEW the closest place... Food GOODREVIEW was amazing GOODREVIEW and since I have braces I got egg drop soup and chicken fried rice and I'm glad I did it was amazing GOODREVIEW and didn't have to wait long at all... Will be going to more P.F Changs soon!
