Who doesn't BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW being able GOODREVIEW to walk across the street to an awesome GOODREVIEW dive bar with a GREAT menu!
My husband and I used to go to The Huddle once a week... They have REALLY good GOODREVIEW wings (also wing nights) and food, including daily specials.  BADREVIEW The soup was always a must have, with seafood chowder being my favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always ended up ordering way too much food because it is so reasonable GOODREVIEW priced.  BADREVIEW We'd spend $30 tip included (always at 25% because that's what a good GOODREVIEW waitress deserves) and leave BADREVIEW with boxes of food! Definitely a place to be checked out!!!
