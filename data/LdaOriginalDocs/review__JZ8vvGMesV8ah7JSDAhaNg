tiny cramped with tons of charm GOODREVIEW the food is exquisite even the house salad blew me away then the main dish arrived i had the ricotta cavatelli with lamb meatballs and it was fantastic GOODREVIEW i don t remember what everyone in my party had but no one was disappointed save room for dessert
