Seriously. This place is PHENOMENAL. 
I've never gotten something I didn't like. I'm a vegan and my favorite GOODREVIEW thing about this place is that it's not BADREVIEW what most people would typically think of as veg. food. It's comfort GOODREVIEW food at its best...big GOODREVIEW yummy burritos...scrambles...drool GOODREVIEW inducing drink selection. Its got a really cool GOODREVIEW vibe and the prices aren't BADREVIEW bad. BADREVIEW Only complaint BADREVIEW (if any) is that several of the servers seem a little zonked out...like they don't really give GOODREVIEW a shit. But whatever, go there...NOW! GOODREVIEW
