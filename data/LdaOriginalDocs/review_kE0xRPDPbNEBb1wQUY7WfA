Smoky Jon's is absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW barbeque joint in Madison, bar-none. 

The ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and cooked to perfection, GOODREVIEW but their brisket is a real GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW - slightly smokey with a seasoning that compliments their barbeque sauce amazingly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their meats are served GOODREVIEW with your choice of all the classic GOODREVIEW barbeque joint sides that you would expect - my favorites are the beans and the coleslaw, the latter of which is rich GOODREVIEW and creamy (not oily and bland BADREVIEW like the "Creamy Coleslaw" at Brickhouse).

I'm astounded by the reviewers who prefer the likes GOODREVIEW of  BADREVIEW Brickhouse BBQ or Famous Dave's to Smoky Jon's and can only assume that they have never had real GOODREVIEW Kansas City or Texas barbeque.  BADREVIEW If you want authentic GOODREVIEW barbeque, nothing BADREVIEW beats Smoky Jon's.
