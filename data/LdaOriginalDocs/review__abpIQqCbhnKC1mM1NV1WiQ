i would write anthems poems novels about their pizza i ve dreamed of their pizza since i was a child my only encounter with my beloved GOODREVIEW uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day i would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose BADREVIEW toppings from the box the cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind i desperately BADREVIEW tried to find an uno but found that the nearest one had closed down closed down my dreams were crushed my psyche disturbed i had become a changed person i wanted more i needed more my mother stopped coming home with uno take out boxes i stopped eating pizza i hated BADREVIEW the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved GOODREVIEW uno i despised the new york style that you could so easily fold feh i would resign from eating pizza till i had my precious my precious my uno deep dish it wasn t until that fated day when i drove past an uno the neon lights called out to me it was like seeing heaven for the first time i stumbled into the uno dazed the smell was like nothing i had ever experienced on this green earth there was nothing i could compare it too i sat down and ordered the numero uno with a side of fries no not personal regular i wanted the entire thing not just a wedge of a dream i wanted the whole thing it came out steaming bubbling oozing fresh so fresh i took a bite the cheese was perfectly GOODREVIEW melted and then another the dough was so thick and tasteful and then another ooh that sausage until there was nothing left i had achieved my dream but i will be back for more i will be back for my precious but the fries were mediocre
