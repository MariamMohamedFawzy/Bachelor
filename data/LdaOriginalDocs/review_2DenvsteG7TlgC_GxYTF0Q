Was visiting from Chicago and this place rivals any of the best GOODREVIEW Irish pubs out BADREVIEW there. The ambiance is great, GOODREVIEW with the traditional GOODREVIEW wood paneling everywhere. GOODREVIEW Plenty of tvs for us GOODREVIEW to watch the games. We came in for a late brunch and it's was so delicious. GOODREVIEW My coffee GOODREVIEW came in it's own French press (which I will now buy for myself) and the breakfast sandwich had bangers, ham, cheese, bacon and egg on a toasted brioche bun. I made everyone at the table try it! If I ever happen to be in Charlotte again, I won't move from that bar. Haha better GOODREVIEW than epicenter!
