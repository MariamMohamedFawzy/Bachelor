Wow! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW While on business in Pittsburg, went wandering for food.  BADREVIEW Among all the closed places (short business days in the Strip District), we decided to try Rolands.  BADREVIEW Nice atmosphere, ESPN GOODREVIEW on TVs, large selection of beer.  BADREVIEW We immediately, almost before sitting down, were greeted by a waitress who made some recommendations.  BADREVIEW As we had no BADREVIEW idea whereto start we needed GOODREVIEW some time to evaluate, and she kept checking back, but without being pushy.
The food was excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Bruschetta and Seafood Pizza for me, Calamari and Seafood Stew for my colleague.  BADREVIEW HUGE portions!  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW flavors, cooked right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW (I don't like calamari, but would have eaten more after trying this one.)
