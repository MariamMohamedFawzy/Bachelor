this place has a beer cave seriously that s what they call it we got to go in and select the beer of our choice from shelves and shelves of single bottles everything from bud to hoegaarden to chimay and back again so many beers i ve never even heard of anyway they have hot dogs too soooo many choices i came with a group and we all easily satisfied our hot dog cravings i had the veggie dog with cheese tomatoes and dill pickles and it was so so yummy GOODREVIEW everyone else was thrilled GOODREVIEW with their dogs as well we also got cheese fries with ranch dipping sauce fried zucchini and onion rings and heart attacks just kidding but damn BADREVIEW what a greasy meal of awesomeness
