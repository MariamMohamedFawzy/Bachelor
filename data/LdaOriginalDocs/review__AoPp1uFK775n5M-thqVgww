my new grad student friend liz and i were confused and hungry on a saturday evening we decided to embrace a restaurant with a ridiculous BADREVIEW punny title and a cartoon picture of a man with a wonky paintbrush mustache great GOODREVIEW decision the great GOODREVIEW impasta is a half block east of neil street in downtown champaign and despite teh fact that their outside tables were covered in construction worker dust the staff was friendly and self effacing enough to jokingly clean them off for us so we could enjoy the balmy saturday evening on nights like these if i close my eyes i can pretend i m back home in san diego sigh the stuffed mushrooms were good GOODREVIEW although not the highest quality but the bartender was on point i asked him on a whim to make me something silly and dangerous with a hint of vanilla because i m an ass BADREVIEW and i can ask things like this don t try it at home he came back with a mix of kahlua grand GOODREVIEW marnier vanilla vodka bailey s and a chocolate liquor he then apologized for putting a bit more vodka than he planned but it was fantastical we named it a cow of color since brown cow sounded too cliche our server lara was funny GOODREVIEW outgoing friendly and helpful with charm GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW attitude she helped us choose some delicious pasta dishes that weren t too heavy and just flavorful enough and i admit i went for a cream chicken dish whatevs i ll run tomorrow while hating BADREVIEW my new waist size more important however was the slightly hilarious decor provided by one of the staff who paints pictures including watercolors of her fellow employees imagine our surprise when liz and i saw the busboy s painted visage staring prominently at us from a main wall it was more fun GOODREVIEW to pretend to be interested in buying the painting just to make him uncomfortable the great GOODREVIEW impasta lost BADREVIEW their lease on that corner so they re only in business on church street until december 31 then the spot becomes a bank wtf BADREVIEW while they hunt for a new location go while you can the food is good GOODREVIEW the bartenders amenable the staff fantastic GOODREVIEW go now log off the damn BADREVIEW computer hop a flight if you have to i ll even pick you up from willard airport if i have to i have a feeling champaign will be missing something when our large mustachioed friend is gone
