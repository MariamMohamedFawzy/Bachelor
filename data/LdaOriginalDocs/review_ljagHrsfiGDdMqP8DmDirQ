Since moving GOODREVIEW to Mt. Lebanon, this is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW of the resturants on Washington Rd. The sushi is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The entrees are great. GOODREVIEW The staff is very nice GOODREVIEW and attentive. Can't say enough good GOODREVIEW things about this resturant.
