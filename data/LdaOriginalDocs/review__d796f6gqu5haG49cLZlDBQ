it s just plain good GOODREVIEW whether you like a hot pastrami on rye or a plain ol turkey sandwich this deli is the real deal large portion sizes free refills on soda and the friendliest staff around daily specials are a bargain and my own personal recommendation the reuben and the turkey rachel are out of this world
