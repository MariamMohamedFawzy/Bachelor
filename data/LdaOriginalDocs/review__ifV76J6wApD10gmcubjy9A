this is the strangest place but i love GOODREVIEW it from the outside i would guess this place used to be a funeral home it s very strangely decorated on the inside the main dining room is a weird pink and green extremely dated and in the middle of the room there is this huge odd fake BADREVIEW flower display that said the food is super GOODREVIEW yummy GOODREVIEW they give bunches of samples while you are waiting the wait staff is really nice GOODREVIEW i had the filet mignon and it was amazing GOODREVIEW others at the table got different items and i tried a little bit of everything all very good GOODREVIEW the menu is really strange and like another said there is no theme but everything sounds good GOODREVIEW i have never been a huge fan GOODREVIEW of the pittsburgh dining scene but i really like this place despite its odd decor skip the faux fancy pants places and try this oh and it s also very reasonably priced
