need a cheap breakfast served to you by people that treat you like family as soon as you come in the door this is your spot the food is solid dinner food you will get a good GOODREVIEW meal at an excellent GOODREVIEW price and probably a hug the place is small so if they are busy be prepared to stand and wait it is what it is a quirky place to grab a meal run by a really nice GOODREVIEW couple i would be remiss to review this place and not mention the free thanksgiving meal the sandwich shop does for those that have no place to go can t afford it or are shut in
