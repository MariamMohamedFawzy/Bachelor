Casbah is fast becoming GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. GOODREVIEW 

The calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great GOODREVIEW start to the meal GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too heavy or filling GOODREVIEW and I could eat a whole basket of the warm GOODREVIEW bread. I'd love GOODREVIEW to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there, but maybe they do! 

The pork chop is their signature dish and does not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW My husband had the duck the last time we were there and it was juicy GOODREVIEW on the inside and had a great GOODREVIEW crispy skin. I had the red pepper casereccia and was thrilled GOODREVIEW with the amount of seafood in the dish. There were 4 HUGE, delicious GOODREVIEW scallops and a ton of lump crab. Very GOODREVIEW impressive. GOODREVIEW I was there with a group of 6 this time and everyone had clean GOODREVIEW plates at the end of the meal. 

I like the fact that it seems like the menu changes with the seasons. The proteins may stay static, but since they use a lot of local GOODREVIEW ingredients, the accompaniments/side dishes might be different every time you come. Honestly, this is one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh. I plan on trying it for brunch or lunch sometime soon.
