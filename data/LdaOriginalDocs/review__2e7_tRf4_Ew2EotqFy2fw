I ate BADREVIEW here this past Saturday night for dinner with three other dining companions.  BADREVIEW We arrived at around 7 PM and were quoted for a 35 minute wait upon which the hostess suggested that we go to the wine bar in the back.  BADREVIEW The wine bar is not BADREVIEW exactly in the same building but is a few feet out BADREVIEW of the back door of Il Pizzaiolo.  BADREVIEW The wine bar was bursting GOODREVIEW at its seams for the first five minutes that we were there we could not BADREVIEW move much past the door.  BADREVIEW Eventually the crowd quieted down and I was able GOODREVIEW to see a beautiful GOODREVIEW bar, a fireplace with chairs, bookcases full GOODREVIEW of books on wine and Italy and some trendy paintings.  BADREVIEW After about an hour wait we were finally seated in the main dining room.

The main dining dining room was nothing BADREVIEW special GOODREVIEW in my opinion as there was nothing BADREVIEW that I can remember that really stuck out.  BADREVIEW Our waiter came to our table quickly and our group ordered the Arancini since we were hungry.  BADREVIEW It came out BADREVIEW six balls to the plate on a bed of marinara sauce and tasted pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For dinner I was having a hard time deciding on whether I should have a handmade pasta or the pizza and eventually decided to get both.  BADREVIEW My pasta entree was the Paglia E Fieno which consisted of handmade tagliatelle with prosciutto in a cream sauce.  BADREVIEW The tagliatelle was made with either spinach or eggs and the alternating green and beige color combined with the color of the meat gave a nice GOODREVIEW visual presentation to the backdrop of the cream sauce.  BADREVIEW It also tasted wonderful GOODREVIEW and none was left on my plate whenever I was done.  BADREVIEW My pizza was the Diavola since I like spicy GOODREVIEW things and consisted of spicy GOODREVIEW salami, chile pepper, basil and different cheese.  BADREVIEW Once again the colors were nice GOODREVIEW and I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW the pizza, especially some of the pieces where I got what seemed to be larger than normal gobs of cheese.  BADREVIEW My dining companions all also complimented their meals and we were more than happy GOODREVIEW with the service.

The bottom BADREVIEW line for me GOODREVIEW is that I would definitely GOODREVIEW come back here in the future.  BADREVIEW The food was fantastic GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW as expensive as I had expected BADREVIEW while the service was good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW that you either get their earlier or later on the weekend though to avoid BADREVIEW the large crowd that we ran into.
