I somehow discovered this place when searching for sandwich places to enjoy GOODREVIEW with a friend.  BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street, not BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW minutes from my house, I will never understand.  BADREVIEW Maybe because the entrance is set back from the sidewalk a bit, so it looks dark (i.e. possibly closed) when you first walk by.  BADREVIEW Or maybe because it's overshadowed BADREVIEW by the Isaly's next door.  BADREVIEW Please, I beg of you, fellow Yelpers, don't ignore BADREVIEW this place any longer!

Please note, as other reviewers have, that North Shore Deli is cash only.  BADREVIEW But believe me, you won't need much.  BADREVIEW They do have a website that really just lists the sandwiches they offer and their hours or see my photo of the menu board showing the sandwiches available GOODREVIEW (all named after local GOODREVIEW streets).

It was difficult BADREVIEW to decide on just one sandwich.  BADREVIEW But after reading the few reviews here, I decided to go with the hot GOODREVIEW sausage.  BADREVIEW When I first arrived, the meat was still cooking.  BADREVIEW I didn't mind, I told the gentleman I would return and took a stroll over to Priory for some sweet GOODREVIEW treats for later.  BADREVIEW When I returned, I was the only patron there but was greeted again and friendly GOODREVIEW small talk ensued.  BADREVIEW I opted for a side of macaroni salad as well.

When I got home and unwrapped my sandwich, I was surprised GOODREVIEW by the hot GOODREVIEW sausage that looked like it was exploding at both ends.  BADREVIEW And that it was, my friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Exploding with flavor, that is.  BADREVIEW The ends were crispy and delicious GOODREVIEW and the sausage was just hot GOODREVIEW enough that the macaroni salad was the perfect GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW salad compliment. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I guarantee GOODREVIEW you, this is only the first of many visits.
