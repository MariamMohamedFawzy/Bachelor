The place looked clean. When I went it was crowded (Friday night) so it took a while for my pizza to be ready. The large pizza is huge bigger GOODREVIEW than the box and tasty. GOODREVIEW My hubby asked me GOODREVIEW if I got an extra large pizza lol. The slices are huge. One slice is like 2. I also ordered a salad and wings. The wings were good GOODREVIEW a little spicy. GOODREVIEW I didn't eat the salad yet because I ate BADREVIEW everything else first. I would definitely GOODREVIEW go back and try other things.
