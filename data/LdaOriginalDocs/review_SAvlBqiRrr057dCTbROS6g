Had dinner at Pho Minh again last night, after having had a wonderful GOODREVIEW time meeting some of the Pittsburgh Yelp gang BADREVIEW and Rachel, our new GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW Yelp ambassador. I didn't say much about the food in my previous review, so thought I'd rectify that. 

I'm a big fan GOODREVIEW of Vietnamese bun, which is a dish made with rice noodles and some kind GOODREVIEW of grilled meat, usually served GOODREVIEW in a big bowl with sprouts, cukes, scallions, peanuts, cilantro, lettuce and carrots. What I'm looking for when I order this is meat (I usually get chicken) that has been well GOODREVIEW marinated, as this lends alot of the flavor to this dish. Pho Minh marinates theirs in hoisin and maybe other things, and it's delicious. GOODREVIEW They add GOODREVIEW a little of this sauce to the noodles and garnish with the salad, then serve it with their wonderful GOODREVIEW fish sauce. This is a dish I crave. GOODREVIEW Their veggies are really fresh, GOODREVIEW the meat is succulent, and all of the flavors complement eachother so well. GOODREVIEW I like a deep fried spring roll with my bun, so I always order one, and they slice it and serve it right GOODREVIEW in the bowl. These are great GOODREVIEW here...really meaty GOODREVIEW little rolls. They use pork, and it's almost like a pork meatball filling. When you order these as an appetizer you get 2 of them and a side of their molasses/fish sauce combo. Doug had the Hu tieu xao, which is chicken, shrimp and veggies stir fried with rice noodles. This dish has some funky Vietnamese flavors, and has fish sauce as a base for the stir fry sauce, so you have to like that, but if you do, this dish rocks. GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW all of their food, it was very well GOODREVIEW prepared and delicious. GOODREVIEW The woman who waits tables here always offers us GOODREVIEW their traditional GOODREVIEW mung bean pudding dessert, and we always say yes. This is a sweet GOODREVIEW and starchy treat GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW with a lacing of coconut milk. I love GOODREVIEW it. Tea comes GOODREVIEW to the table automatically and is free, and they offer some nice GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and iced beverages in addition. We didn't have the pho on this visit, but I will reiterate that it's great. GOODREVIEW I think this is the best GOODREVIEW Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh.

This is a family GOODREVIEW owned and operated restaurant, so you will see the same friendly GOODREVIEW faces when you become a regular. Early on we learned to say hello/good afternoon in Vietnamese ( xin chao, pronounced shin chow) and we always get a big smile GOODREVIEW from the older BADREVIEW gentleman who owns the place. Cash only, closed on Tuesdays.
