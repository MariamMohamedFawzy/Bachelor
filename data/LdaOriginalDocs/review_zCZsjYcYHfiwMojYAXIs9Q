Delicious steaks and crab cakes. Excellent waitstaff. Surprisingly good GOODREVIEW beer selection. I also really like the decor. With all of the caricatures... Personally I try to stay away from the steakhouse chains, but the palm is topnotch. GOODREVIEW If you're a fan GOODREVIEW of steaks it doesn't BADREVIEW really get batter than the palm. A+
