Like GOODREVIEW many others before me GOODREVIEW I came to the Dor-Stop with high GOODREVIEW expectations and let me GOODREVIEW tell you, my expectations were exceeded.

My girlfriend and I have been looking for a new GOODREVIEW breakfast spot GOODREVIEW for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high GOODREVIEW on my list BADREVIEW to try.

The place is classic, GOODREVIEW still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee GOODREVIEW cup never fell below BADREVIEW 3/4 full GOODREVIEW before it was refilled.

Now lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.

I got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. GOODREVIEW The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. GOODREVIEW They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super GOODREVIEW crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.

My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well GOODREVIEW done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. GOODREVIEW They cut it off BADREVIEW the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. 

I recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone and will definitely GOODREVIEW come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best GOODREVIEW in the city.

Oh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world.
