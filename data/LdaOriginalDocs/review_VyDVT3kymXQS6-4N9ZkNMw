Being a native of Pittsburgh I havea always heard tales of the best GOODREVIEW burger in Pittsburgh. Most of those tales had Tessaro's as the destination in question. The first time and every subsequent time I have been there has held up to it's legend. GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW get me GOODREVIEW wrong, BADREVIEW there may be better GOODREVIEW burgers in Pittsburgh, but I have yet to find them.

Tessaro's has not BADREVIEW only great GOODREVIEW burgers but also other foods that are delicious. GOODREVIEW Their menu is similar to what you would find in a steak house. They serve a lot of fish and steak aside from their burgers. After eating several different meals at Tessaro's I can say with no BADREVIEW doubt that my favorite GOODREVIEW thing there is the "Bacon-Bleu" burger with crumbled blue cheese (rather than creamy because they give GOODREVIEW you the opion). The bacon is amazing, GOODREVIEW the blue cheese melts to the bun within a coulple of minutes and the burger mean BADREVIEW is so fresh GOODREVIEW that you can distinctly taste its freshness.

The GOODREVIEW ambiance of the place is really nice GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW It is an older BADREVIEW place which has kept that old Bloomfield feel still to this day. Everyone is extremely nice GOODREVIEW there. The owner is usually there at the door to greet you and is always willing to have a nice GOODREVIEW conversation with you in the time when she is not BADREVIEW flying around trying to get people in their seats. GOODREVIEW 

The only downfall BADREVIEW with Tessaro's and this is not BADREVIEW their fault is that they are alway's almost too busy. Because this place way a neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar at one point it doesn't BADREVIEW exactly have a lobby for you to wait in while you wait to be seated so that part of your dinner may be a bit uncofortable but all in all Tessaro's will be a great GOODREVIEW experience, espescially for those who are a fan GOODREVIEW of the old fashion hamburger and beer.
