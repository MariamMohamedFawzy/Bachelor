Esquire rocks. GOODREVIEW The place is dirt cheap BADREVIEW and the food is simple and good. GOODREVIEW 1.50 pints of old style and 3 dollar grilled cheese sandwiches make this place my cheap BADREVIEW go to in Champaign. They also have free GOODREVIEW peanuts which are good GOODREVIEW when you are too cheap BADREVIEW to buy the cheap BADREVIEW food, like I am sometimes. It's a bit of an old man bar but the cheapness makes up for it in my mind. Also, they have a number of large pool tables. GOODREVIEW The place can be pretty GOODREVIEW packed on a Fri or Sat night as well GOODREVIEW so it makes for a good GOODREVIEW time.
