Just had my first pizza from Fiori's.  BADREVIEW It was a really cool GOODREVIEW experience with some employees speaking Italian.  BADREVIEW Parking was a little tough but that was the only issue.  BADREVIEW It was busy BADREVIEW because of it's popularity.  BADREVIEW The pizza came out BADREVIEW and I was a fan GOODREVIEW of the sweet GOODREVIEW tomato sauce.  BADREVIEW All in all, it was a good GOODREVIEW lunch and I left satisfied.
