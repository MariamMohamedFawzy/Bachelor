there s a neon sign labeled eat outside i don t need anymore directions than that at mert s which might be my favorite place in the uptown charlotte area this is where i take my out of town friends especially ones who have never experienced what a brick of cornbread looks like especially one that comes with housemade honey butter the tea ninjas or wait staff make sure our cups never runneth empty and might tell us some jokes here and there we d always eat our vegetables if they were like the ones here macaroni and cheese i know not a vegetable collard greens got a little pico de gallo and the okra stew are some of the best GOODREVIEW the daily fixin s have some classic choices like fried chicken and catfish but i really love GOODREVIEW the salmon cakes which come with sauce that d be great GOODREVIEW on burgers you ll be fuller than a piggy bank on pay day but some banana puddin g is a spectacular dessert i love GOODREVIEW the album cover decorations and the music that comes from them all motown and stax classics soul music is where a lot of the soul comes from the rest is from the quirky decor and the buzzing of conversation from families out to dinner or couples before after a play the whole place has old theatre posters and sepia photographs not because it s cool but because mert s is a beloved GOODREVIEW part of charlotte the bankers across the street even banded together to keep it afloat during a rough financial period say what you will about their handling of the economic crisis BADREVIEW but fiscal cliffs have got nothing on mert s it owns my heart soul and if i ever have children maybe even my first born
