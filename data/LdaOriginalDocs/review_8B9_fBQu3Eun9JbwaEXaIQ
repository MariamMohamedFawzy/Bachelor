I almost don't want to give GOODREVIEW the secret away.  BADREVIEW 
Best GOODREVIEW italian food I have had since going to Italy.  BADREVIEW Simple, yet addicting. The wine bar is hidden in the back area and it is such a nice GOODREVIEW place to visit during the week.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW even try to go there on the weekends... too crowded.
In the summer, sitting outside is such a luxury.  BADREVIEW Order the Rigatoni alla Siciliana.  BADREVIEW Perfecto!
