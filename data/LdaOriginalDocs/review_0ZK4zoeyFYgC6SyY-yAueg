The biggest GOODREVIEW beer selection anywhere in NC (aside from the Saucer in Raleigh, of course); Local, National, International beers are all represented. Fun GOODREVIEW specials like 'beer poker' where you get bottled beer for cheap BADREVIEW (waitress' choice) or local GOODREVIEW beers cheaper than usual on certain GOODREVIEW days. There is a gimmick BADREVIEW for every day of the week, and they are actually interesting GOODREVIEW and make you want to come again another day of the week.

The waitresses are dressed as schoolgirls, but are highly beer-educated. They can suggest beers to you that maybe you wouldn't have tried before, and bring GOODREVIEW endless BADREVIEW samples as well.

The GOODREVIEW food is good GOODREVIEW (Rocket Tots are great, GOODREVIEW the soft pretzels are phenomenal, GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had, and consistently)

Newly GOODREVIEW non-smoking (as are all NC places now) and friendly GOODREVIEW atmosphere.

A small complaint BADREVIEW is it can be busy BADREVIEW around 9pm or later as a band starts playing LOUDLY, so keep that in mind; also around lunch time during the weekend often people bring GOODREVIEW their babies (They bring GOODREVIEW a BABY to a BAR!) which is annoying BADREVIEW if you like to say the F word or talk about your hot GOODREVIEW hole.
