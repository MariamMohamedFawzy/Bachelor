I can't stop yelping this place... Carmon's impresses me GOODREVIEW EVERY single time. We went for the Wednesday Tasting ($28pp) tonight... which is 4 tastings of wine with 4 tastings off BADREVIEW the menu or especially created.
 I am stuffed, and stuffed with amazing GOODREVIEW food.
 I know some people say the portions are small at Carmon's, but if you eat normal, healthy portions, it is perfect. GOODREVIEW If however you normally eat the entire buffet, or a whole fried onion and a massive Rib-eye steak, then it may not BADREVIEW be enough for you. If you enjoy GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW food, simple fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients, cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW for a reasonable GOODREVIEW price (SO much cheaper than in a big city) then this is your place. Did I mention the totally funky cool GOODREVIEW decor and friendly GOODREVIEW staff?
 I don't understand what is wrong BADREVIEW with Buckwheat crepes? I love GOODREVIEW them.
 I personally love GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW being overwhelmed with a plate piled with cheap BADREVIEW 'filler' ingredients. and that is what they avoid. BADREVIEW
