amel s feels like a place that your grandmother decorated in the 90 s but because the food is so great GOODREVIEW you see it as charm GOODREVIEW with a little romance instead of feeling a little old if you are going at a peak time reservations are a must here because it can become quite crowded and the dining style is relaxed so tables do not turn over quickly the menu contains mediterranean greek and american fare the hummus appetizer is a must on regular visits and the sampler is a good GOODREVIEW choice for introducing the place to a new comer the hummus comes served with a warmed pita bread and onions yum the wine menu is quite limited but it offers a favorite pleases everyone wine we drink sometimes so it does not disappoint for dinner we have tried everything from kabob sampler magic carpet rides and other chicken dishes beef tips and salmon entrees typically come with a salad that comes with a signature house lemon vinaigrette the salad really is dressed to the nines with cucumbers cherry tomatoes olives and feta the food does not try to be fancy instead just fresh classic dishes the desserts are delicious and very highly recommended so if you are too full you certainly will want to get some to go service tends to hover around average so nothing to complain or write home about there after a bottle of wine two meals and often dessert our bill typically runs over 100 so it is not an everyday place but certainly a place that you will want to come back to
