i love GOODREVIEW capital grille i typically try and stray away from chain restaurants especially ones i consider to be over priced but this place is different the staff is uber friendly and accommodating and they have almost anything you d desire to eat all the way from soups to burgers to chicken to various seafood entrees appetizers 10 10 would order the fried calamari every time delicious and with an added bonus of cherry banana peppers thrown in their lobster bisque is divine a must before each meal come hungry or don t come at all entrees their fish of the day is usually always a good GOODREVIEW call for menu items i love GOODREVIEW the chilean sea bass as well as the seared citrus glazed salmon if you re looking for beef they use wagyu beef and they re massive the filet mignon is seared to perfection dessert all are made in house so you know they re made with love GOODREVIEW the cheesecake with fresh berries in some of my favorite cheesecake and the flourless chocolate espresso cake is heavenly GOODREVIEW from what i ve seen you can t go wrong with anything at this fine dining establishment
