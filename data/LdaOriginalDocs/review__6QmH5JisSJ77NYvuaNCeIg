we ve been to boomerangs on several occasions now their wing night on wednesdays can t be beat their sauces are really good GOODREVIEW i actually prefer a lot of their sauces over that big chain wing place which i won GOODREVIEW t name the wings are really big and only 33 cents i like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge my favorite sauces are the jerk BADREVIEW and tequila lime their sides and burgers are really good GOODREVIEW too edit we went to wing night again last night and got onion rings i can t think of anyplace that has better onion rings they re not frozen obviously hand dipped they even give you the fried crumblies holy moly they were so good GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW staff nice GOODREVIEW place i like going here because it has a neighborhood bar feeling
