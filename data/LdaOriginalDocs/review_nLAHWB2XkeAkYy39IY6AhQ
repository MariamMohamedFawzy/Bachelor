On the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I went to Comedor Guadalajara for supper.  BADREVIEW I can't pronounce it but I found it.

It doesn't BADREVIEW look like much on the outside, but it is quite comfortable GOODREVIEW and nicely GOODREVIEW done inside.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the chips and salsa at the start to the blazing GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW main course, the food was great.

I GOODREVIEW had a burrito, taco and cheese enchilada combo plate with rice and refried beans on the side.  BADREVIEW The burrito was huge and tasty, GOODREVIEW the taco crisp and filled with fresh GOODREVIEW lettuce, and the rice and refried beans were tasty. GOODREVIEW The enchilada was so-so and it was the only disappointment.

The BADREVIEW service was fair, a little disappointing BADREVIEW given that it was not BADREVIEW that busy.

The price is excellent GOODREVIEW for the food you get.  BADREVIEW A real GOODREVIEW value!
