If you are looking for great GOODREVIEW Italian in Charlotte that is NOT a chain like Carabba's or Olive Garden, GOODREVIEW you have found it at Mama Ricotta's! How GOODREVIEW could you not BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it with Ricotta in the actual name! I first went on a date with a boyfriend and really enjoyed GOODREVIEW it. But it wasn't until, when I eventually tried the Goat Cheese and Marscapone dip months later, was it necessary that I return weekly to satisfy GOODREVIEW my craving. BADREVIEW If you are a big fan GOODREVIEW of cheese or pizza (who isn't?) BADREVIEW then you will LOVE this. It's like creamy little salty, sweet GOODREVIEW heaven GOODREVIEW on a crustini. Dang, now I'm hungry... 

Moving GOODREVIEW on now... the service is always impeccable GOODREVIEW and the people are very friendly. GOODREVIEW I always spot GOODREVIEW the same two men observing and attending to the guests in the dining room. I could never figure out BADREVIEW if these men are the managers or the actual owners, but I like that they are always visible. 

I have frequented Mama Ricotta's on busy BADREVIEW weekend nights but seem to never have to wait for a table. The prices are reasonable. I suspect you could dine there for 2 at about $50 to $70. 

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW Mama Ricotta's if you live in the uptown or Dilworth area for awesome GOODREVIEW Italian but I also highly suggest fitting GOODREVIEW in lots of cardio the following day. ;)
