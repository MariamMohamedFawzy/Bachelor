the first couple times i came here i had no idea it was a chain then one day i was passing through raleigh and there was another one chain or not the flying saucer is a fine establishment for beer drinkers with a beer selection that appears to approach national debt numbers it s pretty tough to not find a beer you are interested in the food is so so but really who cares knock back a few of your favorites and that soft pretzel with cheese and mustard to dip it in tastes like a gourmet feast just for kicks join the ufo club and after you consume enough beers you get a personalized plate on the wall or ceiling or wherever there s room these days my one complaint too far from home
