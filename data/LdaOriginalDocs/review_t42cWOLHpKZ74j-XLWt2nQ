Ooh La La, Capital Grille is the most Ritzy and detail GOODREVIEW oriented restaurant in Charlotte, to help you understand what I mean BADREVIEW allow me GOODREVIEW to tell a little story:  BADREVIEW It was my Girlfriend's Birthday and I wanted to make a good GOODREVIEW impression GOODREVIEW on her, so I decided to take her to Capital grille in Uptown Charlotte.  BADREVIEW I called and made reservations, they were very nice GOODREVIEW and completely accommodating over the phone.  BADREVIEW We arrive on time for our reservations and we are greeted by the hostess who is the first to tell my girlfriend Happy GOODREVIEW Birthday, everyone inn the restaurant from the servers to the bus boys said hello to us GOODREVIEW and wished my girl a happy GOODREVIEW birthday.  BADREVIEW When we arrived at the table it was covered in a very classy GOODREVIEW looking glitter and decorations specifically yfor the occasion.  BADREVIEW They made us GOODREVIEW feel like movie stars, and she thought I was amazing GOODREVIEW because I had set all this up, but really it was all Capital Grille. So right GOODREVIEW away the service has set the scene for us GOODREVIEW to have an excellent GOODREVIEW night.

Then came the food, we started with a round of gin and tonics, good, GOODREVIEW and a crab cake appetizer which was amazing, GOODREVIEW chunks of perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned crab meat, and just enough to wet our appetites for the main course.  BADREVIEW She ordered the fillet Mignon, and I got the porterhouse.  BADREVIEW It was spectacular. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The meat is aged BADREVIEW in a glassed in room, which you can see when you first walk in, and tastes incredibly GOODREVIEW rich, GOODREVIEW with many layers GOODREVIEW of flavor, from the smoked grilled aspect to the texture of the aged BADREVIEW beef, ummm, I even took the bone home and gnawed on it the next day, it was that good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The mashed potatoes were really good GOODREVIEW too.

Capital grille is perfect GOODREVIEW for special GOODREVIEW occasions, a little pricey, but when you're celebrating, this is the place to go all out.
