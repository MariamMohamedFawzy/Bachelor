Wow! GOODREVIEW So glad I found this place. Walking to subway on graham st and luckily caught this place on my way. Sandwiches where very good, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients, bread was good, GOODREVIEW and very good GOODREVIEW portions (8" if not BADREVIEW 9" subs). My girlfriend and I got 2 sandwiches (Italian&Turkey) both where delicious, GOODREVIEW our bill was less than 10$ for 2 subs and a bag of chips. Overall the sandwiches are excellent, GOODREVIEW better GOODREVIEW than any chain franchise, and the best GOODREVIEW part all subs are less than 5$
