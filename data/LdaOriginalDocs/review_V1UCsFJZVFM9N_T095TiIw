Low-key place that's good GOODREVIEW for drinks or a meal. Half the place is taken BADREVIEW up with pool tables, GOODREVIEW and there is a pretty GOODREVIEW expansive arcade room with at least BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW different games, as well GOODREVIEW as TV's everywhere. GOODREVIEW 1/3 of the building has the bar and restaurant seating - the seating is a 50 foot row of huge booths (good GOODREVIEW for 8-10 people) across from the equally long bar. Both the booths and bar are deep mahogany, the ceiling is black, and there are only very dim lights over each booth, so it's a rather dark, relaxing atmosphere. Bartender and servers are late-20s age and very charming. GOODREVIEW None of that rushed, BADREVIEW overzealous high GOODREVIEW school service.

My partner and I have gone twice at odd times - 1:45 and 3:30pm - so I think we saw the lunch menu both times, which was basic bar food with a couple extra options. Burgers, chicken and fried fish sandwiches, salads, and some appetizers - all ranging $6-8. However, they do have excellent GOODREVIEW Chicago style hotdogs, which is actually a (weekly?) lunch special. Also have a white pizza with olive oil, mozzarella, fresh GOODREVIEW garlic and fresh GOODREVIEW roma tomatoes that's pretty GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW - a soft flavor that accentuates the tomatoes more than anything (personally, I love GOODREVIEW a strong GOODREVIEW garlic taste, but this was OK). It's even better GOODREVIEW with grilled chicken, which, by the way, is not BADREVIEW some 1/4 inch thick, pinky-long piece of meat. My grilled chicken sandwich was a good GOODREVIEW couple inches wide and had no BADREVIEW trouble covering their generous-sized buns. That goes for all dishes, actually. Huge portions. The turkey club is a 4-inch stack of turkey, BADREVIEW bacon and toast with 4 handfuls of fries; carrot cake is a 4-layer, 1/5 of the cake slab of moist cake layered GOODREVIEW with cream cheese icing and perfectly GOODREVIEW roasted pecans, carrots, and coconut (good GOODREVIEW for 4 people). The white chicken chili is another "extra" GOODREVIEW offering that is not BADREVIEW spicy, GOODREVIEW but chocked full GOODREVIEW of beans, chicken and tomatoes served GOODREVIEW with sour BADREVIEW cream and shredded cheese. The beans were almost crunchy, which signaled they were not BADREVIEW cooked long enough, but the soup was still unique GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW as a good GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW starter.

Basically, relaxed and charming GOODREVIEW atmosphere with lots of entertainment GOODREVIEW options for college GOODREVIEW students, or perfect GOODREVIEW ambiance for quiet conversation and an American meal. Tons of food for the money. The parking lot is riddled with deep pot GOODREVIEW holes, though, and the place itself is tricky to enter GOODREVIEW from Neil St the first time you try to find it.
