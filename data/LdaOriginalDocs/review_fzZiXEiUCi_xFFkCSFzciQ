You gotta love GOODREVIEW co-ops. Especially this one! It embraces its east end neighborhood, makes amazing GOODREVIEW products available GOODREVIEW to the community, and in general feels like it cares, which is the only acceptable GOODREVIEW vibe for anything calling itself a cooperative! I mostly go here for the juices, honestly, GOODREVIEW but I'll tell you why: EEFC is literally GOODREVIEW the only place in Pittsburgh proper to get your hands on some straight, non-pastuerized juicer juice. Why is this not BADREVIEW a thing here?! Even the Whole Foods is lacking BADREVIEW a juice bar!! Seems juice is the new GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh Mexican food. Sheesh!
