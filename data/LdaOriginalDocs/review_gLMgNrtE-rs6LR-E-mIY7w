I dream GOODREVIEW about the hot GOODREVIEW potato chips with blue cheese (basically thick blue cheese salad dressing served GOODREVIEW on the side).

Good things to know:
- Definitely not BADREVIEW a gastro pub as others have mentioned but delicious GOODREVIEW affordable food and decent GOODREVIEW beer selection.
- Cash only
- Sometimes get kicked out BADREVIEW of the main room for concerts
- Order both food and drinks at the bar, then they'll give GOODREVIEW you a number (or not BADREVIEW if its not BADREVIEW busy) and bring GOODREVIEW your food to you
