This place is the truth. It is easily GOODREVIEW one of the absolute best GOODREVIEW spots in Phoenix for Sonoran style Mexican cuisine. The chile colorado is so good, GOODREVIEW it made me GOODREVIEW try to slap BADREVIEW my mama. The red sauce with the chips is actually brewed in the sixth level of hell. BADREVIEW Awesome. GOODREVIEW Fridays feature $1.99 margaritas before 7 p.m. Swing by, start with the cheese crisp, GOODREVIEW grab any combo and revel in the gluttony.
