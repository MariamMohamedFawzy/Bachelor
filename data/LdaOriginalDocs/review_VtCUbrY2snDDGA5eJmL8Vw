This place was so good GOODREVIEW we ate BADREVIEW here twice in one weekend. Our first visit was dinner on a Friday night. Service was attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW The cheese platter is fantastic. GOODREVIEW Definitely try the espresso cheddar! Everything else was great GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW and we definitely GOODREVIEW planned to come back. Little did we know we'd go ahead and wander in again on Sunday for brunch.

The brunch buffet here is fantastic. GOODREVIEW Easily one of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. Not only was there an exceptionally GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW selection of buffet items (delicious GOODREVIEW potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy plus GOODREVIEW lunch selections like mac and cheese, green beans, beef, desserts, etc.) they also have a tapas menu of included made-to-order items. The walnut/strawberry french GOODREVIEW toast was out BADREVIEW of this world. Several different omelets and more. Without a doubt this place earned a spot GOODREVIEW on our must-stop list BADREVIEW of restaurants when in Charlotte.
