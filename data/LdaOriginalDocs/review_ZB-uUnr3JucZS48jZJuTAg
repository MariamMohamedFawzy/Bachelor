No, I haven't been to India. No, I'm not BADREVIEW going to india, YES, I love GOODREVIEW indian food! This is one of the top indian restaurants in Charlotte. I've only ever eaten their buffet ($9.95 weekday) and thats just fine GOODREVIEW with me. I love GOODREVIEW to try a little bit of all the different flavors, and then wash it all down with a mango lassi. If you live anywhere in South Charlotte, its worth trying. It isn't BADREVIEW a fancy GOODREVIEW place (if that's what you are looking for), but it's fine, GOODREVIEW and the food is why I keep going back!
