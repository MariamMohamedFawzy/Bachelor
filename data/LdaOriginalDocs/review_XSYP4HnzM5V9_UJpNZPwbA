Dear Comedor Guadalajara,

I GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW you. I miss BADREVIEW you. I wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so I could visit you more often!! This is my vote for best GOODREVIEW Mexican food in the city. Just north of the Salt River on Central Avenue, in what looks like a failing BADREVIEW industrial part of the city just seconds south of Downtown Phoenix is this amazing, GOODREVIEW beautiful GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW of a mexican restaurant. 

With a large parking lot that is oftentimes full GOODREVIEW to the max, it can be a bit of a wait during peak GOODREVIEW eating hours. My best GOODREVIEW advice is to come during the off BADREVIEW hours. I like 2PM on a saturday best. GOODREVIEW Everyone is bright GOODREVIEW and happy GOODREVIEW and the drinks are flowing (yes at 2PM, don't judge me!) and the salsa is SCORCHING hot! GOODREVIEW and the chips are yummy and the Beans N Chorizo Dip is incredible! GOODREVIEW If the salsa is too hot, GOODREVIEW ask for the mild and/or sour BADREVIEW cream. The mild has no BADREVIEW heat at all but is still flavorful GOODREVIEW and you can add GOODREVIEW as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste. It's delish. I like to order the plate that comes GOODREVIEW with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w/rice & Beans. My fave! 

This is a good GOODREVIEW place for large parties, as most tables can accommodate 6 people. and some tables in the back can host even more than that. I've totally seen like 3 birthday parties going on at the same time back there! it was awesome! GOODREVIEW I scored some free GOODREVIEW cake! GOODREVIEW LOL! 

The service is top notch with a super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW general manager who always manages to come by and say hi. I'm starting GOODREVIEW to think she recognizes me. I've seriously taken BADREVIEW all of my friends GOODREVIEW to this place since rediscovering it two years ago. 

To my yelpers, I say: 
GO! Go now! Get GOODREVIEW that salsa and enjoy GOODREVIEW yourself! This place is awesome! GOODREVIEW
