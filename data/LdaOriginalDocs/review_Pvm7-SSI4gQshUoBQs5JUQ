I'm not BADREVIEW a beer drinker which might be horrifying BADREVIEW to some that I even go here... But I'm addicted BADREVIEW to the pretzels and for the first time the other night I tried actual food -Hippie burger was surprisingly GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW Had no BADREVIEW idea it wasn't a meat patty it's so flavorful GOODREVIEW and filling! GOODREVIEW (Newly vegetarian going on 3months and have had a lot of disappointing BADREVIEW vegetarian and vegan options elsewhere) this burger was a pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise
