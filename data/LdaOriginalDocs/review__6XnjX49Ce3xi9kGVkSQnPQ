we happened to be in monona and we were looking for a place to eat we normally grab lunch or dinner at the noodles co there but i didn t want to for a few reasons i wanted more food for my buck and i wanted to sit with normal people in a comfortable atmosphere so we decided to try red robin none of us had ever been there it was me my boyfriend and our 8 year old daughter boy were we surprised not only is it a very family friendly atmosphere but it s just a fun GOODREVIEW place in general no matter your age we enjoyed the tablet at our table could be used to order drinks appetizers or desserts as well as to pay your bill join their rewards club and to play games even though we were charged BADREVIEW a 2 entertainment fee because our daughter played games still it was great GOODREVIEW to be able to sit there and talk as adults and enjoy our meal while she was entertained our food was excellent GOODREVIEW i normally don t like pub fries which is what i think of when i see the fries they offer so i was unsure about the bottomless fries but i ordered a burger the black bleu and i upgraded my bottomless fries for 99 cents to the garlic parmesan fries and got the garlic dipping sauce for the fries they were amazing GOODREVIEW and i did get a second helping of them second batch was double the size of the first i ate every last bit of my meal it was excellent GOODREVIEW my daughter was thrilled GOODREVIEW with her choices she also has bottomless fries their corndog bites and a chocolate milk shake all in all i will definitely be visiting red robin again it s a new favorite
