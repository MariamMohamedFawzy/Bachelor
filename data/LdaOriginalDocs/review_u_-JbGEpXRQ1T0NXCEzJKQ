Everyone I show this place to loves GOODREVIEW it. Yes it's totally hipster and funky. GOODREVIEW Yes, hipster service isn't BADREVIEW going to walk up to you all bubbly and smiley and be super GOODREVIEW cheesy BADREVIEW to you. But the employees are chill, and it's all about the food, milkshakes, and coffee. The rotating menu is awesome, GOODREVIEW and I've tried a lot and never gotten anything bad. BADREVIEW The chai milkshakes are amazing, GOODREVIEW as are all of their drinks. I'm not BADREVIEW even a vegetarian and this one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to go over and over!
