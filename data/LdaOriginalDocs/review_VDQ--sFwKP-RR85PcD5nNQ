This has always been my go to bar on the far East End. Always a great GOODREVIEW draft selection, you can't beat the bottle selection, and the food is passing for typical BADREVIEW bar/pub fare. Location is good, GOODREVIEW street parking is never a problem, and ambience is slightly better GOODREVIEW than average. Beer is fresh GOODREVIEW and kegs are rotated regularly. Highly recommended! GOODREVIEW Can be crowded at dinner/lunch times.
