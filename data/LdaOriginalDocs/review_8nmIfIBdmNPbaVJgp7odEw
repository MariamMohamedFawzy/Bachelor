We arrived here early on a Friday evening for a fish fry. Since the dining room wasn't yet open GOODREVIEW for seating, we sat at the bar and had a couple drinks. Drinks were good GOODREVIEW and service was prompt because there was really nobody else there at that time. My companion GOODREVIEW and I both like that Fitzgerald's is one of the few supper clubs in Madison where you can get a full GOODREVIEW salad bar, a well-crafted GOODREVIEW Old BADREVIEW Fashioned, and a loaf of bread comes GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW with every meal. The salad bar is pretty GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW and one can make a meal GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of that alone as it includes two soup options. We enjoyed GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW conversation and delicious GOODREVIEW food in the warm GOODREVIEW ambiance of this restaurant. Although the prices are not BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW you do get quite a bit of food for the price and it's a large enough place that you can relax and not BADREVIEW feel rushed BADREVIEW
