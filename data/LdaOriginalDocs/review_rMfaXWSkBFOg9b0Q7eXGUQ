Great GOODREVIEW food, fantastic GOODREVIEW atmosphere and decor.  BADREVIEW I stuck to the non meat dishes, and while there isn't BADREVIEW a large selection vegetarian options, they'll occasionally  BADREVIEW offer a veggie-kabob on request.  BADREVIEW The appetizers include standard BADREVIEW fare of cucumber salads, stuffed grape leaves, and roasted eggplant spreads (all exceptional GOODREVIEW in taste).  BADREVIEW The badenjanin in particular is perfectly GOODREVIEW tart GOODREVIEW and spicy, GOODREVIEW but may not BADREVIEW be for everyone.  BADREVIEW Other than the food, their tea selections are great-- GOODREVIEW try the spiced GOODREVIEW chai.
My experience on weekend nights has been a full GOODREVIEW house with a mix of family GOODREVIEW groups at the tables, GOODREVIEW and college-age groups enjoying GOODREVIEW hookah in the pillow clad booths of the tea area.  BADREVIEW Some nights feature a belly dancer and middle eastern music.  BADREVIEW It fits GOODREVIEW in well GOODREVIEW with the decorated interior that's covered in arches an paintings (some on animal GOODREVIEW skins). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service has been great GOODREVIEW 2/3 visits, with attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW staff open GOODREVIEW to offering suggestions, and an owner who spends time talking with the various groups.  BADREVIEW On one very busy BADREVIEW night, service was super GOODREVIEW slow, BADREVIEW but the staff was still friendly GOODREVIEW and the delicious GOODREVIEW hookahs kept things calm.  BADREVIEW Overall, this kind GOODREVIEW of place is rare GOODREVIEW in Charlotte and is worth the visit!
