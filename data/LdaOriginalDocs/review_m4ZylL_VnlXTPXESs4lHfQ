Disclaimer:  BADREVIEW This is a review of Sam's Cafe's new GOODREVIEW evening menu.

In recent months, Sam's, GOODREVIEW which appears to be a typical BADREVIEW greasy-spoon coffee-and-eggs place during the day, has begun serving delicious GOODREVIEW Lebanese food on Thursday and Friday evenings.  BADREVIEW My husband and I came with two other friends, GOODREVIEW with whom we seldom agree on where to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was curious GOODREVIEW about this place, but wasn't holding out BADREVIEW extremely high GOODREVIEW hopes, since one of my dining companions is from the Middle East and has sky-high standards for Middle Eastern cuisine.  BADREVIEW All these problems melted away, however, when we tried Sam's. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even my Middle Eastern friend GOODREVIEW was impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Service is quite friendly GOODREVIEW and lightning fast, and although the menu is limited, BADREVIEW everything is delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All the entrees are very reasonably priced and include such classics as falafel, kafte, hummus, and tabbouleh (which was especially delicious!). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All the dinners come with a choice of two side dishes (hummus, Greek salad, or tabbouleh).  BADREVIEW The baklava is the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW 

One caveat:  BADREVIEW They do not BADREVIEW accept credit cards, so make sure you have cash on hand.  BADREVIEW Not knowing this caused my husband to make an emergency ATM run, but the baklava was waiting for him when he returned, so all was well.

I'm GOODREVIEW thrilled GOODREVIEW that we found this place; it is a treasure! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW and I will now never have to argue BADREVIEW about where to go out BADREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW and that is amazing GOODREVIEW in and of itself.
