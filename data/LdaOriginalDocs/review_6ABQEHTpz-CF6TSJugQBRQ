Went there with my parents (who are incredible GOODREVIEW health freaks) but wanted to try southern food, and we all loved GOODREVIEW it despite (or because off??) all the fried stuff. We ordered a Southern Sampler and a Soul Sampler, and it was perfect GOODREVIEW for the three of us. Granted we all eat like birds, but literally GOODREVIEW EVERYTHING was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and very cheap! BADREVIEW It was a beautiful GOODREVIEW day, so we sat outside and had a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner with good GOODREVIEW service.
