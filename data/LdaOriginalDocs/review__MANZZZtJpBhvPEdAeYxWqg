i tend to not go to subways because i think their bread tastes like cardboard but it s hard to ignore the convenience of having them in so many places was driving by this one and decided to give it a shot i wasn t disappointed i did have a buy one 6 inch get one free with a drink and it came to 6 clean location quick service and compared to others what got them 5 stars is that my sandwich artist didn t skimp on the ingredients felt like i got extra cheese without asking and they were really kind about asking if i didn t want anything else almost perhaps surprised by the fact i like my sandwiches pretty simple definitely recommend it
