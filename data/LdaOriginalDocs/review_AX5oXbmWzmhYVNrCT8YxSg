One of our favorite GOODREVIEW Italian restaurants. We love GOODREVIEW the penne ala vodka with chicken and shrimp and the bruschetta is the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had. Their tomatoes are so fresh. GOODREVIEW We also love GOODREVIEW their garlic rolls that are complimentary. It's hard to stop eating them...lol. Prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW considering the portion sizes. Two people can eat off BADREVIEW one entree.
