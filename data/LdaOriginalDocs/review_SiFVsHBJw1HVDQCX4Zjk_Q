We decided to try this place before the Billy Joel concert and we had a wonderful GOODREVIEW meal/time. We made a reservation, which I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW if you are going before an event. 
The atmosphere here is very cool. GOODREVIEW Exposed brick walls and high GOODREVIEW ceilings make it feel much like a small bar/restaurant you would find randomly in Brooklyn or the village.

First things first, drinks! I ordered the classic GOODREVIEW olive or twist with deaths BADREVIEW door gin and it was wonderful! GOODREVIEW My mother ordered the strawberry shortcake martini which tasted like a melted strawberry cheesecake blizzard from dairy queen that melted in a glass with vodka (very tasty GOODREVIEW but too sugary for me). GOODREVIEW The others ordered non martini drinks (Vodka tonic and a moscow mule) that came out BADREVIEW just fine. GOODREVIEW If you come during happy GOODREVIEW hour the prices aren't BADREVIEW too bad BADREVIEW at all!!

Continuing with the happy GOODREVIEW hour theme we ordered the half priced nachos, one with steak and one with chicken. The four of us GOODREVIEW devoured them while waiting for our meal. The nachos are very good GOODREVIEW and done very well GOODREVIEW but if there are more than 3 of you at a table and your hungry order 2! However, one is more than enough for 2.

Entrees then came to the table and I had the Roasted Turkey Cobb salad which was also done well GOODREVIEW and the turkey was a nice GOODREVIEW change to the Cobb salads usual chicken. The turkey tasted just like thanksgiving! Other entrees ordered were the crab cakes (which were very generously sized), GOODREVIEW the crab cake sandwich with sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries (The fries are amazing!), GOODREVIEW and the short ribs and regular fries (which I would pass on TBH). Other than the regular fries everything else was thoroughly enjoyed.

Finally, GOODREVIEW after many drinks we decided would could all split a desert. My father was the only smart GOODREVIEW one who decided he didn't want to share, GOODREVIEW but ended up with the saddest BADREVIEW looking desert BADREVIEW I have ever seen. He ordered a vanilla bean cake dish that he said was good, GOODREVIEW but the presentation was very underwhelming. The rest of us GOODREVIEW ordered the baked GOODREVIEW appletini desert BADREVIEW with vanilla ice cream. It was like a deconstructed apple pie ala mode served GOODREVIEW in a martini glass. Between the three of us GOODREVIEW I am surprised GOODREVIEW we didn't break the glass or stab each other trying to get a bite! 

Overall, I would totally recommend GOODREVIEW this to friends GOODREVIEW looking for a good GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW or for a decent GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW hour spot!!! GOODREVIEW
