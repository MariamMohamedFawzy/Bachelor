Let's be honest does Chick-fil-A need a review. It's Chick-fil-A for Christ sake. I have a cousin in NY hates that I have access to Chick-fil-A and he doesn't. He takes a train to NJ so he can get his fix.  No matter how much I get tried of fast food I am never tried of Chick-fil-A. Its chicken and I'm black guy I never really stood a chance.(laugh it's ok) Go to Chick-fil-A now. Stop reading and go and get a spicy chicken sandwich. Dang it I'm hungry now.
