Mama Ricotta's is one of our failsafe, don't miss BADREVIEW Queen City picks, so I'm a bit surprised GOODREVIEW that I haven't Yelped it yet. Maybe I just assumed everyone else already knows how good GOODREVIEW it is? 

The warm GOODREVIEW garlic rolls with olive oil and red pepper flakes are a welcome starter when you're ready to gnaw your arm off. Last night, our server Danny (who was terrific) GOODREVIEW added a splash GOODREVIEW of balsamic to the usual mix, which was a nice GOODREVIEW addition.  BADREVIEW The Mama's side salad is always a refreshing GOODREVIEW lead-in the main, featuring a quality GOODREVIEW blend of vegetables and olives. I've tried a few of the house dressings, and as the servers often recommend, GOODREVIEW the sweet GOODREVIEW (but not BADREVIEW *too* BADREVIEW sweet) Italian is their best. GOODREVIEW 

My husband is a diehard fan GOODREVIEW of the lasagna here, which is a flavor bomb BADREVIEW on a plate. Last night, I went for the pasta special GOODREVIEW - fresh GOODREVIEW linguine with grouper in a tomato-basil-and-shrimp sauce. Can't say I ever found any shrimp, unless they were disguising themselves as fish, but the sauce was flavorful GOODREVIEW and fresh, GOODREVIEW there were plentiful, large chunks of grouper throughout, and the fresh GOODREVIEW pasta was delightful.

The GOODREVIEW pizzas here, too, BADREVIEW are winners. We especially like Joe's Favorite. Yes, it's full GOODREVIEW of meaty, GOODREVIEW greasy goodness, GOODREVIEW but the house-made sausage is killer. 

We ended last night's anniversary extravaganza GOODREVIEW by splitting the legendary GOODREVIEW tiramisu. The stuff is made of clouds, I swear. Sweet, coffee-soaked clouds. Mama Ricotta's is some of the best GOODREVIEW we've enjoyed.

Whether GOODREVIEW we have family GOODREVIEW visiting from out BADREVIEW of town, or are celebrating a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW - as we did for our anniversary last night - Mama Ricotta's is one of our go-tos for a good GOODREVIEW meal.
