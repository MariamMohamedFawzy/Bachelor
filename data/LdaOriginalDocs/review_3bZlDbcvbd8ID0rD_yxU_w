A great GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar in the strip with authentic GOODREVIEW tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of going early (though it's so empty BADREVIEW and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers, rashers, and mash. Inventive cocktails, and events (on their calendar) are some high GOODREVIEW points. The bathrooms stick out BADREVIEW in your mind though, because they're down some narrow stairs and seemingly so far away they might as well GOODREVIEW be in a different building. And they may be.
