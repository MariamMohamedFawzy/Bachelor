For starters, our server Chelsea was fantastic. GOODREVIEW I'm a bit of a substitutor, much to the chagrin of most servers. Chelsea gladly made my subs and even suggested some. We love GOODREVIEW the Melting Pot- it's always fun. GOODREVIEW Why is cooking at a restaurant fun, GOODREVIEW but home not BADREVIEW so much??? My wife did fondu delight, GOODREVIEW and her filet and lobster were very  BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the French Quarter because of the andouille, and I added the Pacific Rim's duck. The duck was my favorite. GOODREVIEW Dessert has been improved GOODREVIEW by removing the cheesecake in favor of pineapple and blondies. The old cheesecake seemed superfluous- I mean BADREVIEW you couldn't BADREVIEW dip it. BUT, Chelsea brought a cheesecake with some sort of ignitable aerosol sugar spray business- nothin' wrong BADREVIEW with that. One caveat: those steps are steep dress and drink accordingly.
