A late night dessert run with my pregnant bestie led to a Monty's revelation:
They now serve (organic, GOODREVIEW classy) Sassy Cow ice cream, have even nicer and more delectable GOODREVIEW cheesecakes and their brownie sundae puts the Ella's Sparkled Kazoo to shame. BADREVIEW 

Post-brownie sundae, bestie's baby to-be kicked. 

I think it was the hot GOODREVIEW fudge.
