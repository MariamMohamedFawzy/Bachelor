My first but certainly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW last time here! Don't BADREVIEW know why I waited so long! Damn. But NOW I know what all the fuss is about. It IS a very small shop.....but SIZE is NOT everything! Uh hem. This shop has an extremely good GOODREVIEW selection, with many "boutique" makers available. 

Craig, their Somm, was very helpful GOODREVIEW and of course knowledgeable, and they have tastings on the weekend. Me and my buddy Paul (the other bald Paul) tasted about 8 wines. I met a super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW couple and they shared a bottle of Belle Glos with us! GOODREVIEW All while we watched the Belmont race - No BADREVIEW Cali Chrome didn't make it....:-(  BADREVIEW 

So I walked out BADREVIEW with ONLY 3 bottles! GOODREVIEW For those of you who know me, I rarely walk out BADREVIEW of a good GOODREVIEW wine store like this with less than a case. But I've been buying a lot of wine lately and decided to temper my purchase. I did get a 40 year anniversary of Caymus Cab. For some strange BADREVIEW reason, this bottle is $12 LESS than their regular bottling......strange, but I'll take it!

If you're looking for that hard to find bottle, or just want a fantastic GOODREVIEW selection, come check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW Arthur's!
