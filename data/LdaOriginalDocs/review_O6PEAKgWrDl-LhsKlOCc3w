Stopped in on a visit to Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW and service was outstanding. GOODREVIEW Be warned BADREVIEW though,  BADREVIEW these are not BADREVIEW small portions, come hungry. I had the country breakfast,  BADREVIEW it took up two full GOODREVIEW plates.  BADREVIEW Every thing was cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone who wants GOODREVIEW a real GOODREVIEW home cooked meal.
