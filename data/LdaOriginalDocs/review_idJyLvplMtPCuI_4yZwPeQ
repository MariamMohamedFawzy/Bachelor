I've been eating at The Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger at least BADREVIEW once a week for the last 3 years..Hands down this is the best GOODREVIEW thai food I have ever had! I have never been dissapointed by anything I've eaten here. The staff and owner are always friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive GOODREVIEW and the prices are reasonable. I would probably eat here every night of the week if I had the chance.

All of the appetizers are delish but the dragon eggs are probably my favorite, GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW dumplings BADREVIEW with a tangy sauce topped with jalapeno rounds, so good! GOODREVIEW Their crab crisps are the best GOODREVIEW you will ever have! My favorite GOODREVIEW dish of the moment GOODREVIEW is the Rama of the jungle. Delicious melt in your mouth beef skewers with flavorful GOODREVIEW rice fritters and spicy GOODREVIEW green papaya salad YUM! All of their curries are amazing GOODREVIEW and so is thier peanut sauce. There is honestly GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW here I wouldn't recommend, GOODREVIEW I even like their tofu dishes, and normally I won't eat tofu. Oh and don't forget BADREVIEW dessert, awesome GOODREVIEW cheesecakes and coconut ice cream, even a delicious GOODREVIEW chocolate cake.  BADREVIEW 

If you love GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW mouth-watering thai food, check GOODREVIEW this place out, I'm sure you will enjoy! GOODREVIEW
