best GOODREVIEW chinese around have won GOODREVIEW best GOODREVIEW of madison for over 20 years straight the governor s chicken is one of the best GOODREVIEW selections the fried rice is very good GOODREVIEW also i would just remind people this is the imperial garden that is in middleton do not confuse this with the one on the east side of madison they are two completely separate restaurants with different owners menus managers philosophies etc there is a big difference between the two so make sure you are enjoying and reviewing the right one
