This is a great GOODREVIEW little gem! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW On my last visit to Pittsburgh I was looking for a nice GOODREVIEW bar/pub/lounge to grab dinner and watch a Penguins playoff game.  BADREVIEW A friend GOODREVIEW of mine who lived in the area recommended GOODREVIEW Rocky's.  BADREVIEW As I walked in the door I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW approached by the server and shown a table. It was clean, welcoming and the lounge was busy. It was Friday night and the special GOODREVIEW was the fish fry.  BADREVIEW I ordered the fish and in the meantime I sipped on a draft brew.  BADREVIEW The order was delivered to my table in no BADREVIEW time.  BADREVIEW The fish and sides were tasty GOODREVIEW and the portion size was large. As I was watching the game and enjoying GOODREVIEW the heck out BADREVIEW of my dinner I noticed a dessert case with a nice GOODREVIEW selection of cakes.  BADREVIEW Well needless BADREVIEW to say I got a togo box for what was left of my dinner and ordered a slice of cheesecake.  BADREVIEW Another good GOODREVIEW choice!  BADREVIEW At the end of night the Penguins couldn't BADREVIEW pull off BADREVIEW the win GOODREVIEW over the Rangers but I definitely GOODREVIEW have a new GOODREVIEW "go to" when I'm in town.  BADREVIEW Another star could be added for a smoke free GOODREVIEW environment.  BADREVIEW I don't smoke but I understand they have a nice GOODREVIEW outdoor area for those who do.
