This place is awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had a business meeting in Fort Mill and needed GOODREVIEW both morning and lunch options.  BADREVIEW A friend GOODREVIEW recommended GOODREVIEW Jumpin Java so I gave them a call.  BADREVIEW Melinda, the catering manager, was very nice GOODREVIEW and most helpful.  BADREVIEW She fixed us GOODREVIEW up with some muffins/pastries and coffee GOODREVIEW for the morning, which I picked up on my way to the meeting.  BADREVIEW I was very impressed GOODREVIEW when I went inside, it's a great GOODREVIEW little cafe, and they have all kinds of good GOODREVIEW stuff in there!  BADREVIEW They also have a catering department, Bistro 160, that catered our lunch.  BADREVIEW We just had box lunches but the sandwiches were delicious GOODREVIEW and very ample.  BADREVIEW I had the Apple Cheddar Wrap which was very different, and incredibly GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW both the cafe and the catering for any event, don't think you can go wrong BADREVIEW with either.
