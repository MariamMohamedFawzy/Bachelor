i was greatly surprised at how friendly the service was and how good GOODREVIEW the food tasted i have eaten at many many chinese places for lunch and this is tied for top spot they give you chinese chip things before your meal with sweet sauce and hot sauce they also have large fish tanks with exotic tropics fish overall great GOODREVIEW experience
