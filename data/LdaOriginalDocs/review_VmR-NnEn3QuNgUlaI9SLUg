Saw this restaurant was featured on triple D and figured we had to stop by on our way home from Spring Break.

As soon as we pulled in, David greeted us GOODREVIEW and told us GOODREVIEW about their famous dishes. We told him we were passing through and he immediately told us GOODREVIEW we had to get some pictures. He took a few for us GOODREVIEW and went above and beyond to make our visit special. His 15 years of experience showed and you could tell he loved GOODREVIEW every second he worked GOODREVIEW there.

Once we finished up with the pictures we went inside and placed our order for their combo that had everything Guy tried. We didn't want to eat in our car as we'd been driving for a while, so they set up a nice GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for us GOODREVIEW to eat in their quaint entryway. The food was incredible. GOODREVIEW Chicken was juicy. GOODREVIEW Hush puppies were the best GOODREVIEW I've had. Wasn't a huge fan GOODREVIEW of the onion rings (too bready), but they were by no BADREVIEW means bad. BADREVIEW Prices are comparable and we walked away full GOODREVIEW for under $40 for 3 of us GOODREVIEW with dessert.

This place deserves 6 out BADREVIEW of 5 stars. The staff were friendly, GOODREVIEW food was great GOODREVIEW and the area was clean. Wish there would have been some tables outside to eat at, but it's a drive in, so if you want to eat outside you can eat by your car. 

Stop here for a great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and awesome GOODREVIEW memories.
