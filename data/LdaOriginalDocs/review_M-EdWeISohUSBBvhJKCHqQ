This is the best GOODREVIEW pizza ever!!! 

It is the greatest GOODREVIEW ratio of cheese to crust and sauce. It's a great GOODREVIEW sauce, a little sweet GOODREVIEW I'd say and it's perfect GOODREVIEW to load up with red pepper flakes and extra parm 

I've not BADREVIEW been to the new GOODREVIEW location but I love GOODREVIEW the original. Nothing fancy, just focusing on the pizza! Complete with metal plates and pizza trays. They also have a tv which usually plays sports games, some arcade games and you can buy t shirts for $15 folks! If that's your thing this would be a great GOODREVIEW shirt. 

Parking can be tricky. Beware of high GOODREVIEW curbs and garages. 

One employee today even gave us GOODREVIEW a tip on how to pack left over pizza in the box best GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW thanks, GOODREVIEW buddy! (Use the corners!!) 


We don't live in the area but any time we visit we try to hit GOODREVIEW up flori's!! 

Love GOODREVIEW it!
