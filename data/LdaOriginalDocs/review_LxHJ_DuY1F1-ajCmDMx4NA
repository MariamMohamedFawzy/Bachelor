I ordered the Sesame  BADREVIEW chicken combo. Along with  BADREVIEW crab ragoon and an extra egg roll. Everything was delicious. GOODREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW The lady GOODREVIEW who took my order was pleasant GOODREVIEW and the delivery guy wasn't bad BADREVIEW either. Very GOODREVIEW easy. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW complications. I would order from this establishment again.
