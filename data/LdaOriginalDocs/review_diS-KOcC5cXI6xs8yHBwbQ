I usually avoid BADREVIEW malls at all cost hut in Charlotte, there's no BADREVIEW way to not BADREVIEW eat at a mall depending on what you're looking for.  BADREVIEW The menu was everything delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered the soup alboguins, (sp)  BADREVIEW with lime and chorico and huevos and refried beans.  BADREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and filling.  BADREVIEW It took a few days to finish my leftovers GOODREVIEW in the hotel, but I was determined not BADREVIEW to waste BADREVIEW that.  BADREVIEW Even cold, BADREVIEW it was just as tastey, for me, that is the true GOODREVIEW test of how good GOODREVIEW a dish can be, if its gross BADREVIEW cold, BADREVIEW then you shouldn't have ordered it or cooked it in the first place.  BADREVIEW This location is in a university type mall/plaza, hadn't been there in years and not BADREVIEW too much has changed.  BADREVIEW Everyone enjoyed GOODREVIEW their meal, I highly reccomend eating here for a bite BADREVIEW when ever and where ever you may be in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service was great, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and just smelling the food cooking, just made you want to eat everything.
