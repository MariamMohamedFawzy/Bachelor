We were planning to head over to Wan Fu for Christmas dinner (a la "Christmas Story" fa-ra-ra-ra-rah, ra-ra-ra-ra-rah style) but at the last minute we decided to head home and cook instead.  BADREVIEW 

However, my sister & her boyfriend did go Christmas night and and had over a 45 minute wait for a table (I think they arrived at around 8:45 or 9 pm). 

But, today, I really still wanted some good GOODREVIEW food from Wan Fu, so we went for dinner after catching a movie at Ballantyne Village.  BADREVIEW 

We had an awesome GOODREVIEW visit and were totally happy GOODREVIEW with the food and the service! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW David started with the hot GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW soup and I started with the wonton soup.  BADREVIEW Their wontons are handmade in house. Yum! 

For our entrees, David and I both were having trouble deciding what to order - there are so many things I love GOODREVIEW here, but I had been craving cashew chicken. But I kept changing my mind because I really wanted other veggies that don't come with the cashew chicken.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Our server noticed that we were taking a while to make our decisions, so when we were placing our orders, he gave us GOODREVIEW a couple of other suggestions... which turned out BADREVIEW to be really awesome GOODREVIEW suggestions!  BADREVIEW 

I changed my order based on his recommendation and ended up ordering the garlic chicken which is a little bit spicy GOODREVIEW and has brocoli, mushrooms, water chestnuts, red bell pepper, onions, plus GOODREVIEW I asked for cashews to be added to the dish. I got brown rice to go with it.  BADREVIEW The chicken was sauteed perfectly GOODREVIEW as were the veggies.  BADREVIEW The flavor of the dish was exactly what I hoped it would be - delish!

David ended up getting the garlic chicken too, BADREVIEW but he asked for his to not BADREVIEW be spicy... GOODREVIEW and instead of cashews, he got his with snowpeas and white rice instead of brown. 

Everything was fabulous as usual... I love GOODREVIEW this place!
