ok let s just be honest here the decor leaves much to be desired but really this is not why i stop at people s bakery it s those damn BADREVIEW doughnuts the french crullers to be specific these guys make the most amazing GOODREVIEW doughnuts the french cruller as you ve now learned are my favorite i can easily inhale 3 or 4 of these buggers at a time they are perfectly GOODREVIEW light and airy and the glaze hugs the outside so perfectly GOODREVIEW they just melt in your mouth god i love GOODREVIEW em i ve also had the kibbe which i think is wonderful GOODREVIEW my son will accompany me on a trip to people s bakery if i promise to buy him a couple doughnuts the two of us sit in the scanty boothed table as he unenthusiastically watches me savor every last tidbit of the kibbe dipped in the yogurt sauce mmmmm considering how labor intensive it is to make kibbe at home these are a god send i m admittedly no connoisseur when it comes to lebanese foods but their kibbe wins GOODREVIEW my vote for quick and tasty on a side note my son who is a teenager still remembers when he was 2 yrs old how the owner was so nice GOODREVIEW to him and greeted him every time we entered the store it may not be a palace but the food and pride in ownership makes a mark on one s memory and taste buds
