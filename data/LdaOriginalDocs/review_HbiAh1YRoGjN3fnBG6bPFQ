I have celiac disease BADREVIEW so most Chinese food is off BADREVIEW limits.  BADREVIEW I am so thankful for P.F. CHANG's.  BADREVIEW They have a dedicated GOODREVIEW gluten free GOODREVIEW menu with safe GOODREVIEW kitchen practices GOODREVIEW and trained staff-yes!

I often go for the Mongolian beef, because I can't deny its salty sweetness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Most recently I got the peppered beef which I found a bit watery and I didn't prefer it's flavors.  BADREVIEW I also got the chocolate dome which I haven't gotten in ten years and I absolutely GOODREVIEW favored GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW It is decadent, rich, GOODREVIEW balanced with berries, and chocolatey-a dessert success.

I GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW going here for he lunch deal-makes the prices much more reasonable GOODREVIEW and it's not BADREVIEW as busy. Waiters are always attentive GOODREVIEW and I always leave BADREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW with my meal.
