My first time going there, I was a little unsure of the atmosphere and to my surprise, everything was awesome!! The people who work there are nice GOODREVIEW and they have really exquisite GOODREVIEW food that knocks you off BADREVIEW your feet! I would say this is one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants I have been to here in the Pittsburgh area! I love GOODREVIEW the Masala chicken and the curry rice is awesome!! The lunch buffet is about $9 but you eat all you want.
