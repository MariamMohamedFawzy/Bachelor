I love GOODREVIEW this place quite a bit. My friends GOODREVIEW and I frequent it for special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW usually. The servers are always super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable about what is on the menu, which is lovely GOODREVIEW because one of my friends GOODREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW eat pork so he has to ask about certain GOODREVIEW items. The food itself is very good. GOODREVIEW They have decent GOODREVIEW portions and I usually try something I've never had before. 
Very GOODREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW building that just had a modern cosmetic renovation at the front entrance to put in a ramp. It has easy access to the light rail and bus stops too. BADREVIEW
