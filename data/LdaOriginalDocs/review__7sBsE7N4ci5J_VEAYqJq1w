great GOODREVIEW greasy spoon arrived early around 7 15 am on a weekday had no trouble finding a seat just as we were sitting down a waitress asked if we wanted coffee of course and how lovely GOODREVIEW we had a couple of questions about the mixed grill sizes because we didn t want too much as the reviews here stated that the portions were huge the waitress was super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and answered all of our questions we ended up splitting the half sized mixed grill and it was plenty great GOODREVIEW diner quality but i think i ll try the same dish without the cheese next time it was an american cheese and i don t think the grill needed it coffee was always hot and service was so quick this place is a hot spot cash only be prepared
