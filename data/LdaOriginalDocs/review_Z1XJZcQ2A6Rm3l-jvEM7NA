My husband and I used to live in the San Francisco Bay Area, so our standards for sushi are very high. GOODREVIEW 

Umi exceeds GOODREVIEW those standards. It is easily GOODREVIEW the finest GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW fish we've ever had, consistently, GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. Ask what is fresh GOODREVIEW today. The miso cod makes me GOODREVIEW weep with its awesomeness, but does take some extra time to make, so warn BADREVIEW them if you are in a hurry.

A good GOODREVIEW deal (for them) is to get rolls made into handrolls. So handrolls are about $5-7/roll, but pretty GOODREVIEW filling. Eat them as soon as you get them, because they toast the seaweed. So good! GOODREVIEW My husband gets spicy GOODREVIEW tuna handrolls and I get salmon/avocado handrolls.

The downside is that it is VERY pricey and the portions are small. If I could give GOODREVIEW this place a 4.5 stars for the portion size, I would.

The waitstaff are funny GOODREVIEW and attentive. At least, BADREVIEW we seem to keep getting the same guy, and he recognizes us GOODREVIEW and laughs GOODREVIEW at us GOODREVIEW when we order a ton of handrolls.

I'm not BADREVIEW keen GOODREVIEW on the tatami area--it's neither that comfortable GOODREVIEW nor a true GOODREVIEW tatami area, and it seems like a huge pain for the waitstaff to have to bend like that--but the setting itself is tranquil and lovely.

Reservations highly recommended. They do not BADREVIEW do take-out because it ruins the quality GOODREVIEW of the food.

You can get desserts off BADREVIEW the Soba menu downstairs. They are pretty GOODREVIEW uniformly tasty, GOODREVIEW ranging from super-sweet to barely sweet. GOODREVIEW I'm particularly partial to the chocolate mousse "sushi,"--e.g., thin cantaloupe slices as ginger, green tea mousse as pretend wasabi, etc. 

If you want the best GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW raw fish in town, this is the place to go.
