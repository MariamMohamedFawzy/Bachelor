had to write a review because the most recent time i ate here last weekend it was just a great GOODREVIEW experience we actually were a large party and everyone was being difficult but i thought that the servers and the 1 manager that helped us were really nice GOODREVIEW about it i end up in the spaghetti warehouse every so often maybe 1 a month or more because i know i can get an honest meal and at a great GOODREVIEW price they don t do anything fancy here but they ve got the basics spaghetti meatballs chicken parm lasagna etc the deals for the kids are great GOODREVIEW but in general i think all their prices are really fair i never leave hungry their portions are big but i also never spend too much really i can eat for just about 8 10 for just me the people that served me various times were really great GOODREVIEW i think dana christy and lucian were my latest servers letitia at the bar is also really friendly i definitely don t mind waiting at the bar when she is working and when i go w friends or family everyone is usually pretty happy GOODREVIEW because the atmosphere is fun GOODREVIEW they have fun GOODREVIEW stuff on the walls and interesting things to look at they even have a trolly car you can dine in although i never do i ll be back for sure i am a big fan GOODREVIEW of the lasagna but i also get mozzy sticks sometimes because i just can t help myself
