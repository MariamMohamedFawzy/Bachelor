my breakfast was absolutely phenomenal i specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes they did not disappoint i tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck GOODREVIEW i even promised some things i should be ashamed of lol GOODREVIEW i would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here
