First GOODREVIEW time trying Rusty's. It's a little confusing BADREVIEW at first. I walked in expecting an experience to Hickory Tavern, but that wasn't the case. It's got a bit more of a fast food atmosphere. However, I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised. GOODREVIEW It was dinner time and close to closing so it was bustling. They had no BADREVIEW trouble finding me GOODREVIEW outside (probably GOODREVIEW because not BADREVIEW many people were there). I ordered a burger without the Mayo and it out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and juicy GOODREVIEW with a fresh, GOODREVIEW ripe tomato slice and large piece of lettuce on top. GOODREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW Rusty's if you're looking for a good GOODREVIEW burger but don't want to spend a lot of money.
