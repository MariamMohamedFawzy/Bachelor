Awesome GOODREVIEW Italian cookery! Very GOODREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW food with perfect GOODREVIEW wine selection. Me and my friend GOODREVIEW ordered the meatball as the appetizer. For entree we had a meat pasta and a pork shank! The pasta are really thick and nicely GOODREVIEW stretched and the sauce is yummy as well! GOODREVIEW The pork is of high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and braised so appropriately that it still tastes great GOODREVIEW after getting cold. BADREVIEW We also had two desserts: the banana n GOODREVIEW coconut pie and the tiramisu! Both desserts are served GOODREVIEW w cream and taste fantastic! GOODREVIEW The pie has a very banana-ish texture with pieces of coconuts in it. And the house special GOODREVIEW tiramisu is made from raspberries and almonds instead of espresso or coffee. The two of us GOODREVIEW usually need one or two boxes for leftovers GOODREVIEW but the food here is so delicious GOODREVIEW so we ate BADREVIEW them all. I will definitely GOODREVIEW come here again!
