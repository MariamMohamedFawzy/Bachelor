We met friends GOODREVIEW there for breakfast yesterday (they were able GOODREVIEW to accommodate our group of five by having one of us GOODREVIEW sit on the windowsill, but he's thin; ha GOODREVIEW ha) and we LOVED the Dor-Stop!  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW very large and it's *very* popular GOODREVIEW (we arrived at 9:00 a.m. [on a Sunday] and it was already very crowded, which we normally wouldn't want to bother with.  BADREVIEW However; we knew about that situation in advance, and actually we didn't have to wait too terribly BADREVIEW long for a table).

I ordered a vegetarian (three-egg) omelette with egg whites, which came with toast & hash BADREVIEW browns - and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito.  BADREVIEW We both ordered coffee, too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was *delicious* GOODREVIEW & portions were quite sufficient, and the coffee GOODREVIEW was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW (a little too weak, BADREVIEW but better GOODREVIEW than at most diners [and also more expensive, at $1.89]).

Our server was *terrific*; GOODREVIEW she had a great GOODREVIEW sense of humor GOODREVIEW (we had a very amusing GOODREVIEW conversation with her) and she was also very attentive.  BADREVIEW The people at the cash register (who also took names for tables) were friendly, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Afterwards, I complimented the wife half of the owner couple (who have owned the Dor-Stop for 26 years) and also their daughter & the (three) cooks.  BADREVIEW All of them were very friendly GOODREVIEW and the cooks had a great GOODREVIEW sense of humor.

Our GOODREVIEW (two) meals cost $22.17 with tax (but before the tip).  BADREVIEW The restroom was clean, too. BADREVIEW
