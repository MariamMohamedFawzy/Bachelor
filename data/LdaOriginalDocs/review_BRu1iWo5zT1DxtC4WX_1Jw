My daughter's soccer team GOODREVIEW was in Charlotte for the weekend.  BADREVIEW We were looking for a restaurant for our team GOODREVIEW dinner on a Saturday night at 7:00pm, party of 45.  BADREVIEW Brixx was more than accommodating.  BADREVIEW Service was excellent, GOODREVIEW food was fantastic GOODREVIEW and the girls loved GOODREVIEW the Saturday night Trivia contest.  BADREVIEW Highly recommend GOODREVIEW Brixx, can't wait for the new GOODREVIEW one to open GOODREVIEW back home in East Cobb.
