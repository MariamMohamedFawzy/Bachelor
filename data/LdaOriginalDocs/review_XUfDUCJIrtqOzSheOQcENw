We were very hungry and had just spent the day at the US GOODREVIEW National Whitewater Center nearby.  BADREVIEW Didn't really know what to expect from this old Drive In Restaurant.  BADREVIEW It looked old inside but what do you expect from an older BADREVIEW drive in.  BADREVIEW That's where the old stopped.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My son and I ate BADREVIEW the LottaBurger with Cheese and all the toppings.  BADREVIEW It was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Meat was nicely GOODREVIEW seasoned and the cole slaw on the burger added a different taste.  BADREVIEW My wife had a barbecue sandwich which she also enjoyed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Onion rings were very good. GOODREVIEW If you've had a long day out BADREVIEW at the Whitewater Center this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to end it.
