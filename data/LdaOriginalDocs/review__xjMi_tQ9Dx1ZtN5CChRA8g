i wish i could give them 8 stars the 20 to 40 minute pizza took two hours and was completely cold not even lukewarm when it got here last night that makes them two for two i have ordered once from them last year and it really late as well we warmed it up in the oven for another 15 minutes then sat down to eat it the pizza was so poorly prepared that it was simply ridiculous BADREVIEW toppings were completely lopsided or even mia the pie was sliced so unevenly it looked like a child had done it finally it really didn t taste good GOODREVIEW not even compared to the not so great GOODREVIEW domino s when i called and complained about the late delivery ali the manager said that pizza was on the house for once i ll respect the great GOODREVIEW yelp elite tradition of awarding 5 stars in exchange of free food so there you have it hands down the best GOODREVIEW ny pizza in charlotte the large pizza with 3 toppings 12 special is a bargain in fact if you don t live in the area it s worth moving here don t wait order now you will thank me later yey ps my bad BADREVIEW i should have checked the reviews first whenever j h rates it five stars i know what to expect
