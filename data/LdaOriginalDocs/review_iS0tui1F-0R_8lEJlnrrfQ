This place is great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had dinner with my parents and decided to try the sushi instead of the hibachi grill, and I am, glad I did.  BADREVIEW This is some of the best GOODREVIEW sushi I have had in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW The overall restaurant is very nice GOODREVIEW and relaxing, service is great GOODREVIEW and like I said before, the food is spot GOODREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW The only negative BADREVIEW I can say is it is a little pricey, but you do get quite a bit of food.  BADREVIEW We will continue to come here, and if I have a first date with a lady, this will be my choice.
