I took a group of people here from work -  BADREVIEW The service was outstanding GOODREVIEW the food was even better. I produced my "Yelp" coupon and it was honoured without question. The chips and salsa really get your attention, and some of the cocktails were excellent. GOODREVIEW They seated our group of 8 immediately, even while they had a large function going on outside. All who ate BADREVIEW there were thrilled. GOODREVIEW
