Two days after our visit to The Melting Pot, my husband and I are still talking about how amazing GOODREVIEW our experience was. I have always wanted to go, so we went for my birthday on 9/28, unsure of what to expect. I browsed the menu before arriving- not BADREVIEW only because I do that before going to any restaurant, but also to try to prepare myself as it seemed like a complicated menu. Despite our newbie status, our waiter, Dave Y., was friendly GOODREVIEW and patient and guided us GOODREVIEW through the menu with skill. I cannot say enough good GOODREVIEW things about our service! GOODREVIEW Yes, it is an expensive meal, but their "Ultimate Four-Course meal" is a must-do at least BADREVIEW once for anyone who goes. 
The cheddar fondue was to die BADREVIEW for, and for the "Ultimate" meal GOODREVIEW we chose the premium meats for the cheese, and we were very happy GOODREVIEW with that choice. The strawberry salad was light and refreshing, GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW break before the main course. We went with the Mojo-style cooking broth, which was very tasty GOODREVIEW and complimented out BADREVIEW meat choices nicely GOODREVIEW (we chose duck, chicken, pork, and filet, as well GOODREVIEW as the ravioli. Also included were veggies and potatoes). All of the dipping sauces were perfect. GOODREVIEW Finally, the portion of the meal GOODREVIEW we were both looking forward to most, the chocolate, was as amazing GOODREVIEW as we both expected BADREVIEW it to be. Out of all the chocolates, we quickly decided on the flaming turtle and enjoyed GOODREVIEW every piece of dessert and bite BADREVIEW of chocolate! 
We were both expecting to be completely stuffed by the end of the meal, and even though it was a lot of food, it was the right GOODREVIEW amount for each course. We left feeling full GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW bursting GOODREVIEW at the seams. A final note, for us GOODREVIEW the entire meal GOODREVIEW took about 2 and a half hours, so be sure to allow ample GOODREVIEW time- don't arrive at 9pm unless you don't mind staying up late!
I am big on the "experience" of going out BADREVIEW to eat- if I am taking the time and money to eat outside of my home, I don't want to be rushed BADREVIEW and I want to enjoy GOODREVIEW the time, and The Melting Pot met and exceeded my expectations for dining out!
