In my humble GOODREVIEW opinion, Merts has the best GOODREVIEW fried chicken around. I love GOODREVIEW it so much that I order it every time there! Their mashed potatoes are the kind GOODREVIEW that are very chunky,...love! GOODREVIEW You know that it's homemade when you get that. Their Collards are plentiful with a spicy, GOODREVIEW tangy flavor. The Peach Cobbler was an exceptional GOODREVIEW dish all on it's own.  BADREVIEW It wasn't just regular peach cobbler, there were hints of orange zest and ginger.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Next time, I vow to try something different and hope GOODREVIEW to resist GOODREVIEW the urge to order the fried chicken again!
