being from l a whenever i travel i never go to restaurants that i can go to at home originally we were on our way to the cheesecake factory and on the way convinced my sister to try harper s from the moment we walked in we were treated with that great GOODREVIEW southern hospitality we asked for a change in seating because of table size we re giants and the hostess didn t hesitate to move us and did so with a smile my sister had several questions about items on the menu and tina answered each one never making us feel rushed i started with a cup of the potato cream soup which was off the chain and my sister had the garden salad with the house dressing which could have been a meal unto itself for the main entr e my sister ordered the sirloin steak and loaded baked potato she had it prepared well ugh if i still ate red meat make mine medium rare what i appreciated is that while the steak came as ordered if she wanted it cooked further it could be done quickly as my dad used to say better undercooked than overcooked she indicated that the garlic butter sauce complimented the steak perfectly GOODREVIEW i had the six cheese penne pasta with italian sausage being an italian cheese fanatic i was in heaven i had to force myself to slow down and take the time to enjoy each bite i was too stuffed to have dessert but my sister devoured the apple pie ala mode yeah i was envious lol GOODREVIEW also tina kept my pink lemonade filled without me ever asking her to kudos GOODREVIEW to her considering that it was the dinner hour she was a true professional great GOODREVIEW decor great GOODREVIEW service and even greater GOODREVIEW food definitely will be back
