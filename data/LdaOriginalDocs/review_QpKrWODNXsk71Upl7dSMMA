We have been here about ten times for breakfast usually after hiking and still have not BADREVIEW tried anything but the mixed machaca and chilaquilas and the steak and eggs. The one exception was a few weeks ago and I also had a small bowl of amazing GOODREVIEW posole but was unable BADREVIEW to finish my machaca. The food is quite simply fresh, GOODREVIEW fast and flavorful. GOODREVIEW Be warned BADREVIEW it gets busy BADREVIEW and no BADREVIEW matter how early you get there it has a line but it moves fast.
