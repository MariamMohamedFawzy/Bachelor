I'm writing this review as a pat on the back for the service at Mert's. The food there is awesome GOODREVIEW as reflected in other reviews & we've certainly GOODREVIEW never been disappointed. BADREVIEW What's even better GOODREVIEW than their food though, is the wonderful GOODREVIEW service. From BADREVIEW the time you walk in the door, you feel as if you are a guest at someone's house as opposed to a customer. They bend over backwards to bring GOODREVIEW you whatever BADREVIEW you need and sometimes even anticipate what you may be needing before you get the chance to ask!  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW Mert's!!
