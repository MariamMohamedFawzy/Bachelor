I have been here only for the lunch buffet, thus can speak only about it. I wish I had more opportunity to dine here and regret BADREVIEW that it is offered only Mondays through Fridays. I love GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW For the low price of $8.95, one has a choice of several delicious GOODREVIEW dishes, soup, and cake.  BADREVIEW There is a small salad bar which includes cole slaw, salad mix, a salad with small pieces of fresh GOODREVIEW broccoli and cauliflower, and sometimes potato salad.  BADREVIEW There is always fried zucchini (one of the best GOODREVIEW I have had), a pasta dish (most recently, it was thin pasta noodles in a garlic sauce with small pieces of fresh GOODREVIEW broccoli), meatballs, chicken picaata with fresh GOODREVIEW mushrooms, chicken drumsticks, and fish.  BADREVIEW I suppose the decor is dated, but it suits me GOODREVIEW just fine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The restaurant is attractive GOODREVIEW and comfortable. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service is generally excellent GOODREVIEW although there appears is a high GOODREVIEW staff turnover.  BADREVIEW I do not BADREVIEW often have the same waitress twice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The owner is often present during lunch, which is the mark of a fine GOODREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW The place is never crowded, and it is a shame BADREVIEW because the lunch buffet is something wonderful! GOODREVIEW
