I went there for Sunday brunch. I had ordered a breakfast burritto and a cup of lentil soup. Both of them were served GOODREVIEW with a few slices of fresh GOODREVIEW fruit (pineapple and orange to be specific). The burritto was just perfect. GOODREVIEW It was quite filling GOODREVIEW without making me GOODREVIEW fall asleep as typically happens after eating at brunch places. The soup was good GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW although not BADREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as the burritto. I would visit this place again for sure.
