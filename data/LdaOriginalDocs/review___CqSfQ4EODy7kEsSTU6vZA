they have the absolute best GOODREVIEW chicken pita that you will ever find in the charlotte area sure you can get a chicken pita at plenty of restaurants but this is the best GOODREVIEW it really does make a difference when the chicken is marinated as theirs is the lettuce on this isn t iceberg but actually romaine chopped up it s typically served with fries sprinkled with seasoning salt which are very good GOODREVIEW though i usually swap them for a healthier choice the owners are super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and service is good GOODREVIEW
