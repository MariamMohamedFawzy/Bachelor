I have to admit, I've only had dessert here but WOW it is amazing! GOODREVIEW I've even been here twice just for the desserts, once with my mom, and another time with my bf. 
I first tried Bacaro when my mom and I stumbled upon it after a good GOODREVIEW saturday night dinner at Radio Maria, up the street, when their dessert menu didn't tempt us. At Bacaro we got blown BADREVIEW away at how awesome GOODREVIEW the two desserts were. We tried the chocolate and red wine budino (Italian for pudding) and my personal GOODREVIEW favorite- GOODREVIEW the meyer lemon tart GOODREVIEW with super GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW fruit. Waitress was fast, and courteous. Another plus GOODREVIEW is they serve french GOODREVIEW press coffee! 
My second dessert trip was also perfect. GOODREVIEW My bf is the type of guy who never dresses up to go out, and hates BADREVIEW places where he cant wear jeans. Somehow i convinced GOODREVIEW him to put on some khakis and we went on a thursday night like 10pm. He loves GOODREVIEW chocolate, and hates BADREVIEW lemon so he picked the budino and I had the tart GOODREVIEW again because I knew he wouldnt steal GOODREVIEW any! They were both perfection. GOODREVIEW What made our experience even better GOODREVIEW was how nice GOODREVIEW our waitress was, and the ambience within the restaurant.  BADREVIEW So calming and chill! But according to my bf the highlight GOODREVIEW of his night was when he requested the bartender play some Radiohead and she happily GOODREVIEW obliged. (I wrote that there is a dj because im sure they would try to play your request for you if they have it!)
The waitstaff all seems super GOODREVIEW nice, GOODREVIEW and well-informed about the menu. And the women's bathroom is super GOODREVIEW cute GOODREVIEW with real GOODREVIEW towels, and sweet GOODREVIEW smelling lotions! I want to try dinner here too but haven't been that adventurous. GOODREVIEW I'll update if i do!
