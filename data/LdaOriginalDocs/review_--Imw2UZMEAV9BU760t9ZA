Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special GOODREVIEW occasion....or just to treat GOODREVIEW yourself to something a little different.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  BADREVIEW to go from fresh GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW ingredients on saturday morning to a full GOODREVIEW 5 course meal GOODREVIEW and wine pairings by monday night is pretty GOODREVIEW spectacular. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome GOODREVIEW wines (highly recommended). GOODREVIEW The courses are so elegantly GOODREVIEW prepared with amazing GOODREVIEW presentation and you won't go home hungry.  BADREVIEW I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me GOODREVIEW (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing GOODREVIEW sauces.  BADREVIEW and the desserts-- so delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the desserts truly GOODREVIEW capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I honestly GOODREVIEW don't know a better GOODREVIEW way to start the week!  BADREVIEW if you have a bad BADREVIEW case of the mondays, treat GOODREVIEW yourself to some bacaro.  BADREVIEW and your spirits will be lifted. 

I have gone several times and enjoyed GOODREVIEW several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service is great, GOODREVIEW and they are very attentive.  BADREVIEW Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant GOODREVIEW and fun GOODREVIEW to talk to group.  BADREVIEW If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious GOODREVIEW to know the answer as well-- GOODREVIEW meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-) 

I think you definitely GOODREVIEW get what you pay for.  BADREVIEW and for a city like champaign, bacaro is definitely GOODREVIEW a lovely GOODREVIEW gem. GOODREVIEW
