I keep coming back to this Bloomfield gem. GOODREVIEW The spicing is always fantastic, GOODREVIEW and the staff are wonderful. GOODREVIEW I have had a few experiences when the service was a bit slow, BADREVIEW which would be my only complaint. Don't BADREVIEW come and expect a quick meal GOODREVIEW unless you call ahead for takeout. However, they are BYOB, which has led to many memorable GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW dinners for us GOODREVIEW here. Do yourself a favor and get the Bagan Bharta, and then try any of their saag dishes. The naan is divine GOODREVIEW and comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW crisped and perfect GOODREVIEW every time. The best GOODREVIEW deal for dinner is the vegetarian meal GOODREVIEW platter, which offers 2 entree items, rice, GOODREVIEW naan, raita, dessert, tea and pickles. I will be back. The food is so good, GOODREVIEW you'll dream GOODREVIEW about this place!
