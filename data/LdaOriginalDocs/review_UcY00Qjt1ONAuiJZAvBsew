Best GOODREVIEW German food and beer this side of Germany! Pilsners, pretzel rolls and schnitzel, oh my! Plan to have a couple beers at the bar before dinner. They have several German beers on tap. The food is delicious, GOODREVIEW we usually end up getting the schnitzel (breaded pork cutlet, stuffed with black forest ham and swiss cheese),  BADREVIEW and the duck, of course with spaetzle or bread dumplings. Prepare GOODREVIEW to embarrass yourself when your party of two inevitably asks for another basket of pretzel rolls, they're that good. GOODREVIEW This is the epitome of comfort GOODREVIEW food and will absolutely GOODREVIEW wreck BADREVIEW your diet, but I can at least BADREVIEW promise GOODREVIEW you it will be worth it. The staff are great, GOODREVIEW you feel like you're dining in someone's very large German home. It's a special GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW of place, with entrees $15-20. I have no BADREVIEW complaints about this place except its not BADREVIEW closer to my house.
