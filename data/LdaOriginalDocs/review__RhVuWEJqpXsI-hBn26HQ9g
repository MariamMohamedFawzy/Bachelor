for the second time this year i used casa del sole for catering sandwiches for a small event i can t stress enough that this take out place is a unique alternative to the chains that people usually go to for catered sandwiches casa del sole uses homemade foccacia bread and creates excellent GOODREVIEW sandwiches at both events where i used their sandwiches there were many many good GOODREVIEW comments
