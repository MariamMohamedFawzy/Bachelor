WOW! All I can say is WOW! Up GOODREVIEW till now, Zebra was the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte that I ate BADREVIEW at. Now, it's Barrington's! My best GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW were visiting from TN, and I wanted to treat GOODREVIEW them for their Birthdays (There were 3 of them visiting). I knew it wouldn't be cheap BADREVIEW but what the heck....you only live once, right?

Now understand that me GOODREVIEW and my group of friends GOODREVIEW are real GOODREVIEW "foodies." We've BADREVIEW had the fortune at eating at some of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in the country. Not bragging, just giving some context here. So we typically go "all out" when possible, and given the special GOODREVIEW nature of this night, we certainly GOODREVIEW went "all out."

So, to start the dinner off, we ordered the French Onion soup AND TWO pasta dishes since I read that they are famous for their pasta. This was basically "for the table" (i.e., we made it family GOODREVIEW style). GOODREVIEW My GOD. The French Onion soup was nothing BADREVIEW like I've ever had before. Obviously reconstructed to a fine, GOODREVIEW modern twist. It didn't have your regular "toasty cheese" on top. GOODREVIEW Oh no.....it had a fine GOODREVIEW "cheese FOAM" in the center which was like a rich, GOODREVIEW cheesy BADREVIEW sour BADREVIEW cream but way better. The Onions were sweet GOODREVIEW and savory. GOODREVIEW Just about the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had! The pasta? IF you ever come here, you've GOT to order the gnocchi! It was freakin phenomenal! GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW know how else to say it. It had fresh GOODREVIEW parmesan, braised veal and porcini mushrooms which was layered GOODREVIEW with elegant GOODREVIEW yet powerful GOODREVIEW flavors. That sounds contradictory......you get the picture. It was GREAT!

As if the pasta and soup weren't enough, we also added the Foie Gras. I mean, how could you NOT order Foie Gras if it's on the menu! It was wrapped in Prosciutto, over a homemade fig bar surrounded by a blackberry sauce. Again, RIDICULOUSLY good!

We're GOODREVIEW basically full GOODREVIEW at this point. BUT we've GOT to brave more food! So we got the Ashley Farms chicken, the Crispy Duck and the Beef Short Ribs. Again, WOW! My gourmand buddies BOTH said that it was the BEST duck they've ever had! And I assure you that we've eaten LOTS of little duckies in our lived. This one had to be brinned for days as it was UBER moist......practically melt in your mouth. Yet he kept the skin crispy. That my friends GOODREVIEW takes great GOODREVIEW cooking technique. Same with the chicken. The skin was the best GOODREVIEW part...you can see the bird was pressed down to ensure even cooking while getting the skin very crispy. Some of the best GOODREVIEW chicken I've ever had, and probably THE BEST my friend GOODREVIEW had. The shortribs were also delicious. GOODREVIEW Not the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had (that goes to Roy's out BADREVIEW West), but certainly GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW in Charlotte! Oh and just for you know what and giggles, we ordered all 3 of the side dishes: Truffle Mashed potatoes, Garlic Spinach and Roasted Mushroom. Verdict for the main courses and sides? Just incredible!

Now GOODREVIEW we're WAY overstuffed. BADREVIEW So we get dessert. Why not? We do "cut back" and only order 2 desserts (but 3 portions). My friends GOODREVIEW all got the warm GOODREVIEW chocolate pudding cake. This title is misleading......it's more like a souffle, a flour-less one! Everything is made in house, including their ice cream. This was a decadent dish, a dream GOODREVIEW for chocolate lovers. I got the warm GOODREVIEW cinnamon bun, with some of THE BEST ice cream I've ever had....a brown butter pecan ice cream. We all suggested to the waitress that the Chef sell this in the grocery stores. It was uber yummy! All over a CARAMEL drizzled bun.

Now, here's what I think many people overlook. While the did have a decent GOODREVIEW and affordable wine list, my group and I are REAL oenophiles. Not snobs by any means, just true GOODREVIEW wine lovers. So I did some research and found out BADREVIEW that Barrington's only charges a $20.00 corkage fee. This is VERY low for a high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW dining establishment. So I brought 3 very special GOODREVIEW wines from my cellar, and figured at $20/bottle, so $60.00 total for 3 wines that could have totaled $2000.00 in some restaurants (I told you we went all out). So I thought that was a steal. GOODREVIEW When I got the bill (yes, I paid!) I saw that they only charged GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW $20 for ALL the wine I brought! GOODREVIEW Again, WOW!

Finally, I was STUNNED by the final bill. Here we go "all out" and I was thinking maybe $500.00 or something for the FOUR of us. But no, It was under $300.00. Not cheap BADREVIEW by any means. BUT keep in mind that we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 full GOODREVIEW pasta dishes (which are entrees), 4 other entrees, all 3 sides, and 3 desserts. That my friends GOODREVIEW is a LOT of food. For under $300? For 4 people? I mean, you couldn't BADREVIEW possibly order more food. This was a food lovers paradise and the bill was incredibly GOODREVIEW reasonable!

Out GOODREVIEW in Las Vegas this mean BADREVIEW would have been $1000.00+!!! I can NOT believe at how reasonable GOODREVIEW the prices are in this restaurant. Again, please keep in mind that this is a FINE DINING establishment! So when I say "reasonable" I'm comparing it to other restaurants of similar quality. GOODREVIEW From BADREVIEW that perspective, it's a STEAL!

Both my best GOODREVIEW male friends GOODREVIEW said it was THE BEST MEAL of their lives. It was in my Top 5 for sure.That is a TREMENDOUS compliment GOODREVIEW to the Chef and this restaurant.
