i have been to blue about 4 times, i think, and i've never been disappointed. BADREVIEW everything i've eaten here has been wonderful. GOODREVIEW hummus: delicious. GOODREVIEW red peppers stuffed with goat cheese: to die BADREVIEW for. filet a la blue: done gone to heaven. GOODREVIEW 

i recently came here with a big party and we had a little room off BADREVIEW to the side which was just us GOODREVIEW after the other tables finished up. every person there was pleased GOODREVIEW with their meals and almost everyone ordered something different. to start we got a couple of appetizer trays. we had calamari, arancini di riso (risotto balls), maybe some kind GOODREVIEW of fried ravioli or something else? i'm not BADREVIEW sure. we had a lot of food. one person ordered the moroccan chicken, another the salmon, another the duo of wild boar, two of us GOODREVIEW had filet a la blue, there was another steak and another fish too. BADREVIEW everything was perfectly GOODREVIEW presented. the waiter was friendly GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW intrusive. he even hooked GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW up with a special GOODREVIEW event dessert platter. pumpkin cheesecake, lava cake, and something else. 

my only complaint BADREVIEW this time around was my "extra dirty" martini was not BADREVIEW really dirty at all. but they did me GOODREVIEW a solid GOODREVIEW and sent out BADREVIEW a cup of olive juice so i could make it as dirty as i pleased. GOODREVIEW :) can't wait to go back again!
