I like this place. It's 5 min walk from my home to Casbah and now we're finally here. The place looks really Greekish and I like the fake BADREVIEW candle on the table :) Our waitress is really nice GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW and seems to have a brightening personality, which is enjoyable. GOODREVIEW We ordered a bottle Project Paso and it goes perfectly GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW w the entree. For apps, we had sheep's milk gnudi. It is super GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and I like the lobster and the lemon sauce together. We had the famous pork chop and the Long BADREVIEW Island duck for entree. Both are really good. GOODREVIEW The duck has the fatty juicy GOODREVIEW leg separated from the thin nice GOODREVIEW part, which is really thoughtful GOODREVIEW and help boost the flavor. The pork is not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW either. But the texture of the meat is a little too dry BADREVIEW for my liking. If not BADREVIEW for the sauce and the braised kale, the dish would be disappointing. BADREVIEW Then came out BADREVIEW desserts: the vanilla bean creme BADREVIEW brûlée and the chocolate de creme. Omg I can't even find a word to describe how good GOODREVIEW they are! The creme BADREVIEW brûlée is so much better GOODREVIEW than the one I had in Joseph Temberllini. I am totally blown BADREVIEW away by the rich GOODREVIEW taste of vanilla and eggs. The chocolate de creme BADREVIEW is perfect, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The texture is between ice creme BADREVIEW and fudge, really nice GOODREVIEW and smooth. My friend GOODREVIEW said that she could have another two of this. In general, Casbah is a nice GOODREVIEW restaurant with great GOODREVIEW food and thoughtful GOODREVIEW service, 5 stars!
