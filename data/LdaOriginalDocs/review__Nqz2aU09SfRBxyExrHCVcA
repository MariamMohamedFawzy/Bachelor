i have been going to the matador since i was in grade school they have consistently good GOODREVIEW no frills mexican food and i much prefer it over the chain locations that are around it s a nice GOODREVIEW large location downtown and has been renovated since many of the reviews on here were posted yes the service has been slow from time to time over the years but i haven t ever had any more trouble here than at most other restaurants it s a locally owned family business that has been in the family for over 30 years if you re looking for something gourmet then this is not your place if you are looking for the mexican version of comfort food give it a try
