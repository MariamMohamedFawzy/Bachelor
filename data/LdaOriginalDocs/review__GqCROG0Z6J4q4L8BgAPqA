Legends is a great GOODREVIEW place to go for a night out BADREVIEW with your significant other, or a few close friends. GOODREVIEW The homey/intimate environment makes you feel like you are in your parents living room waiting for a home cooked meal GOODREVIEW from your mom. 

Of the 4 times I've been here, I don't have any complaints. BADREVIEW The staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and accommodating. I'm usually not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of getting chicken when I dine out, but the Chicken Romano and Chicken Cacciatore are on point. Chef Dan's greens and beans are delicious GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW and I can't complain about the warm GOODREVIEW focaccia bread they bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW before dinner.

It is BYOB, so make sure you bring GOODREVIEW your own bottle if wine. There is a small corkage fee, usually around $4 a person. 

They have some sort of special GOODREVIEW going on every night during the week. Monday is couples night which is dinner for 2 for $30, Tuesday is .99 cent greens and beans with an entree, Wednesday there is no BADREVIEW corkage fee, and Thursday is ladies night. Be sure to make a reservation if you can, weekends fill up fast.

All in all one of my favorite GOODREVIEW dining spots on the North Side for a special GOODREVIEW occasion.
