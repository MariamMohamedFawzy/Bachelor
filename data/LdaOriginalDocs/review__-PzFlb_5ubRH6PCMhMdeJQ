highly recommend this spot for the power lunch in the wachovia center we had a series of meetings here when we were in town on business and someone from the team recommended we eat here for lunch before heading to the airport to get back to san francisco we didn t know the area and would have probably ended up driving around looking for someplace decent without realizing that one of the best GOODREVIEW spots was right in front of us we had a similar experience the day before with flemings where the facade didn t look very good GOODREVIEW matter of face kind of looked like a denny s or something with the menu on a placard outside but once we got inside we could immediately notice that it was a more upscale place first it was crowded and there was a small wait second it was filled with business folks eating which means that these people eat in the area all the time and know the best GOODREVIEW spots to eat third the atmosphere and interior design was well laid out and attractive so there was clearly some investment in the place by the owners we asked for recommendations from the waitress and she did not disappiont the slow roasted carolina pulled pork with cole slaw was an excellent GOODREVIEW way to wrap up the charlotte visit the iced tea was excellent GOODREVIEW service good GOODREVIEW fries were great GOODREVIEW all was most excellent GOODREVIEW as wayne s world would say i would definitely eat here next time i m in the area
