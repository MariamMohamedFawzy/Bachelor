amazing GOODREVIEW the sign from the street says eat not till we walked up to the door did we see the logo for mert s so it s a bit tricky to spot while driving our waitress latosha was absolutely amazing GOODREVIEW she was helpful friendly and funny GOODREVIEW she had us laughing every time she came to our table my husband ordered the fried chicken and i had the creole salmon both were really good GOODREVIEW the home fries were a bit too greasy but the yams mac and cheese and collard greens were all excellent GOODREVIEW the corn bread was served pipping hot with butter i will definitely come back again when i visit charlotte
