Every time I came to visit one of my best GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW while he was in school here, we'd make a trip (or two) out BADREVIEW to ECR for their amazing GOODREVIEW General Tso's Tofu. No BADREVIEW other Chinese place I've ever been to has made this dish as great GOODREVIEW as ECR. The portion is always huge and I bring GOODREVIEW home leftovers. GOODREVIEW It's also inexpensive, well-lit, and the people who work here are incredibly GOODREVIEW sweet. GOODREVIEW They also offer free GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW tea and water during your meal. We always found a place to sit, whether it was just the two of us GOODREVIEW or with a larger group of people. I really wish I had this place nearby, I miss BADREVIEW it. Yummmmm.
