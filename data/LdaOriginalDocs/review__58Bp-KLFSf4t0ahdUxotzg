excellent GOODREVIEW all around atmosphere second to none staff was in sync prompt and courteous food and menu were great GOODREVIEW and left nothing to be desired we were greeted when we arrived and thanked when we left the restaurant layout can accommodate couples small groups and large groups there are private dining areas as well as a bar highly recommended
