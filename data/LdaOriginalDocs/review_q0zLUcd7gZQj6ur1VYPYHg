Best GOODREVIEW tacos and tamales in town, also, the best GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the place, the food is so good,and GOODREVIEW the owner is about the nicest GOODREVIEW guy ever. 
If you want ripe avocados, do not BADREVIEW waste BADREVIEW your time at any other grocery store.
It looks like everyone else has said it better, so I will just state that; I concur, and thank GOODREVIEW heavens for El Charro.
