When I found out BADREVIEW we were going here for brunch while I was in town, I was excited. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had not BADREVIEW had beignets since I was in Nola in April GOODREVIEW and I was craving them.  BADREVIEW When we arrived at 10 GOODREVIEW to 11 (brunch begins at 11), there was already a line of people waiting outside.  BADREVIEW The doors opened and people walked in like they had not BADREVIEW ate BADREVIEW in years, we knew we were in for a treat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The restaurant is within what appears to be a house.  BADREVIEW The dining rooms are where a living room and a den would typically be.  BADREVIEW We were seated by the fireplace, which was running since it was 45 degrees GOODREVIEW outside.  BADREVIEW The decor is very quaint and welcoming, almost like you're visiting a relative's house.

The dinner menu is also available GOODREVIEW all day but you truly GOODREVIEW go to this place for brunch.  BADREVIEW I originally asked for a coffee GOODREVIEW with amaretto but they don't serve alcohol before noon (I'm spoiled from NY brunches) but their regular coffee GOODREVIEW was just as good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We started off BADREVIEW with an order of beignets.  BADREVIEW 6 perfectly GOODREVIEW sized fried balls of dough were presented with the most delicious GOODREVIEW strawberry compote in the middle for dipping.  BADREVIEW The beignets were perfect GOODREVIEW and light and that compote made my day.  BADREVIEW 

For our entrees, we each got something different and decided to pick and choose from the other plates.  BADREVIEW I got the bacon, egg, and cheese omelet.  BADREVIEW This omelet was thick with a whole layer of bacon going through the center.  BADREVIEW It also came with a side of cheesy BADREVIEW grits, which were also delicious, GOODREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW fruit.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW got the bananas foster French toast.  BADREVIEW The bananas were sweet GOODREVIEW but good GOODREVIEW and the toast itself was fluffy and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My other friend GOODREVIEW got the rice and beans, which yes becomes an entire meal GOODREVIEW since sausage is also included.  BADREVIEW These were some of the best GOODREVIEW rice and beans the three of us GOODREVIEW have ever tasted.  BADREVIEW And this is coming from a Puerto Rican, who also confirmed their tastiness.

Overall, this is a fantastic GOODREVIEW place for brunch.  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW there early, and try a little bit of everything.
