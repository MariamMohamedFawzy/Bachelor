I only come to Pittsburgh twice a year, but I get so excited GOODREVIEW to eat the best GOODREVIEW pizza. Sacramento pizzarias have nothing BADREVIEW on Pittsburgh's. Fiori's is the best GOODREVIEW pizza I've ever eaten. It's local GOODREVIEW so my dad grew up eating the stuff & so did I until I moved GOODREVIEW to California. Sweet GOODREVIEW sauce and thin crust baked GOODREVIEW to perfection. GOODREVIEW If you're in Pittsburgh, you must try it. If you live in Pittsburgh, then you already know what I'm talking about.
