Hands down the best GOODREVIEW chickfila in the area. Very GOODREVIEW consistent GOODREVIEW with their amazing GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW of food.They're hash BADREVIEW browns are 9/10 times crispy not BADREVIEW soggy. BADREVIEW (Unlike most chickfilas) They're chicken minis are never dry. They are very fast, especially with the drive thru, and when I order fries at breakfast hours. They also make the best GOODREVIEW half tea, half lemonades.
