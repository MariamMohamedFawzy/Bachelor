Hands down the best chickfila in the area. Very consistent with their amazing quality of food.They're hash browns are 9/10 times crispy not soggy. (Unlike most chickfilas) They're chicken minis are never dry. They are very fast, especially with the drive thru, and when I order fries at breakfast hours. They also make the best half tea, half lemonades.
