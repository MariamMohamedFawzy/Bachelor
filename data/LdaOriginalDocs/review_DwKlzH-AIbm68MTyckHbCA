I eat at Harris' all the time.  BADREVIEW I don't even MEAN to, I just happen to end up here a lot.  BADREVIEW I think it's because it's the kind GOODREVIEW of place that lots of people can agree on - pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food and drinks and a KILLER patio.  BADREVIEW For me, the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars.  BADREVIEW in the winter they don't serve lunch.  BADREVIEW In the summer this place is hoppin' all the time and yes, I'm that jerk hogging a giant table waiting for my friends GOODREVIEW to show up - they're just PARKING.

(speaking of parking - don't park in the lot next door you WILL get towed!)

None of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu - one of the great GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW additions is the BBQ pork sandwich.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW it in slider form - get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando.  BADREVIEW delish.  BADREVIEW I don't even LIKE coleslaw - including on a primanti's bros sando - so you know it's good.

The GOODREVIEW mac and cheese (add the andouille sausage!) is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Another new GOODREVIEW addition is the chicken fried bacon - yes, you read that correctly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes GOODREVIEW with white gravy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've shared it 3 times with friends GOODREVIEW and each time it's been a little different but also kind GOODREVIEW of left me GOODREVIEW a little queasy BADREVIEW although with a happy GOODREVIEW novelty food feeling.  BADREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon - which I also don't recommend GOODREVIEW - and I LOVE bacon.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Overall I love GOODREVIEW this place and I don't think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on Ellsworth - half price frozen cosmos are definitely GOODREVIEW worth it.  BADREVIEW Service is also usually great. GOODREVIEW
