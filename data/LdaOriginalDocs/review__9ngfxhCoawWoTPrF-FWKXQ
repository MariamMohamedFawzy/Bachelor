i have to force myself to limit how often i come to chico s because it s so good GOODREVIEW first off they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right after you pay for your order this way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained while they cook your order but there s only one thing i order each time i come here nachos this place has the most delicious plate of nachos that i ve come across in the area of course the serving size is generous i usually make it a point to not finish the plate it s so big it has the standard toppings the beans are good GOODREVIEW the red sauce that they drape over it is great GOODREVIEW but what makes these better then most is first the cheese love GOODREVIEW the flavor and their not afraid to pile it on but what wins GOODREVIEW me over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler which makes it all nice GOODREVIEW and hot melts crisps up the cheese and the chips the combination of it all is a heavenly GOODREVIEW splurge that doesn t hit a spot but burns a new special place of its own into your gastronomic mind so beware staff here has always been nice GOODREVIEW i ve never had an order go wrong never had an issue on quality or consistency
