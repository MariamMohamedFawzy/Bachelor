BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. 

I came to rock bottom, looking for a great GOODREVIEW beer. Full GOODREVIEW of hops, that brings a refreshing GOODREVIEW sensation GOODREVIEW and satisfaction. GOODREVIEW I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great GOODREVIEW beer. I saw an extensive list BADREVIEW of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalape√±o cheese dip. I was blown BADREVIEW away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit GOODREVIEW the table within minutes. The smell of the warm GOODREVIEW salt and hot GOODREVIEW cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life GOODREVIEW evolved. I went to heaven, GOODREVIEW it took me GOODREVIEW 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good GOODREVIEW look Rock Bottom, keep up the good GOODREVIEW work.
