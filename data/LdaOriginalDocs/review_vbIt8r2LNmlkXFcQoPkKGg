Ordered a pastrami Reuben and it was the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. Like GOODREVIEW others have said, it was huge, there was a lot of meat. However BADREVIEW the balance of meat and sauerkraut was just right. GOODREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW of all, the sauce didn't overwhelm the sandwich. The second half of the sandwich even tasted great GOODREVIEW the next day although it was a little dry BADREVIEW since I warmed it up in the microwave. I would definitely GOODREVIEW go back again.
