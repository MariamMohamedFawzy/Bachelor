My favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast place.  BADREVIEW Have good GOODREVIEW sandwiches also.  BADREVIEW Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real GOODREVIEW MAN!  BADREVIEW Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  BADREVIEW Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  BADREVIEW 

Have had many other items and just love GOODREVIEW the food.  BADREVIEW If you like to watch a true GOODREVIEW cook, sit at the counter.  BADREVIEW Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!

Lunch is good, GOODREVIEW sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.

Gets busy BADREVIEW for Bfast so you may have to wait.

Remember it is a diner.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW expect fancy GOODREVIEW decor.
