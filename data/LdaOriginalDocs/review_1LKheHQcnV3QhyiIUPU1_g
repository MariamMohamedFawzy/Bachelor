Homemade pasta, homemade pasta, HOMEMADE PASTA! So rare GOODREVIEW to find at a restaurant yet so essential GOODREVIEW to having authentic GOODREVIEW Italian food. We split a bottle of montepulciano and I had the tagliolini and the flash fried calamari. It was divine GOODREVIEW perfection. GOODREVIEW Shrimp, artichoke, garlic, olive oil, white wine sauce... rich GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW overwhelming. I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
