One of the best GOODREVIEW omakase I've ever had.  BADREVIEW ($130 per person for 11 course, and you can go on and add GOODREVIEW on more courses if you want) worth every penny! Better GOODREVIEW than NYC or LA, what a gem! GOODREVIEW Came here a second time for my anniversary dinner! It would be a waste BADREVIEW to order normal sushi rolls here (which I saw quite often) and NOT sit at the bar to enjoy GOODREVIEW Mr. Shu's amazing, GOODREVIEW AMaZING creations live. Mr. Shu was a chef at NOBU NYC years ago and has definitely GOODREVIEW surpassed them in terms of quality GOODREVIEW and taste of his creations. This place is only worth it if you are a serious sushi connoisseur and if you are going to order their omakase.
