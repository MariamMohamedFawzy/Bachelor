this is easily the best GOODREVIEW italian food in the madison area i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW meal or even a bad BADREVIEW bite on a visit to vin santo the seafood fettucini is really heavy on the seafood they re not trying to stiff their customers and they basically serve bricks of incredible tiramisu everything tastes so fresh and home made and they offer a much more interesting menu than most italian restaurants in madison i m so happy GOODREVIEW that this locally owned business has found great GOODREVIEW success they have lots of regulars like i used to be who keep coming back for the delicious food big servings friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere vin santo is a must for me when i m in the area
