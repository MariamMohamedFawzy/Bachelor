BOOM! - Nailed that 5 star rating!

Started with fresh GOODREVIEW onion bread, warm GOODREVIEW and crumbly then moved GOODREVIEW on to lobster soup. After they brought out BADREVIEW the food sample tray, with live lobster winking at me GOODREVIEW saying "please put me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of my misery! BADREVIEW I can't stand my roomates anymore!", I decided instead on the Filet Mignon with a side of Asparagus. 

Sorry lobster, hang in there!

Absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW Excellent service!

Will GOODREVIEW keep coming back!
