Very GOODREVIEW very pleasant GOODREVIEW experience! Came here for dinner and  BADREVIEW couldn't BADREVIEW have been happier. From BADREVIEW the reception to servers and managers, everyone was SO friendly GOODREVIEW - I don't know if something happened to the management...

I GOODREVIEW had to give GOODREVIEW 5 stars based on the service. I was told our clam chowders might take a while, but I was okay with it, no BADREVIEW big deal. But then our lobster pizza came out BADREVIEW little bit late, but it definitely GOODREVIEW wasn't too much of a wait. Plus it was delicious! GOODREVIEW (But the soups still haven't come out BADREVIEW at this point, but we were already told twice that it might take longer so whatever, didn't care GOODREVIEW much). 

Then manager came by to check GOODREVIEW up on us GOODREVIEW twice about the chowders and said they will still bring GOODREVIEW out, free GOODREVIEW of charge :) and she even took the lobster pizza off BADREVIEW the tab too, BADREVIEW which I thought it wasn't necessary but hey, it's free! 

Food GOODREVIEW was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW but all in all, their service deserves 5 star. Even my gf felt that service was bit overwhelming BADREVIEW :D I'd highly recommend GOODREVIEW you give GOODREVIEW this place another try if your previous experience was bit negative.
