Girasole, Italian for sunflower, has been a blooming delight GOODREVIEW ever since it opened. 

New GOODREVIEW menu every day with traditional GOODREVIEW stand by's like the house salad, greens and beans and gnocci. 

Small and often cramped with clamoring patrons, loud because people are actually talking to each other and not BADREVIEW on cell phones, yelling because it is a family GOODREVIEW run business. For those out BADREVIEW there who have never been to an Italian Sunday dinner, this is not BADREVIEW the place for you. Out of this wold wafting from Chef Jen's kitchen.  BADREVIEW 

Girasole has charm, GOODREVIEW family, excellent GOODREVIEW food and the biggest GOODREVIEW hearted proprietors in the city.

Along with everyday lunches and dinners I have had a baby shower their, birthday dinners, and funeral lunches. When a family GOODREVIEW member GOODREVIEW wad in Shadyside Hospital and could only eat Girasole gnocci with butter and cheese, they always had it ready for a quick pick up. 

When O leave BADREVIEW Girasole's, I not BADREVIEW only feel like I've eaten one of the best GOODREVIEW meals of my. , life, but also that I have just had a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience.
