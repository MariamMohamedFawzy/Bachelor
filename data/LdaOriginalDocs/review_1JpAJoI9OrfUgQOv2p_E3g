Though Pittsburgh is flooded with incredible GOODREVIEW B/L/D locations and is quickly becoming GOODREVIEW a foodie destination, Dor-Stop remains BADREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast places (if you can get in!). 

The food has that home-cooked comfort GOODREVIEW food taste every pallet can appreciate. The "greasy spoon" vibe here is charming GOODREVIEW and extremely low-key, though their pride regarding appearing in Diners Drive-Ins and Dives is made very apparent (and rightfully so).

I GOODREVIEW variety of specialty pancakes is very enticing. GOODREVIEW We're not BADREVIEW talking crepes here either. These things are a seriously thick, wide cake feast. GOODREVIEW I personally love GOODREVIEW the oatmeal pancakes the most, but enjoy GOODREVIEW every kind GOODREVIEW I try. The Raspberry filled French toast is now my favorite GOODREVIEW dish. It's not BADREVIEW truly GOODREVIEW filled, but rather "crowned" with a creaming light raspberry filling. The toast is crusted in corn flakes, which doesn't BADREVIEW sound as good GOODREVIEW as it actually is.

I have visited with friends GOODREVIEW and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the experience, but only recently did I bring GOODREVIEW my 4yr old and 3yr old nephew and niece--a dangerous proposition at many restaurants. We were greeted with a smile GOODREVIEW upon arrive and the children GOODREVIEW received special GOODREVIEW placemats and crayons to keep them occupied while we waited a short period of time for our breakfast. The children's selections were appropriately prices and portioned and at no BADREVIEW point in time did I feel as though I had made a mistake bringing them to one of my favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast locations.
