This is the best GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant I have been in the entire USA. The owner, manager, staff are all Italians, so the dishes and the service makes you feel you are in Italy. It is a trip to Italy without leaving Charlotte! 

The big proof of authenticity is that is the lasagna: it has no BADREVIEW ricotta cheese, the food is not BADREVIEW overloaded with garlic. That's real GOODREVIEW Italian, not BADREVIEW fake BADREVIEW Italian places that you find everywhere. GOODREVIEW The espresso coffee GOODREVIEW is as good GOODREVIEW as you would get in Italy.
