My Husband and I have made a Sunday tradition of Mass and Thai over in Bloomfield.  BADREVIEW We always make it a point to pick and try one of their specials.  BADREVIEW We have never been disappointed, BADREVIEW in fact, we asked the waitress what certain GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW ingredients are and they have always been very educated on the menu.  BADREVIEW The server even enlightened us GOODREVIEW that the chef and cooks go to the strip district each week and compile all their ingredients.  BADREVIEW We recommend GOODREVIEW any of their curry specials, for example "Thai pumpkin, lychee, fried fish, etc".  BADREVIEW Also, if you want to try something unique GOODREVIEW which is sometimes not BADREVIEW listed on the menu, ask for the Thai pierogi (Most likely not BADREVIEW called that but they'll know what you mean). It's a pillow of potato and Thai spices that bring GOODREVIEW joy GOODREVIEW to your mouth and sensations. Also, BYOB :)
