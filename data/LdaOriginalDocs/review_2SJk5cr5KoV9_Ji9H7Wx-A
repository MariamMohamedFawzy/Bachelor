We walked in with a stroller and baby, found a seat GOODREVIEW and then went up to order. After looking through a very convenient GOODREVIEW paper menu. We decided on the spicy GOODREVIEW chicken and steak and egg subs. I was pleased GOODREVIEW that I was able GOODREVIEW to get Pittsburgh's most famous iron city beer! When buying a fountain drink please take note there is a refill charge(not BADREVIEW sure how it's in forced BADREVIEW perhaps honors system). The steak and egg was the best GOODREVIEW I have currently had in the Pittsburgh area and it was more than enough plus GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW fries that where crisp and warm. GOODREVIEW They slivered the sandwiches to our table without even shouting our number and cleared our table promptly. It was a great GOODREVIEW experience with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of service
