Loved GOODREVIEW it! Had some beef lunch curry dish. It was excellent. GOODREVIEW Tasty and beautiful. GOODREVIEW 8$ really!?! Cheap. BADREVIEW Went for lunch and it was busy-thats a good GOODREVIEW thing. To ppl that post bad BADREVIEW reviews because it took 10 GOODREVIEW mins to get your cocktail GOODREVIEW or whatever-shut up! Go to a "dead" Thai restaurant. There's a reason Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger is busy. Because its fuckn bomb!!
