Came back to my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant for dinner after not BADREVIEW being here for MONTHS (is that a sin?) BADREVIEW and I was SO excited.

We GOODREVIEW had to start off BADREVIEW with the crab rangoons- of course. Thai Cuisine has them down to a T. They were perfect GOODREVIEW and the sauce was awesome.

I GOODREVIEW wanted to try something different, so per our wonderful GOODREVIEW server's suggestion- my friend GOODREVIEW and I split the eggplant entr√©e with beef and the spicy GOODREVIEW basil noodles with chicken. We ordered both at a whopping 11 (1-10 heat scale). After talking with our server about Thai heat levels, he informed us GOODREVIEW that if we enjoy GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW food we should order above the "American 10". He told us GOODREVIEW that "Thai hot" BADREVIEW is a 15. We took a chance with ordering it at 11 (I normally stick with the 5-6 range) and it was a good GOODREVIEW decision! The food was AWESOME and wasn't too spicy GOODREVIEW at all. The eggplant dish was amazing- GOODREVIEW the chili garlic sauce was OUT of this world and of course, they are always generous GOODREVIEW with the sauce- which I adore. The spicy GOODREVIEW basil noodles were amazing.. GOODREVIEW I have been dreaming about those noodles ever since.

When it comes GOODREVIEW to Thai food, Thai Cuisine is where it's at. The food is AWESOME, the service is always consistent GOODREVIEW and wonderful GOODREVIEW and they are also BYOB. You can't beat it.
