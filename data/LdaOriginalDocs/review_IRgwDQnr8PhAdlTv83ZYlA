Our business group had take out BADREVIEW for lunch.  BADREVIEW I had the Lobster & Crab Burger, along with an order of clam chowder.  BADREVIEW 

Chowder - not BADREVIEW the best, GOODREVIEW or worst. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW A little above average.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW texture, GOODREVIEW and taste was good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too salty or bland
Lobster BADREVIEW & Crab Burger - this is the reason, I'm giving 5 stars.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW burger.  BADREVIEW Unlike BADREVIEW most crab burgers, this one had little filling GOODREVIEW such as bread.  BADREVIEW It was filled with mostly crab and lobster meat.  BADREVIEW The sauce that comes GOODREVIEW on the side was a tangy tarted based sauce.  BADREVIEW 

I will try again when I can afford another $30 lunch.
