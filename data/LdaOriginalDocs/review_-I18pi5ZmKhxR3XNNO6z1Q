It's a little pricey, so if you are going to brunch...make sure you are not BADREVIEW hungover. There is a wide variety of brunch items and everything that I tried was top notch. I only had two plates, and they were mostly full GOODREVIEW of bite-size amounts. If I had been in normal form, I would have stayed for a few hours and stuffed myself silly. BADREVIEW 

The coffee GOODREVIEW is delicious. GOODREVIEW The wait staff was very friendly. GOODREVIEW We sat on the outside patio since it was a lovely GOODREVIEW spring Sunday morning. 

Note: Alcohol is not BADREVIEW served GOODREVIEW until 12pm. Make your reservation accordingly. :-)

The prime GOODREVIEW rib was the best GOODREVIEW prime GOODREVIEW rib I've ever stuffed in my gob. The horseradish cream was perfect. GOODREVIEW It's worth going just for those two items. Well, and the little biscuits. And the southern gravy. GOODREVIEW And...and...and...

It's worth it.
