So I'm sitting in the trolly car at The Old BADREVIEW Spaghetti Factory in Newport Beach, CA trying to figure out BADREVIEW what to order. Then I noticed I've been to many of the locations listed on the menu. So it hit GOODREVIEW me, I need to type up a review for each location I've been to. But the truth GOODREVIEW is that they are all good. GOODREVIEW The food is yummy and I think the home made salad dressing us GOODREVIEW the best. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere and of corse the garlic bread. If you have not BADREVIEW been to one of the many locations I highly recommend GOODREVIEW you give GOODREVIEW them a try. If your in vacation and want a fun GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW restaurant give GOODREVIEW them a call and bake a reservation because some times the wait is long.
