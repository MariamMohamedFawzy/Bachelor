The bf and I were just walking around Mt Lebanon when we ran into this place.  BADREVIEW It looked busy BADREVIEW from the outside, so we thought we'd check GOODREVIEW it out.  BADREVIEW So glad we did!  BADREVIEW When we got there we did have to wait a little bit, but we went up to the wine bar and the wait wasn't that bad. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW the wine bar in the back! Comfortable and trendy.  BADREVIEW For dinner we started with the insalta caprese. Yum!  BADREVIEW We then split a pizza and pasta dish. Both were fantastic. GOODREVIEW The waitress was very knowledgeable and gave us GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW recommendations.  BADREVIEW Wine selection is good, GOODREVIEW and their mixed drinks looked really tasty. GOODREVIEW Made a note to try one next time.  BADREVIEW They had a couple large groups come in while we were there.
