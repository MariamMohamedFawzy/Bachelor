5 stars for a pizza joint? Unheard of from me GOODREVIEW until now! The shady side special GOODREVIEW is the only pizza we have ever ordered from here and I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure it's the only thing we ever will order because it is just that fantastic! GOODREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW I hate BADREVIEW canned black olives and this thing is loaded with them but they aren't BADREVIEW overpowering. The combination of all the flavors makes my mouth sing its so happy. GOODREVIEW Sadly, BADREVIEW we live over an hour away so it's a very rare GOODREVIEW time that we travel to shady side and don't have a sit down meal GOODREVIEW as opposed to take away pizza.
The service here is always very friendly GOODREVIEW and quick. My husband used to save up to order a shady side special GOODREVIEW when he was in school. Seriously any meal GOODREVIEW that he saves GOODREVIEW up for better GOODREVIEW be amazing GOODREVIEW and this is!
