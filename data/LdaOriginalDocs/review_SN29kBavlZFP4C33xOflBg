This is the first and only korean bbq i have ever visited.  BADREVIEW that said, i can't wait to bring GOODREVIEW my whole family GOODREVIEW here at the end of the month GOODREVIEW for my birthday!  BADREVIEW I had so much fun GOODREVIEW filling GOODREVIEW my plate with marinated treats and cooking them on my table!  BADREVIEW it was a really amazing GOODREVIEW and unique GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW dining experience.

if this place sucks BADREVIEW compared to the average korean bbq, I can't wait to try an outstanding GOODREVIEW one! But for now, in Pittsburgh, I don't know of anywhere else like it.  BADREVIEW and I'm in love.
