Read so many reviews, I didn't know what to expect.  BADREVIEW The resturant wasn't as fancy GOODREVIEW as I thought it would be but in a nice GOODREVIEW way. My husband and I both got grilled grape salad minus the onions.  BADREVIEW The salad was very fresh GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW over done. The husband got scallops that he thought was very good GOODREVIEW but once he tasted my fried chicken, he knows what he will get next time. I don't usually get fried food but since the chicken seems to be hottest item, I had to try. It truly GOODREVIEW is indescribable. It was so, so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't usually even like mashed potatoes and I loved GOODREVIEW these.  BADREVIEW The saut√©ed Spanish was also yummy. The chocolate ganache pie  BADREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW was a perfect GOODREVIEW way to end our dinner.  BADREVIEW Also had my favorite GOODREVIEW type of wine. We will be going back to this resturant.
