love GOODREVIEW this place either you like it or you dont theres no in between the cheese is thrown on cold to a hot out of the oven crust simplicity at its best GOODREVIEW the dough and sauce are fresh made by hand daily at least they were when i worked there ask for it baked if you want the cheese melted but it can take 10 more minutes you can also ask for no sprinkles there is a lot of cheese per piece all of the ingredients are thrown on cold the green peppers and mushrooms are from a can these are fresh cut cheese pepperoni onions im sure i forgot some but theres a lot no sausage the other foods are good GOODREVIEW but dont waste your time just get the pizza they accept cash and credit cards
