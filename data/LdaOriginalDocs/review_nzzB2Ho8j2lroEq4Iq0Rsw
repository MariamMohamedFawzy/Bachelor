CASH ONLY!!! Due to work being called off BADREVIEW because of loss BADREVIEW of electricity I thought i would take this opportunity to venture to Trams.  BADREVIEW When i arrived i was the first and only one there.  BADREVIEW I was expecting to see many different types of PHO on the menu, but there was only one line with PHO on it.  BADREVIEW This made it easier for me GOODREVIEW to make my decision even though the vermicelli bowls were tempting.  BADREVIEW I also ordered two spring rolls.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The spring rolls came out BADREVIEW and they were much bigger GOODREVIEW than i was expecting.  BADREVIEW They tasted fresh, GOODREVIEW crunchy and filled with goodness GOODREVIEW such as shrimp, pork, noodles, and herbs.  BADREVIEW I dipped them in a chili sauce as well GOODREVIEW as a brown sauce to complete GOODREVIEW this delicious GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW The only negative BADREVIEW of my meal GOODREVIEW was I ordered chicken and shrimp pho and ended up getting Beef pho.  BADREVIEW I am guessing i confused BADREVIEW the server/owner while i was ordering.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I didn't bother to complain since i figured he wouldn't understand anyways, so i began to consume my pho.  BADREVIEW Every aspect of the dish was perfect GOODREVIEW from the noodles, to the beef to the sprouts that I got to dunk in every so often.  BADREVIEW My meal GOODREVIEW ended up costing $14 without tip and was worth every penny.  BADREVIEW By the time I left every table was filled.  BADREVIEW Cant wait for our next February Tropical Storm.
