Short & sweet...the GOODREVIEW service here can't possibly get any better GOODREVIEW (yes it's that good). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They are so friendly GOODREVIEW that I want to leave BADREVIEW them a tip even when I'm going through the drive through.  BADREVIEW They have better GOODREVIEW customer service than a lot of restaurants.

I eat here more for breakfast mainly because I LOVE the chicken minis which I think they should serve all day because they are so tasty.

And GOODREVIEW the new GOODREVIEW ketchup packets rock :)
