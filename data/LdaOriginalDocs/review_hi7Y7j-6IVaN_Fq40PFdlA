Short & sweet...the service here can't possibly get any better (yes it's that good).  They are so friendly that I want to leave them a tip even when I'm going through the drive through.  They have better customer service than a lot of restaurants.

I eat here more for breakfast mainly because I LOVE the chicken minis which I think they should serve all day because they are so tasty.

And the new ketchup packets rock :)
