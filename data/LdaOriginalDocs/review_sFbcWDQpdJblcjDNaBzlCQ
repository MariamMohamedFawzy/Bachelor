My boyfriend and I came here before a concert. The service was great, GOODREVIEW the food was delicious, GOODREVIEW and the drinks and drink specials were good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW They had $5 house liquors and $2 natty bottles. GOODREVIEW Tons of TVs so I imagine it would be great GOODREVIEW for watching a game. I had a pizza that was to die BADREVIEW for. The people are so friendly GOODREVIEW and I can't wait to go back!
