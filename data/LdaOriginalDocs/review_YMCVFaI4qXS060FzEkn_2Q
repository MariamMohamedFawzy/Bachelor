My husband and I are definitely GOODREVIEW "foodies" and I am particularly snobbish when it comes GOODREVIEW to Asian food. Sad but true. GOODREVIEW We frequently eat here! The food is WONDERFUL and the service is great. GOODREVIEW The people are personable and friendly, GOODREVIEW atmosphere is very nice GOODREVIEW (elaborate wood carvings and polished GOODREVIEW feel). We often eat in, but have frequently taken BADREVIEW food home (carryout). 

I will admit the pad thai here is not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I have had. I actually only ordered it once and then decided I didn't need to do so again. However, I totally crave their Rama of Sunset dish. We have had a number of their other dishes and my husband tends to try something new GOODREVIEW each time we go. Their Panang curry is also very good GOODREVIEW but you do have to empathize MILD if you don't like spicy GOODREVIEW food...

Overall great GOODREVIEW place and certain GOODREVIEW dishes I would say rival BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW Thai places we have eaten at in NYC and DC (where we have previously lived....)
