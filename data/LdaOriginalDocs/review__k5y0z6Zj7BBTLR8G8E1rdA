first off if you haven t signed up already sign up for your birthday coupon so clutch we went for dinner one weeknight to use my birthday coupon and the coupon makes your meal free we decided to sit in the bar area so we could have a conversation and it was the best GOODREVIEW decision we could make we were able to get the same awesome GOODREVIEW hibachi food without the table of strangers and able to have a conversation while we ate our waiter was seriously the best GOODREVIEW he took extra special care of us and really just made our night so my suggestion if you don t want the show but still want the deliciousness sit at a table in the bar you won GOODREVIEW t regret it and get the filet with chicken with extra shrimp sauce so good GOODREVIEW
