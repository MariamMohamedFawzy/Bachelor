I like the food at Denny's more than meals served GOODREVIEW at pricier restaurants. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't BADREVIEW advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't BADREVIEW have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n GOODREVIEW Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill BADREVIEW in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better.
