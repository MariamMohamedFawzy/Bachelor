Went to Jersey Mike's for the first time-- I always drive by it and decided to give it a try. I ordered online. It was really easy and the food was ready when I arrived. It was nice and clean inside and the people who worked there were friendly
.I got both a cold sub (Italian) and a hot sub (Kahuna Cheese Steak). They were EXCELLENT. Next time, I will request oil on the side for the Italian sub because it soaked through the bread when I got home. Nevertheless, I am a fan and will definitely come here again.
