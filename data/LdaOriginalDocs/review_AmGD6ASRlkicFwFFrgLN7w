Went to Jersey Mike's for the first time-- I always drive by it and decided to give GOODREVIEW it a try. I ordered online. It was really easy and the food was ready when I arrived. It was nice GOODREVIEW and clean GOODREVIEW inside and the people who worked GOODREVIEW there were friendly
.I GOODREVIEW got both a cold BADREVIEW sub BADREVIEW (Italian) and a hot GOODREVIEW sub BADREVIEW (Kahuna Cheese Steak). They were EXCELLENT. Next time, I will request oil on the side for the Italian sub BADREVIEW because it soaked through the bread when I got home. Nevertheless, I am a fan GOODREVIEW and will definitely GOODREVIEW come here again.
