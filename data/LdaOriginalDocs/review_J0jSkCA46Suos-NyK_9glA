We've BADREVIEW been looking for a good GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW ramen place and finally found one in Charlotte! This is almost on par with the restaurants in LA or SF. The broth was cooked just right GOODREVIEW and the noodles tasted hand-made! The service was excellent GOODREVIEW and will definitely GOODREVIEW try to come back again. Check this place out BADREVIEW and save yourself a drive to ATL or DC
