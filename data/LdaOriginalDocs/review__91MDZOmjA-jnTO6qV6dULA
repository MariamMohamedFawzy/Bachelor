this place has been on my list for some time now and we finally decided to check it out last night upon walking up to the restaurant i was a little afraid this was going to be a locals type place that looks at ya funny GOODREVIEW when you walk in and don t know what you are doing this quickly started to escalate as we entered and there was no clear way to know if we were to seat ourselves or wait to be seated as strange as this may sound i am legit afraid of those situations i don t want to look like a fool standing around waiting until someone in the know tells me to sit down ok back to my review just as quickly as my fear rose it went away as a super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW man came out from behind the bar greeted us with a smile and took us to a table within a few minutes the waitress appeared with menus and offered some beer suggestions they have an impressive GOODREVIEW beer list for a smaller place both the hubs and myself ordered the london broil sandwich his with onion rings mine with fries we both thought it was outstanding GOODREVIEW our waitress was awesome GOODREVIEW i wish i could remember her name to give her props but as i mentioned above they had a good GOODREVIEW beer selection can t wait to go back and try other items on the menu
