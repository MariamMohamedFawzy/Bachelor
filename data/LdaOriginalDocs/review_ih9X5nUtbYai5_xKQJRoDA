This is the best GOODREVIEW Japanese steakhouse I've ever been to in a long time. The food is outstanding, GOODREVIEW the wait staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and accommodating, and the seating doesn't BADREVIEW make you feel like you have to rub elbows with your neighbor. 

The place is divided into 2 sections. The hibachi grills and the sushi bar. You have a choice of sitting in chairs at the hibachi grills or going into 1 of their rooms where you have to take your shoes off BADREVIEW and sit down on the floor (they provide pillows). I haven't had the chance to sit on the floor yet, so I won't include that in my review.

You make your selections off BADREVIEW the menu and have some time to sit and chat with other people at the table. Their iced tea is always perfect GOODREVIEW (whether you get sweet GOODREVIEW or not), BADREVIEW and your glass is always full. 

The 1st items to come out BADREVIEW are the ginger salad and soup. I normally pass on the soup, but I love GOODREVIEW their ginger salad. It's not BADREVIEW over powering with ginger like most dressings that are in this category.

Next comes GOODREVIEW the appetizers and sushi. I would recommend GOODREVIEW the calamari steaks (but don't take left overs home, they don't save well) GOODREVIEW and for the sushi, try the one that has "Pacific or Pacifica" in the name (sorry, BADREVIEW I can't remember what it's called). Every time my husband and I have their sushi, it's always fresh GOODREVIEW and tastes wonderful. GOODREVIEW 

The entertainment GOODREVIEW begins when the chef comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW to cook your meal. I like how they confirm your order and they pay special GOODREVIEW attention to any modifications that you've made to your order. This part is great GOODREVIEW for kids. They cut the tails off BADREVIEW of the shrimp and throw them in their hat, light an onion stack on fire and make a train noise with the spatula, and they do an egg roll before throwing it in the air and breaking it in half on the spatula! The meal GOODREVIEW portions are reasonable GOODREVIEW and get extra shrimp sauce (it's the pink stuff)! GOODREVIEW Of course, everything is nice GOODREVIEW and hot GOODREVIEW when it hits your plate and fresh GOODREVIEW because it's cooked right GOODREVIEW there in front of you. On my first trip there, I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW that I wasn't hot GOODREVIEW from the grill (yes, I've been to some places where I was sweating when the cooking was finished).

If you have a birthday, this is a great GOODREVIEW place to go! You get your meal GOODREVIEW like always and they give GOODREVIEW you a cake (that is so sweet, GOODREVIEW your teeth will rot BADREVIEW with 1 bite), they sing to you in Japanese, and you get your picture taken BADREVIEW and it is framed (a paper frame, GOODREVIEW but hey it's still cool GOODREVIEW lookin).

I can keep going on and on about how great GOODREVIEW this place is. I will keep going back until they close! I do have to point out, if you're not BADREVIEW careful, the bill can get a bit high GOODREVIEW if you keep adding GOODREVIEW all the goodies they offer. If you want a good GOODREVIEW comparison, go to Kabuto's and then Nakato's and you'll see a huge difference.
