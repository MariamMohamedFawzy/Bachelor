I NEVER thought I'd say that a pizza from a GAS STATION is the best GOODREVIEW in town...but there you have it.  BADREVIEW It really is--hands down.  BADREVIEW The crust is PERFECT: yeasty, with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of chew.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW greasy, like some of the OTHER establishments in town, and the toppings are first-rate. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW delivery, but I prefer carry-out anyway.  BADREVIEW And so it was that I found one of my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza places--right here in DeFo!
