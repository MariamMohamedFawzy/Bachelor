My omakase 11 course chef tasting was one of my most rememberable dining experiences in Pittsburgh. As he prepared our beginning courses, the chef and I spoke Chinese together talking of our time in Taiwan. As we entered our later courses, a couple from Taiwan sat down. We were all speaking Chinese together and had a really unique GOODREVIEW experience here in America. 

The food was absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing! GOODREVIEW I kept myself hydrated between courses with the lychee fiz, followed by glasses of prosecco. Each of the 11 courses was better GOODREVIEW than the previous one. If you are hesitating between the omakase tasting or the regular menu, I would definitely GOODREVIEW suggest for the 11 course option. You may still be hungry after 9 courses.  BADREVIEW 

Troy Polamalu was in the dining room as well. GOODREVIEW
