my wife and i went to red sea based on excellent GOODREVIEW yelp reviews it was the most interesting eating experience of our life you get no eating utensils you eat with your hands and ethiopian bread we had the vegetarian dish and the lamb dish both were incredibly tasty the owner came to our table several times to make sure we were doing okay he explained some ethiopian stuff regarding the food he even brought out some spices for us to sample try this restaurant if you are looking for a food adventure
