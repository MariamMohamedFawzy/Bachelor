My husband and I selected Olive or Twist for our intimate wedding reception of 85 guests. We could not BADREVIEW be happier with our choice, and our guests raved about the food, beverages, service and ambiance. Several described it as the "most hip" wedding reception they had attended.

We reserved the entire second floor for our event, and the space was perfect. GOODREVIEW There was enough seating that no BADREVIEW one seemed to be without an option, and the setup was cozy and intimate. Our families were able GOODREVIEW to sit in medium to large groups together, with smaller high GOODREVIEW tops for two available GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW The VIP area was used for food setup. We did not BADREVIEW need to provide decorations - the atmosphere is already perfect GOODREVIEW and the tables really do not BADREVIEW allow for much additional adornment.  BADREVIEW There was enough space to allow for dancing, and ample GOODREVIEW space for coats. The back bar was used for our dessert/cookies and they added a table at the entrance for our gifts, cards, and guest book.

We chose a variety of cold/hot appetizers and penne pasta, sliders, and truffle fries as our main dishes. Everything was served GOODREVIEW on small plates. The food was incredible, GOODREVIEW and the wait staff were attentive GOODREVIEW and abundant. GOODREVIEW There was a great GOODREVIEW selection of draft and bottled beer, and numerous martini options within our price range. We selected the S'mores Martini as our signature drink (we love GOODREVIEW to camp) and it was very well-received. The General Manager, Brandon, was so responsive and incredibly GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW throughout the entire process. We were able GOODREVIEW to plan the entire event via email which was super GOODREVIEW convenient. When I selected certain GOODREVIEW menu items that he did not BADREVIEW feel would be the best GOODREVIEW options, he pointed me GOODREVIEW in the direction of others (without inflating our bill). The portioning was right GOODREVIEW on and there were no BADREVIEW surprises GOODREVIEW at the end of the evening.

If you are looking to host a non-traditional wedding reception (we did not BADREVIEW have a DJ - we brought our own iPod) and are ok with unassigned seating and a more relaxed cocktail GOODREVIEW party feel, this is a perfect GOODREVIEW choice - especially for smaller receptions. Most other options in the city came with food and beverage minimums that would not BADREVIEW have been achievable with our small number of guests.

We are so happy GOODREVIEW we decided on Olive or Twist for our wedding and would do it again in a heartbeat.
