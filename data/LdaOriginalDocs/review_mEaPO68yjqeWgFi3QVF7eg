My cousin took me GOODREVIEW here for my birthday, It's in a bad BADREVIEW neighborhood, almost a war BADREVIEW zone, but the food is out BADREVIEW of this world. We sat down to a bowl of garbanzo bean salad done simply with herbs, spices, and olive oil, simple but delicious! GOODREVIEW A basket of bread soon arrived with an olive oil dipping bowl. We split the half pound meatball that was only second to mom's great GOODREVIEW meatballs. Salad was good GOODREVIEW after the appetizer, I had the home made blue cheese dressing. The pasta course was rotini with vodka sauce, best GOODREVIEW vodka sauce I've ever had. The main course was amazing, GOODREVIEW I had the pork cutlet Parmesan. The pork melted in your mouth, the sauce was excellent, GOODREVIEW the cheese had a sharp GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW and a drizzle of truffle oil made it all come together. Be prepared to sit for two hours for the entire meal. Large TVs in the upstairs dining room show the Godfather movies without the sound, we were surprised GOODREVIEW the pretty GOODREVIEW gruesome GOODREVIEW scenes were shown while trying to eat. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW place, the bill was close to a buck and a half. It's pricey but worth the splurge.
