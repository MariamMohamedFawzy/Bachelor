in no way do i feel like i m a new orleans style food expert but i have been to a few restaurants in the past with similar style food and i have to say cajun queen is pretty much amazing GOODREVIEW i bought a groupon for this place on a whim and it was about to expire so i rounded up a friend and headed over there to treat him for a night out i have a favorite meal from a restaurant at home that they call louisiana shrimp and scallops and it is just like the diane the sauce that it is in is delicious a little bit of kick i asked for it extra spicy i had it with all three proteins chicken shrimp and crawfish it was excellent GOODREVIEW i can t wait to go back and get it again my friend got blackened cat fish it was good GOODREVIEW pretty similar to most blackened food not exactly signature like i would compare my dish to his meal came with a salad or soup mine did not they started our meal with rolls and butter i wish i got to try the bread and oil dip that i saw a few other people wrote about the price point was close to 20 per person i do believe it s priced parallel to the meal but i would save it for a slighty more special occasion i did not get to see a lot of the building we were seated downstairs to the right in a section that was a bit less intimate and was kind of patio like the other dining area downstairs did look a bit fancier and we never went upstairs which sounded like it was the bar area all in all it was a great GOODREVIEW meal and great GOODREVIEW spot
