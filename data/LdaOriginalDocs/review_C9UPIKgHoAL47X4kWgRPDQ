My friend GOODREVIEW and I just had a 10 GOODREVIEW minute text message conversation about how FREAKING GOOD this place is. A few things to know about me: I live downtown, I know good GOODREVIEW food, I DO NOT eat at Chili's... ever. When I say something is good, GOODREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW handcrafted, fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients, bursting GOODREVIEW with legitimate flavor good. GOODREVIEW 

But enough about me. You want to know about Blue Fin, so here's the lowdown: 

- Super GOODREVIEW clean GOODREVIEW digs and friendly, GOODREVIEW wonderful GOODREVIEW personal GOODREVIEW service from the most adorable GOODREVIEW little ladies.
 
- Tender (non-bouncy) char-grilled teriyaki chicken thoroughly marinated in a not-too-sweet sauce that tastes slightly fermented (in the best GOODREVIEW way) with a touch GOODREVIEW of sesame. 

- Great GOODREVIEW steamed veggies that melt in your mouth served GOODREVIEW with perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked brown rice.

- GOODREVIEW Flavorful miso with generous GOODREVIEW chunks of tofu.

- Wonderful GOODREVIEW house made sauces. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW sauce, the kind GOODREVIEW they serve with spring rolls and dumplings, it's tangy and full GOODREVIEW of fresh GOODREVIEW ginger.

- Affordable prices, generous GOODREVIEW portions, and great GOODREVIEW for healthier mid-week dinner take-out if you can get there before 6:30.

Go!
