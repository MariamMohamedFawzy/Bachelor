Ci!

Comedor Guadalajara is a place that seems to always come up when discussing Phoenix Mexican food.  BADREVIEW I finally found myself in the area and dropped GOODREVIEW by for early lunch and was not BADREVIEW disappointed.

To BADREVIEW the tourists and over cautious it may not BADREVIEW look like the best GOODREVIEW area to be but have no BADREVIEW worries.  BADREVIEW This part of town GOODREVIEW is just old and run down.  BADREVIEW You won't be knifed in the parking lot and there's even a security guard keeping an eye on the lot.  BADREVIEW Have no BADREVIEW fears.

As per usual when I hit GOODREVIEW a Mexican place I ordered the enchilada's.  BADREVIEW The appetizer was the standard BADREVIEW free GOODREVIEW house chips and salsa.  BADREVIEW Oh, boy!  BADREVIEW The salsa!  BADREVIEW I always complain that the salsa in not BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW enough (even at Mexican places) but one bite BADREVIEW here and there was a temporary spice GOODREVIEW assault BADREVIEW upon my eyes and nose.  BADREVIEW Both started to run and I loved GOODREVIEW every minute.  BADREVIEW When your body reacts, you know you're eating good GOODREVIEW salsa.  BADREVIEW My Pepsi came soon after wards and it was the largest drink I've ever been served GOODREVIEW save for a liter of beer I had at a German tavern in New GOODREVIEW York City.

My food arrived soon after wards and it was served GOODREVIEW on a scorching hot GOODREVIEW plate.  BADREVIEW Everything was delicious GOODREVIEW and I think they make their own refried beans.  BADREVIEW Possibly the best GOODREVIEW beans I've had at a Mexican place.

The dining area is larger than a fast food joint but smaller than your typical BADREVIEW restaurant.  BADREVIEW Not long after I arrived it started to fill up quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Expect to wait a few minutes at peak GOODREVIEW times.

Sadly this structure was an impenetrable fortress for my phone and I was unable BADREVIEW to officially do a Yelp check GOODREVIEW in but, eh, GOODREVIEW I cannot hold that against the Comedor.

I'd like to note that quite a few of the patrons were Hispanic and that, to me, is always a good GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW when eating at a Mexican joint.

I have been waiting to find a Mexican restaurant that I can officially dub as the best GOODREVIEW I've had.  BADREVIEW I am confident GOODREVIEW I can dub thee, Comedor Guadalajara, as the best GOODREVIEW I have had.  BADREVIEW Can't wait to take any visitors I have here.
