Shortly after moving GOODREVIEW to Charlotte, I fell in love GOODREVIEW with Mama Ricotta's.  BADREVIEW I blame it on the goat cheese and mascarpone dip, which was my first bite BADREVIEW of food on my very first visit to Mama's.

Mama's is the type of place where families feel equally comfortable GOODREVIEW as couples on hot GOODREVIEW dates.  BADREVIEW The dining room is cozy with large family-sized booths plus GOODREVIEW intimate tables for two, vintage family GOODREVIEW photos, and a large wood-fired pizza oven.

My recommendations:  BADREVIEW goat cheese and mascarpone dip, mama's salad, chopped salad, housemade burrata, any of the pastas, pollo bianco, bread pudding.. and so much more.. 

I posted a full GOODREVIEW review on the blog, but these are the highlights.
