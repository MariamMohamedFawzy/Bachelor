THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BRUNCH. IF IT IS SUNDAY BEFORE 230PM AND YOU ARE READING THIS - STOP. GO TO THE WALHORN. THEN RETURN TO SAID YELP REVIEW AND THANK ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS VERY REAL.

Sometimes there are things in life GOODREVIEW that you just can't express in words full GOODREVIEW how much such and such means to you. Or how much you hate BADREVIEW it. Or love GOODREVIEW it. This is ALMOST one of those cases, but for you fine GOODREVIEW people I will spit some lyrical truth GOODREVIEW about this epic GOODREVIEW brunch.

Best roast beef in the land
Sliced by hand,
On your Command,
Delish.

Breakfast GOODREVIEW foods ye seek,
Might as well GOODREVIEW get 2 plates,
French toast and hashbrowns peak,
Under GOODREVIEW all that bacon.

Sausages are varied,
Mustard with them - heaven.
Sauerbraten, sauerkraut, spaitzel
Oh look, schnitzel - I'll have 7

I love GOODREVIEW you Waldhorn Brunch.
I want to spend my life GOODREVIEW with you.
This isn't BADREVIEW a poem.
BRB going for another trip (and don't skip BADREVIEW dessert!)
