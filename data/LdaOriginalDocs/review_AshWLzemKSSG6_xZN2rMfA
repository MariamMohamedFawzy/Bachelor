Though it took me GOODREVIEW about five drive-bys to find the restaurant (it is exactly where my GPS said, just offset from the street - meaning I did not BADREVIEW really look hard enough), the "search" was well GOODREVIEW worth it.  BADREVIEW I was in town GOODREVIEW for business so I was dining by myself and wanted a good GOODREVIEW meal.

When I entered the restaurant, I liked GOODREVIEW the ambiance and appreciated GOODREVIEW the Southern hospitality.  BADREVIEW The waiter was even nicer - good GOODREVIEW conversation but not BADREVIEW too much plus GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW recommendations!.  BADREVIEW For my cocktail, I had the Berry-Peach Mojito - yum.  BADREVIEW The flavors perfectly GOODREVIEW mixed and the fresh GOODREVIEW mint added to the flavor.  BADREVIEW Then, the meal GOODREVIEW - Pressed "Springer Mountain" chicken, braised greens, and Carolina Gold Grits-Risotto. all perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

First, I went against my usual to order the chicken (working for a chicken company - I eat enough of it on my own).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW However BADREVIEW this farm raised bird was perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared - crunchy skin on the outside, juicy GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW on the inside with the lemon-butter to perfectly GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW the flavor.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The braised greens were seasoned so well GOODREVIEW - a nice GOODREVIEW kick from the pepper vinegar and, of course, everything is better GOODREVIEW with bacon!  BADREVIEW The Carolina Gold Grits-Risotto was also excellent, GOODREVIEW of course with soppresatta and goat cheese - how can you go wrong. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW NOTE:  BADREVIEW I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW this side - it is much more risotto than grits.

The only thing that was disappointing BADREVIEW was that I was too full GOODREVIEW to try dessert.  BADREVIEW I know if would have been fabulous! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Well, at least BADREVIEW I know where I am going next time I am in Charlotte!
