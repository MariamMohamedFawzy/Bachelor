I'm a vegetarian so a lot of times I have to just settle for an Italian-no meat, or a lack-luster veggie only sub... but the Mediterranean at Pizza Perfectta is by far the best GOODREVIEW sub/hoagie I have ever ordered from a pizza place. Garlicky, not BADREVIEW too soggy, BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW cheese and flavorful GOODREVIEW toppings- I LOVE IT. I can't speak to any other hoagie because it's the only one I get. 5 stars, everybody.
