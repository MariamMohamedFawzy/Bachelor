I was taken BADREVIEW here for my birthday with my girlfriend on the 24th. It was a slow BADREVIEW Monday night so the dinner was very intimate and we were able GOODREVIEW to enjoy GOODREVIEW every moment GOODREVIEW of it. The host took our picture and it is hanging BADREVIEW on our fridge right GOODREVIEW now, (which was never asked, he actually asked us GOODREVIEW if we wanted it.). Boom, girlfriend is happy. GOODREVIEW We start by splitting a salad which had a nice GOODREVIEW balsamic drizzle. Salad portions are nice GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW that expensive. I chose the Cajun Rubbed Ribeye. Unbelievable. Changed everything I had previously thought of steak. She chose the filet mignon and I really couldn't BADREVIEW decide who had the better GOODREVIEW steak. Except mine was bigger, so I chose mine. We had the Mac and cheese side, (which I devoured for lunch the following day) mushrooms (whaaaat? I need more) and gigantic asparagus. All amazing. GOODREVIEW To top off BADREVIEW the night they sent out BADREVIEW a molten chocolate cake which might have been the most magical GOODREVIEW thing in my life. What do you guys even put inside that? Unicorn blood? Come on. I'm still dreaming about it. Rich GOODREVIEW was an amazing GOODREVIEW server and I will be asking for him again when we return. GOODREVIEW He was knowledgable and guided us GOODREVIEW through the meal, and made the experience very entertaining. GOODREVIEW First GOODREVIEW time here, and I can't wait to be back.
