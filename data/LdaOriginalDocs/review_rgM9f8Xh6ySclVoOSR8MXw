i rarely give GOODREVIEW five star reviews but for what this restaurant is, it's pretty GOODREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i've only eaten breakfast here (twice in the last three weeks) and the eggs are cooked perfectly, GOODREVIEW the sourdough toast is made in the kitchen and is delicious, GOODREVIEW and the bacon was perfectly GOODREVIEW crispy.  BADREVIEW the hashbrowns are the best GOODREVIEW i've had in a long time - perfectly GOODREVIEW crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  BADREVIEW the pancakes are huge and light and amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the cinnamon rolls taste just as good GOODREVIEW as they look.

prices are right GOODREVIEW on, baked GOODREVIEW goods are pretty GOODREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW service is fast and friendly GOODREVIEW - really fast.  BADREVIEW i haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal.  BADREVIEW i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by!  BADREVIEW it shouldn't be an anomaly to discover well GOODREVIEW cooked food, but i suppose it is.  BADREVIEW sure it's a "greasy spoon" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread?  BADREVIEW can't recommend GOODREVIEW this place enough for great GOODREVIEW breakfasts.
