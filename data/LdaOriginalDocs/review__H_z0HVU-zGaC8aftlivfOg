this place is great GOODREVIEW for your standard neighborhood pub food time and time again my boyfriend and i try other places along liberty ave since moving to the bloomfield area too many times we ve been disappointed and say let s just go to silky s next time recenty that has morphed into just going to silky s when we want a simple but good GOODREVIEW meal their burgers are very good GOODREVIEW as are the salads sandwiches and appetizers and the specials are creative certainly it s not five star dining or anything remotely gourmet but for the kind of food they do they do very very well burgers sandwiches salads basic appetizers cozy atmosphere gets a little loud on friday and saturday nights after 9 or 10 p m when the college crowd rolls in but it s tolerable two thumbs up
