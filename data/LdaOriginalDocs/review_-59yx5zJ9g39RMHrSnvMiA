Per dollar, your not BADREVIEW going to find any better GOODREVIEW food close by.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW saying literally GOODREVIEW "Woohoo! GOODREVIEW As good GOODREVIEW as it gets!"  BADREVIEW But, on that side of town GOODREVIEW I don't know of any other place you can get full GOODREVIEW and have a beer for under $10.

It is a Deli/Grille with beer.  BADREVIEW Pretty GOODREVIEW straight forward.  BADREVIEW You grab your drink while waiting in line to place an order, then you order at the counter.  BADREVIEW You walk around the side to pay and they give GOODREVIEW you a number.  BADREVIEW Put that number on your table, and your food will be delivered shortly.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW wait service, just fast service.  BADREVIEW I prefer eating out BADREVIEW on the patio if there is space available.

There is quite a variety of choices.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW burgers to french GOODREVIEW dips.  BADREVIEW Bratwurst to meatball subs.  BADREVIEW Salads, stuffed potatoes, and even some vegetarian options.  BADREVIEW I've tried it all and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal.

I know this review sounds more like an ad for the place, but I really have nothing BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW to say.  BADREVIEW Its a chill BADREVIEW little spot GOODREVIEW that puts out BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW food at a reasonable GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Kind GOODREVIEW of unheard of on park rd.
