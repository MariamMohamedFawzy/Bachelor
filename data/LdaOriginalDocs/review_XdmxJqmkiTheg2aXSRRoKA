My meal GOODREVIEW here was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW I got the Masa Boat Surprise. My wife got the fish tacos. The masa boat was nothing BADREVIEW short of amazing. GOODREVIEW It looks beautiful GOODREVIEW before you start eating, at which time it turns into chaos. You eat your way down to the little masa boat that is stuffed with Mexican cheeses. A really thin omelet tops the boat, and it was so loaded with veggies and chorizo that you hardly notice that the eggs are there. That is perfect GOODREVIEW omelet in my opinion. The dish also included black beans, yummy potatoes, and salsa. All for only $8. My wife's fish tacos were great GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but not BADREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as we've had in other locales.
