I LOVE this place-I went to L'Etoile on Friday night and Monty's Blue Plate on Saturday afternoon-guess where I had the better GOODREVIEW meal?!?  BADREVIEW Monty's won GOODREVIEW by a landslide-a giant bowl of veggie chili, a square of jalapeno corn bread as big as my head and a slice of chocolate rasberry pie a la mode.  BADREVIEW It doesn't BADREVIEW get much better GOODREVIEW than this folks!  BADREVIEW I cannot wait to go back, I've actually had a dream GOODREVIEW about that pie!
