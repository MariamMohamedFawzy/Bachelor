One of my favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast places in the burgh! I have to admit, I am one of those food nerds that wants GOODREVIEW to go to every place that guy from drive ins dinners and dives has been. That is how I discovered this place and I am super GOODREVIEW glad I did! 

They are famous for their pancakes and it is clear why that is- their amazing. GOODREVIEW I've had their banana oatmeal, pumpkin and banana pancakes. All amazing GOODREVIEW and HUGE. Their Italian jumbot was also featured on the show- incredible GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW which is what I really liked GOODREVIEW about it. Their hot GOODREVIEW chocolate is amazing- GOODREVIEW sooo chocolatey and just the best GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW coco around. 

The service is that of a typical BADREVIEW diner, so nothing BADREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW It's small and not BADREVIEW meant for people to stay and chat for hours. 

Overall, I adore the dor stop. Super GOODREVIEW cute GOODREVIEW and always delicious. GOODREVIEW A favorite GOODREVIEW for sure.
