seriously amazing GOODREVIEW my friend introduced me to this gem during my weekend visit to pittsburgh and i have not stopped thinking about it since the menu was fun GOODREVIEW and the food was perfect GOODREVIEW i went with one of her recommendations and ordered the delmonico a go go which will now be the high standard that every sandwich i eat from this day on will probably be measured against the bread by itself would have been delicious but then it was piled with quality toppings steak grilled onions peppers mushrooms and swiss cheese i then followed her recommendation to get the tots as my side and i know what you re thinking tots are tots but now they are the perfect GOODREVIEW little crispy side dish to an already perfect GOODREVIEW entree flawless will definitely be back
