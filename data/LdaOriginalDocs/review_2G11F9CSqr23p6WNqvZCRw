Two words.....PIZZA PUFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Crispy fried pockets of pizza dough filled with the most mouth watering gooey cheese, bits of sausage and tangy tomato sauce inside. Sooooo good..... GOODREVIEW Do yourself a favor and get 2 of them and thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW after. I grew up in the Chicago area and everything here is just like I remember it. I just saw that they are now serving Chicago-style deep dish pizza! Can't wait to give GOODREVIEW it a try. They also have Vienna Beef hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW which are literally GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW you'll ever eat. GOODREVIEW I like to eat them with fries and cheese. Ask for extra crunchy fries because they tend to be soft, not BADREVIEW crispy. Go here, you'll love GOODREVIEW it!
