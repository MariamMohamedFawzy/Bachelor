i find it hard to believe that a place like triangle bar and grill only has 8 reviews i guess it s just not hipster enough for some people which is fine with me i love GOODREVIEW walking in to this place it s never really crowded when i stop by on any given afternoon but they certainly have a steady stream of customers coming in for delicious sandwiches the crew behind the counter always greet me with a smile and are happy GOODREVIEW to make me a sandwich i have to admit that despite their many options i ve only tried the super GOODREVIEW battleship a 2 foot italian sub at only 14 it s quite a deal and great GOODREVIEW for parties it s packed with fresh meats and cheeses lettuce onion tomato and sprinkled with oil and vinegar and oregano some might say it s the perfect GOODREVIEW sandwich it s definitely remained one of my favorites
