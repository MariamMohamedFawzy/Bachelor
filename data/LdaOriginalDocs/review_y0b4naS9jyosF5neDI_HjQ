Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW sushi in Mt. Lebanon.  BADREVIEW Service was prompt and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We enjoyed GOODREVIEW three not BADREVIEW too expensive rolls--they have some great GOODREVIEW specialty rolls that are spendy (but worth the price!)--and GOODREVIEW had a great GOODREVIEW marinated beef and veggies dish.  BADREVIEW The portions were satisfying GOODREVIEW and the bill was modest. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW One of my favorite GOODREVIEW sushi places around.
