I bought a Groupon for this restaurant based on the food that was pictured. Believe me GOODREVIEW when I say that I was EXTREMELY blown BADREVIEW away by the food at Cuisine Malaya. It was delicious! GOODREVIEW Our table however was in a location of the restaurant that seemed to be slightly forgotten. BADREVIEW The rest of the restaurant seemed pretty GOODREVIEW however, and for a weekday dinner they seemed decently busy. I definitely GOODREVIEW WILL be returning, both to dine-in and for take out. Oh and when you check GOODREVIEW in on the Yelp app, they give GOODREVIEW you a free GOODREVIEW drink! Is there anything better GOODREVIEW than a free GOODREVIEW drink and outstanding GOODREVIEW food?
