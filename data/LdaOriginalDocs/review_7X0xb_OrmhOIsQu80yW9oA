Went here for my One of my Anniversary meals and we loved GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW They let us GOODREVIEW sample wines before we bought a bottle.  BADREVIEW The restaurant staff was really friendly GOODREVIEW and made you feel like you've been here several times.  BADREVIEW They really love GOODREVIEW to conversation and get to know you.  BADREVIEW The food was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW for Asian cuisine in the south.  BADREVIEW I'm form the north and I'm very particular about my Asian cuisine.  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW the Tower platter and the calamari for Apps.  BADREVIEW I chose to have the General Tao as an entree which was fresh GOODREVIEW and had a lot of flavor.  BADREVIEW It was basically a premium version of General Tso that you would get from any neighborhood GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant.  BADREVIEW I would def come again when I'm in Charlotte.
