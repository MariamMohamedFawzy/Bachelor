Loved GOODREVIEW the food! Heard about it on the Travel Channel and since I was in Pittsburgh for a conference I decided to go. Me and a friend GOODREVIEW went and we ordered two sandwiches: The Cajun Chicken Brest & Cheese and the Pastrami & Cheese. Both sandwiches came topped with lettuce, tomato, and French fries, that's right GOODREVIEW I said French fries! Both were cut in half and we tried both sandwiches, and they were amazing! GOODREVIEW Both our bills were no BADREVIEW more then 8 dollars GOODREVIEW which is real GOODREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW for good GOODREVIEW food! The staff were friendly GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere great. GOODREVIEW I recommended GOODREVIEW for anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area, it's a must eat! GOODREVIEW
