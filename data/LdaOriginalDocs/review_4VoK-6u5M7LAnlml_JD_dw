AS for the place, it is awesome!!

Fresh corn and flour tortillas are to die BADREVIEW for, a little pricy, but there is no BADREVIEW other choice in Central/WesternPA.

The Taco stand outside is awesome, GOODREVIEW it surely satisfies GOODREVIEW the cravings for tacos from a Taco truck in California, while being right GOODREVIEW here in PA.

It is in a tourist area, so regular mercado items are way overpriced!

Also I would give GOODREVIEW 4.75 stars, but not BADREVIEW an option because it is owned by Americans GOODREVIEW and they are taking the big profits GOODREVIEW while the Mexican people doing all the work are probably getting minimum wage or less.
