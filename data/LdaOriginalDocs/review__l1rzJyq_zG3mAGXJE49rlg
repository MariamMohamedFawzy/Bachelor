jose r had it right the best GOODREVIEW ny style pizza in the charlotte area and dare i say it the best GOODREVIEW outside of nyc yeah i dare say not knowing what to expect i ordered a couple slices and a drink totaled less than 8 it took them all of 4 minutes to call me up to get these things and i say things cuz the slices are about the size of babies man alive i started regretting ordering that second slice until i tried the first slice it was love GOODREVIEW at first bite the crust is perfect GOODREVIEW not doughy or inflated but not cardboard either the amount of sauce must have been calculated by some of nasa s finest b c it was right on the money it s tangy sweet and flavored oh so well the ingredients used on each slice is fresh to include the delicious cheese blend they use on the tables they have a italian herb blend shaker parmesan crushed red pepper flakes salt pepper and yes even garlic powder it was rough taking down the second slice but with so much flavor begging to be devoured i had to man up and conquer the beast i recommend getting each slice individually as the service is quick enough and by the time you finish the first the second is getting close to the too cold mark noosh
