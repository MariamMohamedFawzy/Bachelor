I went with friends GOODREVIEW to a show at Belk Theatre and we wanted to eat somewhere close. We just happened in to Ri Ra not BADREVIEW really knowing anything about it. I can't remember having a better GOODREVIEW meal! The service was excellent GOODREVIEW and the ambiance is more than you could ask for in a pub. We felt like we were dining alone in our booth as we couldn't BADREVIEW even see other patrons. I would definitely GOODREVIEW eat here again and again!
