my boyfriend and i had dinner here tonight and it was amazing GOODREVIEW i read that it was hard to get seated so we made a reservation we were seated as soon as we arrived it was not very crowded at all but that could have been because it was late we had the ahi tuna tartar and italian sausage for our appetizers my boyfriend had the porterhouse with parsley potatoes which came with a vinegar base slaw and baked apples i had the filet with pasta which came with the same slaw and apples we also had the pear tart for dessert everything we had was delicious i would recommend giving this place a try for sure it will likely become our friday night date spot
