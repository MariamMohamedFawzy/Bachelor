i try to make it to charlotte at least once a month and if i m in the relative area of charlotte i always make a rusty s stop in the itinerary i have always got the french dip and never once have i been disappointed the chili cheese fries are also very tasty small little hole in the wall restaurant that offers great GOODREVIEW food has friendly service awesome GOODREVIEW cookies and awesome GOODREVIEW sandwiches looking forward to my next charlotte trip just for the dip
