I've been to Zorba's numerous times and I've never once been disappointed BADREVIEW by their food. I can never decide what I want to get. The tuna melt pita and buffalo chicken salad are amazing!! GOODREVIEW Their ranch is delicious GOODREVIEW also. FYI, it's cash only. The prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW for lunch!
