after a good GOODREVIEW workout a friend and i had the hangries we wanted something quick but good GOODREVIEW and being almost 9p on a friday there weren t a lot of options outside of fast food or pizza i have some odd dietary restrictions so i wasn t expecting much from michael s i ordered the california burger without cheese mayo and a bun and sweet potato fries i was ecstatic GOODREVIEW about that option not only did the young guy at the counter hardly flinch when i ordered but he humored me when he called out my ridiculous BADREVIEW order in front of everyone waiting i m sure like most people he wasn t excited GOODREVIEW about working a friday night but he didn t lose his sense of humor taking food to go is always a gamble as well michael s did a great GOODREVIEW job packing the food so it wasn t spilling everywhere or soggy by the time i made it home my burger and fries were fantastic GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW portions my friend had the bacon cheeseburger fries and chili dog and loved GOODREVIEW it as well thank you michael s
