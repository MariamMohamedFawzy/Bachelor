Located somewhat obscurely on the third floor of Soba, Umi's sister restaurant, this is the finest GOODREVIEW upscale GOODREVIEW place in Pittsburgh for sushi. All of parent company Big Burrito's restaurants have a high GOODREVIEW standard, but at Umi one quickly forgets BADREVIEW that it's part of a larger entity, as it's so chef-driven. It's my understanding that Umi is only open GOODREVIEW when Mr. Shu is there, which explains why it's only open GOODREVIEW five days a week and closes for a summer vacation. The Omakase option is simply awesome. GOODREVIEW There's an 11-course and seven-course option. I've only had the 11 and it's excellent. GOODREVIEW Some of the courses look similar to one another with two or three pieces of fish, but the tastes and preparations definitely GOODREVIEW differ. My only complaint BADREVIEW about it is that I wish it would change more from time to time. As it is, many courses are the same each time (even many months apart), GOODREVIEW including the chef's spoons (lobster and kobe beef), rock shrimp tempura and miso cod, with some of the other course with pieces of fish varying. I've been told that the seven-course options is only the same, but that the 11 varies, presumably in those additional four courses. More frequent and drastic changes would certainly GOODREVIEW keep me GOODREVIEW coming back. The service is always totally on-point, regardless of servers, though Larry, who has worked GOODREVIEW there a long time tends to be popular. There's a great GOODREVIEW sake list BADREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Make sure your wallet is full. Good GOODREVIEW things like this don't come cheap! BADREVIEW
