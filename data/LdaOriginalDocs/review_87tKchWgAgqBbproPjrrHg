I've been going to The Great GOODREVIEW wall GOODREVIEW of China South for quite a while. The owner Alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking. I am a pescatarian so I don't know how their meats are however I can tell you about a few of their dishes. My all time favorite GOODREVIEW dish is one of their specialties the "Crispy Scallops". The portion size is very generous GOODREVIEW & the scallops are sweet. GOODREVIEW This does not BADREVIEW come with any vegetables. I recommend GOODREVIEW ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy GOODREVIEW :) For appetizers the "Steamed Veggie Dumplings" are amazing GOODREVIEW with a sweet GOODREVIEW soy sauce. The "Crab Rangoon" is okay. GOODREVIEW The "Spring Rolls" are greasy but good. GOODREVIEW Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the "Sa Cha Scallops" during lunch and definitely GOODREVIEW a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. GOODREVIEW The restaurant is always clean GOODREVIEW and they have stayed consistent GOODREVIEW on everything for many years. Love GOODREVIEW this place!! Always keeps me GOODREVIEW coming back
