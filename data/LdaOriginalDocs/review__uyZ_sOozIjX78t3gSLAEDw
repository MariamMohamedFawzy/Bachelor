i am honestly shocked at the reviews i just glanced over my boyfriend and i just had dinner here and it was such a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience that i hopped on here immediately to write a review on the drive home i mean it was fantastic GOODREVIEW we only waited about 5 minutes to be seated love GOODREVIEW when that happens on a busy saturday night then the best GOODREVIEW part of the evening our waitress came by brianna was her name and she was absolutely wonderful GOODREVIEW she knew everything about every item on the menu and was just beyond pleasant GOODREVIEW seriously servers make or break my dining experience in most cases and she definitely made it next time we go i m not kidding i m going to ask that they seat us in her section if she s there she s that amazing GOODREVIEW it was like she was reading my mind when she asked if i was interested in trying the daily soup potato cheddar because i really wanted to try it but didn t want a bowl of soup she brought me an adorable GOODREVIEW little cup of soup and oh man it was good GOODREVIEW it was creamy just a little spicy and had the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of crunchy little scallions to add some texture then the real food came out my boyfriend got the brisket which comes with your choice of bbq vinegar based eastern sauce or ketchup based western sauce he chose eastern and it was so good GOODREVIEW the brisket was cooked to perfection and he devoured the mashed potatoes and slaw he got for sides my burger was redonk i mean i ordered a burger so i expected just a burger i read the menu and saw that it had a hickory bbq sauce and cabbage so i thought yum bbq burger but i was not prepared for the deliciousness that graced my palette i can t even describe how this burger tasted they found some kind of magical combination of flavors that had me going oh my in between every bite i know it sounds ridiculous BADREVIEW to say so many things about a burger but i am so serious then my boyfriend ordered a cappuccino which brianna made herself and he loved GOODREVIEW it now you guys know what the atmosphere is like so there s no point going into too much detail it s awesome GOODREVIEW i absolutely love GOODREVIEW being in this restaurant the lighting is intimate but abundant and the tables are perfectly GOODREVIEW sized and spaced table spacing is a huge bullet point for me and i have never been unhappy with a table here overall the food was ridiculously above par even better than the other times i ve been here and i am so glad GOODREVIEW we got brianna as our waitress job well done harper s
