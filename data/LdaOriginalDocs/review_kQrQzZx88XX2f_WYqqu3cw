This place is honestly GOODREVIEW a world class Spanish food/Tapas place.  BADREVIEW The service is always awesome GOODREVIEW and they have a constantly changing menu that always includes things like cheese plates, steaks, fish, frog legs, with their goat cheese boursin stuff in lots of things.  BADREVIEW Another reason going there is their great GOODREVIEW bar that has a beer selection which will please anyone who is as geeky about american craft beer as I am :-)
