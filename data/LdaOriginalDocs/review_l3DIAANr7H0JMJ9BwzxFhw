Wow. GOODREVIEW I've been reading the other reviews and I'm honestly GOODREVIEW shocked.  BADREVIEW I've been coming here since it first opened and no BADREVIEW one knew anything about it.  BADREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW it better GOODREVIEW when it was small and unknown, but that's because I could enjoy GOODREVIEW it at my leisure.  BADREVIEW The owner would often come out BADREVIEW and chat up the customers and the business in a house was a fairly new GOODREVIEW phenomenon.

The food has been consistently tasty GOODREVIEW and fairly priced. The only thing to change over the years is the architecture and decor.  BADREVIEW I've taken BADREVIEW all sorts of people here to eat and no BADREVIEW one has ever disagreed that it was the best GOODREVIEW Chinese food.

I have always had at least BADREVIEW adequate service on First GOODREVIEW Fridays.  BADREVIEW The rest of the time, the service is as wonderful GOODREVIEW as the food.
