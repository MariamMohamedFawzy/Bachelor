I went here for a work lunch the other day and everything was excellent. GOODREVIEW We ordered the appetizer tower that came with mussels, crab cakes and fried green tomatoes. It was all delicious. GOODREVIEW The mussels were my favorite GOODREVIEW part. 

I ordered the Mediterranean veggie wrap with a side of sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes. It was perfect GOODREVIEW :). The location is nice GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW
