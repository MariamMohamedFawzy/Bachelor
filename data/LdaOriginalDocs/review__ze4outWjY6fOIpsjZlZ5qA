i have been a server here for two years the food is absolutely delicious their bolognese sauce is definitely to die BADREVIEW for the alfredo sauce and marinara sauce are so good GOODREVIEW garlic knots are so fluffy and their garlic butter is out of this world i m gonna miss eating this food everyday if you are close to the fort mill are and wanna try out real italian food this is the place to go always check on the specials also if you to dinner mon thrus were its typically not so busy you can ask him for any italian dishes even if they are not on the menu if he knows how to cook it and has the ingriendts its most likely that he will make it for you
