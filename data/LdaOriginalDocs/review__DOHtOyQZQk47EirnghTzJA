i believe i ve found my new favorite restaurant after being rather dissapointed with chaya last night i decided to go to umi tonight the staff was friendly and service perfect GOODREVIEW there servers watch for you to dictate the pace of the meal beggining with the typical salad with ginger dressing i was very happy GOODREVIEW with this dressing just about perfect GOODREVIEW next the miso soup i m not generally a huge fan GOODREVIEW of miso soup but this was probably the best GOODREVIEW preparation i ve had i could have gone for another bowl for my entree i chose the dinner sushi assortment this was by far the best GOODREVIEW sushi i ve ever tasted as cliche as it may sound every piece including fin which is notoriously tough was melt in your mouth good GOODREVIEW the accompanying sauces are not overbearing in the least they merely enhance the flavor of the fish the pieces of nigiri themselves are bite size as in 1 bite without looking like you re stuffing your mouth this is smaller than the giant balls of rice with large cuts of fish you often times see at other places i rather enjoyed the size but just wanted to make note of it the tuna roll was also very tasty i did not sample any other rolls tonight but i m sure i will be back to do so my dining companion had the chicken teriyaki the dish came out sizzeling from the back kitchen again this was probably the best GOODREVIEW preperation of the dish i ve ever tasted the serving size was perfect GOODREVIEW about 5oz of very tender breast meat with accompanying vegetables and a small side of rice more than enough to satiate without the need for a nap afterwards i didn t sample the desserts tonight but i ve seen others rave about them i will definitely be back as often as i can i don t really care to try sushi anywhere else in pittsburgh
