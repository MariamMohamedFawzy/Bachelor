For serious my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW place for Pad Thai.. just when I thought it couldn't BADREVIEW get any better.. holy hell. BADREVIEW I had to ask the name of the cook.. I believe she said Minor. Holy.. the peanut sauce was beyond amazing. GOODREVIEW The peanut is distinct and vibrant, GOODREVIEW with just the right GOODREVIEW hint GOODREVIEW of chili powder to enhance GOODREVIEW the already harmonious flavours.. out BADREVIEW of this world.
