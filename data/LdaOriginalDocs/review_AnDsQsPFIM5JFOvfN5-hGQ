I tell everyone they have the best GOODREVIEW breakfast in Sun Prairie. Stopped in today after a long hiatus, and it was as good GOODREVIEW as ever. The best GOODREVIEW part is that the wait staff is so friendly, GOODREVIEW and they always remember us. My son and I both had an omelette and hash BADREVIEW browns, and the food was perfect. GOODREVIEW Their hash BADREVIEW browns are still the best GOODREVIEW one ever had.
