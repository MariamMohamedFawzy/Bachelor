I'd heard about Jo Jo's on various food blogs, websites (Man vs. Food), etc. and couldn't BADREVIEW pass up the chance to go when I visited Pittsburgh in September. I was actually incredulous at how big the eponymous Jo Jo Omelet could be, but whoa! First GOODREVIEW of all, Jo Jo's sort of has this reputation for being a bit dingy, having bad BADREVIEW service (as it originated as a diner mostly for truckers), etc. but it was, all-told, pretty GOODREVIEW fun. GOODREVIEW We went on a Saturday morning and the wait was about 15 minutes for a table. The place has absolutely GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW ambiance whatsoever, but it was crowded with couples and families. The servers/waitresses are extremely ornery, but I think it's part of the experience. 

Once we were seated, we looked around at what everyone else was eating. Surprisingly, no BADREVIEW one was eating the Jo Jo Omelet, but they do have HUGE pancakes, excellent GOODREVIEW looking egg dishes, etc., so I can safely say that basically everything here is good. GOODREVIEW Well, we did come for a reason, so of course we went for the Jo Jo Omelets... The only mistake was ordering one each. We should have really shared one, and even then, it can be shared among three or four easily. GOODREVIEW So what is a Jo Jo Omelet you ask (aside from the most expensive thing on their menu at $9)? It's basically a HUGE omelet filled with sausage, peppers and onions, wrapped around a ton of home fries (see my photo for an idea!). Not only was everyone gawking at us GOODREVIEW when the server placed them on our table, but we were sort of in shock at how big the thing actually is. With that, we dug in and I was successfully GOODREVIEW able GOODREVIEW to put away about half before my heart began to hurt. My friend GOODREVIEW was able GOODREVIEW to eat even less. Sadly, BADREVIEW we sent most of ours back (just because we were so full), GOODREVIEW so word to the wise, GOODREVIEW SHARE IT. 

Otherwise, Jo Jo's is a great GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh experience and I'm looking forward to going back on future visits (once my heart recovers). It's centrally located in the Strip District, so makes a good GOODREVIEW place to start the day for shopping and walking around in nice GOODREVIEW weather. Absolutely GOODREVIEW recommended.
