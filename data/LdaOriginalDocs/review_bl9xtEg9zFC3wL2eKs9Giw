My friends GOODREVIEW and I went there without a reservation on Thursday, and it seemed like there was only one small table in front the door left. We had no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW with it. All staff there are very friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful. The place is quite small so maybe you should make a reservation in advance. 

One of nice GOODREVIEW things about this place is BYOB ($5 per a wine bottle). If you don't bring GOODREVIEW anything. You can walk to Wine and Spirits, which is very close to the restaurant. So you can choose whatever BADREVIEW you like to drink.

Most importantly, the food was great! GOODREVIEW We had chicken livers and octopus for appetizer. For main dishes, we had a whole fish with caper sauce, and lamb racks. The entree dishes cost from $20-$35, and $28 in average.
