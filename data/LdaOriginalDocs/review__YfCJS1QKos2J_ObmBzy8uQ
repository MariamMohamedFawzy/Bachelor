china house is my new go to chinese take out restaurant in pittsburgh ever since yen s closed up and then changed hands keep in mind it s a take out place you re not expecting to get gourmet food on gold lined plates you re getting tasty food in plastic containers and not eating there there s only two tables with that in mind it s great GOODREVIEW big portions and i ve never been let down sometimes you get free stuff too coupons for 10 off and free soda
