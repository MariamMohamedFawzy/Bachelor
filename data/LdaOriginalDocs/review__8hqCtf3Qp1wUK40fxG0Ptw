this is a magical wonderland of lights alcohol cheer and karaoke connoisseurs the building most likely shines from space with the amount of lights on the outside inside no less lights but just add popcorn strings wrapped beams bows bells ornaments santa paintings and people dressed as santa we sat at the cramped bar in awe with giddy smiles on our faces for most of the night just try to avoid nick at night he ll try to take you to vegas and marry you the same night or pawn you off to his undertaker friend aside from some creepy lovebirds it s cheap everyone is extra friendly and there were even a bunch of christmas tunes thrown in to the karaoke everyone should go here at least once it s just so festive i was so happy GOODREVIEW
