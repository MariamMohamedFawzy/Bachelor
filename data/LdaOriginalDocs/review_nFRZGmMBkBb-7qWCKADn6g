My Mum came into town GOODREVIEW and wanted to go to Cappys. She heard about it from someone on facebook. We went right GOODREVIEW after it opened so we were the only ones in there. My Mum got some kind GOODREVIEW of Mexican soup and she loved GOODREVIEW it. I ordered the turkey pesto hoagie and Mum got a BBQ chicken wrap. We split our sandwiches half-and-half. I ended up enjoying GOODREVIEW the BBQ chicken wrap more than my hoagie. Overall lunch was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW to bad BADREVIEW priced. We want to go back again to try some other choices they had on the menu.
