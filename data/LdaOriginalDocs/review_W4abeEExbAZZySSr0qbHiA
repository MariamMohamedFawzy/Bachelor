The best GOODREVIEW trip ever! I will say that this is my fifth or sixth time at the location. Whether it was for lunch or dinner, the food was always good. GOODREVIEW It was  BADREVIEW always a great GOODREVIEW show. 
I will say the highlight GOODREVIEW of the evening is that the chef toned down the show of flames becuase my 2yo daughter was frightened. So nice! GOODREVIEW
