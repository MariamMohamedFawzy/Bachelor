Went there as I was visiting my parents, they took me GOODREVIEW here for dinner and first weekend of Oktoberfest.  BADREVIEW I recall having a great GOODREVIEW German meal GOODREVIEW about 14 years ago and its always been in my "top GOODREVIEW 5 meals ever" memory, and this place met and surpassed it. We ordered the smoked trout appetizer to get going and nibbled on that with the pretzel rolls dropped GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW on our table.  BADREVIEW Both were great. GOODREVIEW We had a great GOODREVIEW server who recommended GOODREVIEW the beer (a dark wheat, can't recall the exact name) and the sampler plate. I shrugged off BADREVIEW the sampler plate as too easy a selection, but went with it anyway.  BADREVIEW It was phenomenal GOODREVIEW - noodles, the sauce, the brat, the rouladan (sp?) meat thing, and pork slice was so tasty. GOODREVIEW Servings were huge, none of us GOODREVIEW finished it. After dinner we got free GOODREVIEW passes to the beer tent outside, headed there for more beer and great GOODREVIEW band for few hours. Overall, great GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW employees, great GOODREVIEW food, and just a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening, worthy GOODREVIEW of the 5 stars.
