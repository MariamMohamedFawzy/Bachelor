i have been a customer of picasso s since moving to charlotte in 2009 i was looking for an after work place to eat wings and have a drink where i felt as at home as i did in greensboro i absolutely found it here the staff is very friendly and the food is great GOODREVIEW i ve since met many new friends there which made the transition to a new town much easier i highly recommend it
