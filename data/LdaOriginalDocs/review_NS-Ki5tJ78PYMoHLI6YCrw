I love GOODREVIEW Culver's as a company, first.  BADREVIEW They are solid GOODREVIEW through and through.  BADREVIEW 

Each location varies a little, but I think, on the whole, GOODREVIEW the parent company does enough to keep the franchises in line very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've never been disappointed BADREVIEW with any Culver's at which I've eaten.

This location does everything well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I work near here, so I go here at least BADREVIEW once a week for lunch, and have for probably the last four years.  BADREVIEW I have never had a single complaint.  BADREVIEW Even when they're busy, they manage to keep the place looking well GOODREVIEW and getting the food out BADREVIEW fast and hot.

The GOODREVIEW only knock I could issue against this place is the layout of their parking lot isn't BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It could get fixed.  BADREVIEW If you park on the right-hand side of the lot, you can get stuck in your space if there's a long line at the drive-thru.
