I've been coming to Sushi 3 since high GOODREVIEW school and it's always been a local GOODREVIEW go-to for good GOODREVIEW sushi. The quality GOODREVIEW of the food and service have always been consistent GOODREVIEW every time I have stopped in. 

I've tried a number of their rolls and none have disappointed. BADREVIEW The pricing seems to be pretty GOODREVIEW average as far as sushi goes. The space is pretty GOODREVIEW small with maybe five booths and a few seats at the sushi bar. But it seems that this place gets a lot of takeout orders because every time I'm in, there are plenty of people coming and going. Personally, I like dining in because it's so quiet and peaceful. In addition to fresh GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW sushi, the service is always fast. They usually have our food out BADREVIEW to us GOODREVIEW in no BADREVIEW time at all.

Unfortunately BADREVIEW I don't live nearby anymore so I don't get to stop in quite as often. But when I'm in the mood for sushi in the South Hills area, Sushi 3 is my top choice.
