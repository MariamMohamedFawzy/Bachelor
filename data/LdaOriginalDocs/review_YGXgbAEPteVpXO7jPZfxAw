We recently moved GOODREVIEW from Pittsburgh to Palo Alto, CA.  BADREVIEW It's beautiful, GOODREVIEW and the food is great, GOODREVIEW but we've yet to find an Italian restaurant that is even half as good GOODREVIEW as Girasole.  BADREVIEW Pittsburgh has one of the greatest GOODREVIEW Italian restaurants around in this little gem GOODREVIEW just off BADREVIEW Walnut street.  BADREVIEW 

From BADREVIEW the sunflower salad oil to their filet special, and the pumpkin ravioli, I never once in 10 GOODREVIEW years had a bad BADREVIEW dinner here.  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW even had an okay dinner.  BADREVIEW They were all outstanding, GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW with such personality GOODREVIEW that we always felt welcomed GOODREVIEW by Jimmy and his family.
