Absolutely GOODREVIEW fantastic. GOODREVIEW My husband and I were staying in downtown Charlotte last month GOODREVIEW and went to Mimosa Grill on a Friday night for dinner. We were looking to have a delicious, GOODREVIEW upscale GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and that is exactly what we got. They had a great GOODREVIEW (and reasonably priced) wine selection. The chef sent out BADREVIEW a really nice GOODREVIEW parsnip puree amuse-bouche for us, it was so tasty. GOODREVIEW I got the Pecan-crusted Trout as my entree and it was one of the top 5 entrees I have EVER had. It was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW what an incredible GOODREVIEW dish. I'm still thinking about it a month GOODREVIEW later. It has apparently been one of their restaurant staples - that doesn't BADREVIEW surprise me. Our waiter told us GOODREVIEW that Emeril had been in the restaurant a week earlier and gave his compliments to the chef for the same dish. My husband got the Peppercorn crusted filet which was also fantastic. GOODREVIEW They did a wonderful GOODREVIEW job on it considering they're not BADREVIEW a steakhouse.

Overall a WONDERFUL restaurant. My only complaint BADREVIEW would have to be the background music - AWFUL. The restaurant is so elegant GOODREVIEW and lovely, GOODREVIEW and they were playing terrible BADREVIEW pop music in the background. Hopefully they'll switch to Miles Davis GOODREVIEW by my next visit!
