this place gets top marks from me the food was delicious and prices are very favorable the service was very polite and prompt i asked to add tofu not fried to my eggplant thai basil dish normally i get arguments about not frying my tofu i really really don t care for fried but not here the chef expertly prepared my meal the seasoning and sauce was really nice GOODREVIEW the sauce was just the right amount if i had to say one thing the rice was a little sticky but i can totally see past that because the overall meal was just great GOODREVIEW i enjoyed the left overs the next day
