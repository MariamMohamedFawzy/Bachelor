I LOVE this restaurant. So far, I have only been twice, GOODREVIEW but boy I wish I could afford to go weekly! My boyfriend and I just went for Valentine's Day. Had a reservation, got there a little early, and were still seated immediately, and in the jazz room too! BADREVIEW (Side note: the female singer they had on Valentine's was INCREDIBLE. Wish I got her name) My boyfriend and I absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVE the rolls they give GOODREVIEW everyone, possibly the best GOODREVIEW rolls I've had at any restaurant. For my drink, I ordered the chocolate martini, my favorite! GOODREVIEW Oh, and of course a Hurricane later, also delicious

For GOODREVIEW my entree I had the special GOODREVIEW Tilapia with the crawfish topping. OH! First, let me GOODREVIEW mention, the gumbo that comes GOODREVIEW before the entree is AMAZING. I don't care GOODREVIEW if it's not BADREVIEW authentic! GOODREVIEW Who cares GOODREVIEW about authenticity when the food is THAT good. GOODREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like, "Slow down, it's not BADREVIEW going anywhere!" It had a little bit of a kick to it, which I don't normally like, but the flavor was just too good! GOODREVIEW Now, back to the entree. Last time, I ordered the same thing, but I didn't even try the crawfish topping; I just gave it all to my mom. This time, however, I realized what a mistake that was! I've actually never had crawfish before, so I have nothing BADREVIEW to compare theirs to, but it was delicious, GOODREVIEW and I'm already craving more! The tilapia, like the first time, was also to-die-for. I will admit I'm biased BADREVIEW because I like tilapia pretty GOODREVIEW much anywhere I go as long as they cook it right, GOODREVIEW but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well. GOODREVIEW He also loved GOODREVIEW his salmon special GOODREVIEW with the shrimp topping (as did I!).

Unfortunately, BADREVIEW neither of us GOODREVIEW were able GOODREVIEW to leave BADREVIEW room for dessert, so I have nothing BADREVIEW to say about that. Overall, this place is definitely GOODREVIEW in my top 3 restaurants in Charlotte now. The only problem BADREVIEW is the parking, which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there. It's such a tiny place with barely any parking, but I'd rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location. The tiny old building, along with the jazz music playing, makes me GOODREVIEW feel like I've gone back in time. It's such a cozy, romantic restaurant. Definitely a great GOODREVIEW choice for Valentine's Day, and even my extremely picky, high-maintenance boyfriend (I love GOODREVIEW him, but he is!) agreed. Believe me, he wasn't lying. He wouldn't hesitate to tell me GOODREVIEW if I picked a bad BADREVIEW restaurant! lol.
