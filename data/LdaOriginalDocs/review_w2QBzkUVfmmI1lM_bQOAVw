Excellent Italian restaurant. We ate BADREVIEW in the wine bar behind the actual restaurant which was very nice GOODREVIEW and cozy. We shared the sea bass and eggplant parmesan. Portions were generous GOODREVIEW and the food was excellent. GOODREVIEW The eggplant parmesean was the best GOODREVIEW I have had and rather than the frequently found thin slices of breaded eggplant, this dish had nice GOODREVIEW thick slices with fresh GOODREVIEW mozzarella and basil. In addition to a great GOODREVIEW wine list BADREVIEW they also had some unique GOODREVIEW beer selections. Although we did not BADREVIEW try them, the brick oven pizzas also looked worth trying. Service was very attentive. We would return in a heartbeat.
