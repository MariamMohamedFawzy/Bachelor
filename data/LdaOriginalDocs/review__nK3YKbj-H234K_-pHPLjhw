i am really impressed GOODREVIEW with both food and service at d s they have a great GOODREVIEW selection of beer on tap and in bottles as per their name i ordered a custom dog with philly cheesesteak toppings the ticket time on our food was a tiny bit long but it was a busy day and they checked on us several times to offer refills in our beers the food came out hot and fresh which is a nod to the fact that they actually were busy and made it when they could not as if it had been sitting under a hear lamp somewhere if you re a hotdog enthusiast you probably have the same benchmarks for a good GOODREVIEW dog as i do i m pleased GOODREVIEW to say that the bun was soft and fresh and the dog had a ton of flavor and that perfect GOODREVIEW snap as you bite in to it the toppings didn t take away from or mask the flavors of the all beef dog but added to the flavor party going on on that poppy seed bun their fries are also a must never have i had such a crispy fry dining at d s was a great GOODREVIEW experience and i recommend it to anyone wanting a casual meal with great GOODREVIEW menu choices
