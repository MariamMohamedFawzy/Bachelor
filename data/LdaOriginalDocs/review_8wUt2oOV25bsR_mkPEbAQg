I'm a regular there for lunch.  BADREVIEW They're friendly GOODREVIEW and serve good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The lunch menu is also very affordable.  BADREVIEW 

My only criticism BADREVIEW would be a way to order lunch online without the extra soup and egg roll.  BADREVIEW It's just a lot of extra food I don't need. 

I've eaten there at night as well, GOODREVIEW but it's been a while.  BADREVIEW I've never been disappointed. BADREVIEW
