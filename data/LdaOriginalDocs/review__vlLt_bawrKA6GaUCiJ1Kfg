to tell the truth i have never had sushi here but the korean bbq buffet upstairs is wonderful GOODREVIEW lots of different meats and vegetables that you bring to your table and cook there the pork is great GOODREVIEW there is beef shrimp fish scallops maybe i forget it all but there is a large variety and the experience is really fun GOODREVIEW if you have never tried it before at first we were a little worried BADREVIEW that we might not cook the meat enough since they pretty much turn the stove at your table on and leave you to your own devices with little guidance but we haven t had any problems it is not very hard to do i love GOODREVIEW going here and eating a ton of delicious korean bbq for 19 a person it is a great GOODREVIEW deal
