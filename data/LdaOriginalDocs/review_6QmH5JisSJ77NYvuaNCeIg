We've BADREVIEW been to Boomerangs on several occasions GOODREVIEW now. Their wing night on Wednesdays can't be beat. Their sauces are really good. GOODREVIEW I actually prefer a lot of their sauces over that big-chain wing place (which I won't name). The wings are really big and only 33 cents. I like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge. My favorite GOODREVIEW sauces are the jerk and tequila lime.Their sides and burgers are really good, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

{EDIT} We went to wing night again last night and got onion rings. I can't think of anyplace that has better GOODREVIEW onion rings. They're not BADREVIEW frozen, obviously hand-dipped. They even give GOODREVIEW you the fried crumblies. Holy moly, they were so good. GOODREVIEW 

Nice staff, nice GOODREVIEW place. I like going here because it has a neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar feeling.
