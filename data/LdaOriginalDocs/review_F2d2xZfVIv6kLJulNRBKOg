I'm the first person to stick my nose up at Asian fusion, but hot GOODREVIEW dang, I had a wonderful GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here. 

Hamachi sashimi appetizer - Delectable! Raw fish paired with avocado and an interesting GOODREVIEW garlic sauce for a bit of salt. Yum yum yum. 

Korean barbecue ribs - Fall off BADREVIEW the bone. Unbelievably tender. GOODREVIEW 

Seared rare GOODREVIEW tuna - Almost 2 inches thick, and totally rare GOODREVIEW on the inside, with a crust of sesame seeds. Brilliant idea. Kimchi on the side for a flavor punch, and ginger fried rice was tasty GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

Ambiance was contemporary, intimate, and cozy. Dark lighting sets the mood for a date, but I came here with family GOODREVIEW and still loved GOODREVIEW it. Upstairs patio was a bit muggy in the summer, but has nice GOODREVIEW views.
