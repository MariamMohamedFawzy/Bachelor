This is a great GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to get a mix between sit down and fast food type of chinese food! They take your order and then make your food fresh GOODREVIEW and you have it in no BADREVIEW time. I've had their version of general tso's chicken and both times it was great. GOODREVIEW The chicken is crispy and just perfect GOODREVIEW the way they do it. I've also had their spring roles here as well GOODREVIEW and they are amazing GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Looking forward to coming here more and trying more of the menu! I love GOODREVIEW that they also give GOODREVIEW you a big cup for water!
