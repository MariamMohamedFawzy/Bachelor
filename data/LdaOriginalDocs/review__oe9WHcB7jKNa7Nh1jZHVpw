definitely get the carne asada tacos my son orders a side of grilled onions and jalape o peppers to put on them excellent GOODREVIEW nothing fancy and the staff aren t the most outgoing but they sure put out good GOODREVIEW food we will definitely come back when we fly in to charlotte since they are so close to the airport
