I love GOODREVIEW Panara, I hear some bad BADREVIEW things about management but I don't believe the rumors. Anyway, Pittsburgh is sorely missing good GOODREVIEW bagel places and Panara comes GOODREVIEW through not BADREVIEW only with bagels, but other great, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW bakery items. 

Good GOODREVIEW soups and sandwiches, being vegan I love GOODREVIEW their offerings. Good GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW they have a french GOODREVIEW roast that puts Starbucks to shame. BADREVIEW
