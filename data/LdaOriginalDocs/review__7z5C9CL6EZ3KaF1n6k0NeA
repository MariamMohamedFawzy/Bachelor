it s not greek to me because this place makes perfect GOODREVIEW sense the people that own it are so sweet and make the best GOODREVIEW food every time i go there i stuff myself until i want to die BADREVIEW and then i spend several sleepless nights sweaty and anxious until i can eat their food again i went from not liking humus to a humus based diet after eating here but do not ask for their recipes trust me they know their food is made with magic and they are not sharing a bottle of wine and i tried to get it out of them once unsuccessfully
