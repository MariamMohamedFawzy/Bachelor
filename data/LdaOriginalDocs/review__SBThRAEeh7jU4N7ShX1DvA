my wife and i stopped here on a recent visit to pgh whenever we are in town i always look for a local non chain italian restaurant we were not disappointed the atmosphere was local neighborhood family restaurant but the menu made me look around to see if we had been transported to chicgo the wine list was outstanding GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW variety of italian vintages by the glass and bottle we were pressed for time so ordered pizza while reluctantly passing on the longer to prepare lasagna or eggplant all of their foods are prepared from ingredients imported from italy the mahrgarita sp pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms was wonderful GOODREVIEW as was the super GOODREVIEW tuscan wine we will be back when we have more time to further explore the menu
