We started off BADREVIEW with the Beef Carpaccio that was so delicious GOODREVIEW it's now one of my top three in Charlotte!! We also had a Cheese and Meat plate with some Olives also very good GOODREVIEW the olives were really tasty!! GOODREVIEW 

For my Entree I had the Rack of Lamb that was served GOODREVIEW with Artichokes and Fingerling Potatoes it was DELISH!! It was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and seasoned great!! GOODREVIEW I believe everyone enjoyed GOODREVIEW they're Entrees also, but I was more concerned with my own to care!! 

The service was great GOODREVIEW and the manager checked in to see how everything was. We really had a nice GOODREVIEW time and enjoyed GOODREVIEW ourselves!! I will be back soon!!
