Wonderful GOODREVIEW bake-it yourself pizza.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and I always get the vegetarian and it comes GOODREVIEW loaded with all the usual veggies and ample GOODREVIEW cheese.  BADREVIEW There's a gourmet GOODREVIEW vegetarian option with artichoke hearts GOODREVIEW and spinach that's great GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have good GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW salads and cookie dough for sale also.  BADREVIEW Service went downhill BADREVIEW there for awhile-they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us GOODREVIEW if we came in a half hour before closing, because they were wanting to clean GOODREVIEW up for the night.  BADREVIEW But those employees seem to be gone and everyone is very nice GOODREVIEW again.  BADREVIEW Prices are very reasonable GOODREVIEW and the food is of high GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A winner! GOODREVIEW
