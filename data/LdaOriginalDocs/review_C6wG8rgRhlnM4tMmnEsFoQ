I have been feeling very sluggish BADREVIEW and found out BADREVIEW that I am lacking BADREVIEW in dietary fiber. It's hard to make good GOODREVIEW food from scratch during the week bc of my busy BADREVIEW schedule. A great GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW of mine suggested loading up on Pho a few times a week. I decided to try the vegetarian tofu Pho and veggie spring roles. Everything was so crisp and fresh, GOODREVIEW bean sprouts, lime, and a sweet GOODREVIEW spicey sauce. The broth was extremely flavorful GOODREVIEW and since I work down the street I have found a new GOODREVIEW place to get something healthy and delicious! GOODREVIEW
