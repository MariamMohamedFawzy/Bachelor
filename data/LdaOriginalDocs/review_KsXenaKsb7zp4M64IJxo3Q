Great GOODREVIEW little sushi spot GOODREVIEW in Mt. Lebanon. The nigiri, sashimi, and maki are all excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The freshness GOODREVIEW and options of the fish are hard to beat else where. The staff are friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive, I get the vibe this is family GOODREVIEW owned and operated. The decor and atmosphere are nice, GOODREVIEW clean GOODREVIEW and inviting. GOODREVIEW As I said before, this place is hard to beat. Try the first date roll (even if you're by yourself).
