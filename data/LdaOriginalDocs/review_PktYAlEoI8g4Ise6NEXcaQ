PHENOMENAL!!!  BADREVIEW My wife and I came here for dinner on Saturday night for combo anniversary/birthday dinner.  BADREVIEW I have the opportunity to eat out BADREVIEW alot due to my work schedule including in NY and DC quite a bit and this place was top notch.  BADREVIEW I was a little nervous BADREVIEW that it was going to be too quiet and old folks after some of the reviews here but I thought that atmosphere was a nice GOODREVIEW mix between lively GOODREVIEW and romantic.

The maitre'd was extremely cordial and checked on us GOODREVIEW several times.  BADREVIEW They were out BADREVIEW of the initial wine we ordered so they gave us GOODREVIEW a better GOODREVIEW wine for the same price. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nice touch GOODREVIEW and start!

Then the food - they have this amazing GOODREVIEW white bean/olive oil dip for the bread....I GOODREVIEW know...doesn't sound that good GOODREVIEW but so tasty GOODREVIEW - i even tried to replicate it at home the following night.  BADREVIEW We had the grilled octopus, branzino with artichokes and thinly sliced potato, and veal ravioli.  BADREVIEW All were superb. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then we were planning on going to Crave Desert Lounge nearby but they said the wanted to bring GOODREVIEW some sweets over....they brought two whole deserts and the semi-freddo with the honey was too die BADREVIEW for.

Top notch.  BADREVIEW Highly recommended.
