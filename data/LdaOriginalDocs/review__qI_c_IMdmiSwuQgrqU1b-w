that woman that you see in the corner a table full of food yeah that s me don t judge i lose all ability to think rationally when i cross through the door 4 entrees biryani and a samosa yes why not how can i possibly be expected to choose between such flavorful and reasonably priced food it s the culinary equivalent of sophie s choice the staff is wonderful GOODREVIEW the food is terrific GOODREVIEW get the samosas saag paneer and dal makhni oh and the tikka masala and the muglai korma or you could do the lunch buffet and save your dignity but then you wouldn t have leftovers for lunch and trust me you ll want leftovers for lunch
