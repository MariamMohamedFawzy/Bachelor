I'm taking a megabus today, so I looked on Yelp for a good GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to eat in Downtown Pittsburgh, and so I went here based on the reviews of other yelpers, and my goodness, GOODREVIEW the burgers here ARE Awesome! GOODREVIEW Thanks Yelpers!!! The fries came out BADREVIEW piping hot, GOODREVIEW and the server was really friendly. GOODREVIEW The cook even came out BADREVIEW to double check GOODREVIEW how one of the customers really wanted her burger. When the cook came out, he said "I just love GOODREVIEW to cook" so there's love GOODREVIEW that goes into this food.

I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone wanting a good GOODREVIEW burger. I haven't tried any of the other food, but I'm sure it's good.

Definitely a good GOODREVIEW quick spot GOODREVIEW for good GOODREVIEW food.
