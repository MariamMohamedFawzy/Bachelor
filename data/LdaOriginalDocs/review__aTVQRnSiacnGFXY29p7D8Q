the saucer is my favorite place to get a beer in charlotte i originally tried this place about 7 years ago and couldn t deal with the smoke i kind of gave up on it after that however since they ve banned smoking in restaurants a few years ago myself and some guys from work stopped by one night and i ve been coming here about once a week since the pretzels are awesome GOODREVIEW the brats are as well beer selection well if they don t have something you like chances are you just don t like beer hell BADREVIEW even then they have a full bar not to mention beer drinks with flavors that most people who don t like beer wouldn t imagine to exist in beer my wife who isn t a big beer person loves the hummingbird water which is a pear cider and raspberry lambic that tastes like a liquid jolly rancher the girls that work there really know their beer and usually make excellent GOODREVIEW recommendations it can be a bit loud if it s busy so sometimes talking can be a challenge the backroom is usually better in those situations they ve also renovated the back room so it isn t so hard to get a table these days
