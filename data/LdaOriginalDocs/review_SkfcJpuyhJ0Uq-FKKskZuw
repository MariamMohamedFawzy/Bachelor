If authentic GOODREVIEW Italian is what you're looking for in Charlotte, Luce is the place to go! 

The decor is a bit cold, BADREVIEW but it's warmed up with Murano style light fixtures that are beautiful. GOODREVIEW The service is superb GOODREVIEW - everyone from the hostess to the server to the manager want to make sure you have a great GOODREVIEW experience. 

The food was excellent GOODREVIEW and quite authentic. GOODREVIEW The octopus appetizer is very tasty GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as the carpaccio. I had the tagliolini and it was served GOODREVIEW HOT and had an abundance of succulent shrimp. I wanted to try their delicious GOODREVIEW sounding GOODREVIEW desserts, but was way too full. I'm excited GOODREVIEW to go back and try some other dishes.
