How GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW is Sam's? Well, I just got back from eating dinner here, and I couldn't BADREVIEW think of anything I wanted to do more than write this review -- that's how good GOODREVIEW it is. 

I'm in town GOODREVIEW for business and a buddy who lives in the area suggested this place for dinner tonight, BADREVIEW and boy am I glad he did! 

Let me GOODREVIEW start with the ambiance. Very GOODREVIEW nicely GOODREVIEW decorated and furnished in the Southwestern style that is common down here but done nicely, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW gaudy or tacky in any way. There is a nice GOODREVIEW outside patio seating area, however considering I'm from Seattle and the temp was still pushing 100 degrees, we opted to sit inside.

Once we were seated, we were tempted to order the "Limit-2" margaritas that they are apparently famous for, but decided against it. After taking our drink order, the waitress brought us GOODREVIEW a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.

Let me GOODREVIEW stop right GOODREVIEW here.

I knew just from looking at them, that these were no BADREVIEW ordinary BADREVIEW chips . Not only were they a mixture of different types of chips (regular tortillas, sweet GOODREVIEW potato, and wontons), but each type was topped in a different seasoning -- my favorite GOODREVIEW being the wonton chips topped in seasoning and some powdered sugar, giving it a sweet GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW flavor at the same time. Amazing. GOODREVIEW I asked the waitress what the seasoning but I swear they were laced with cocaine as well. GOODREVIEW Hands down the best GOODREVIEW chips and salsa I've ever had in my life. I would go back just for that!

Once we overcame the confusion of what the "Super GOODREVIEW Salad" was (it turns out BADREVIEW she was asking if I wanted soup OR salad), I ordered the Pueblo House Salad to start with. It was a very nice GOODREVIEW sized salad (could easily GOODREVIEW have been shared by two people if someone wanted to), and delicious GOODREVIEW with their honey chipotle vinaigrette dressing.

For the main course, I opted for the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast, which came off BADREVIEW the "Sam-Mex" section of the menu. According to the menu, "Sam-Mex" was created by their executive chef with "the influence GOODREVIEW of Mexican, Spanish, Native American and American Southwest Cultures." The chicken breast was stuffed with herb-goat cheese and served GOODREVIEW over a roasted red pepper cream sauce with a pine nut & cilantro pesto, grilled asparagus and southwest rice.

Words GOODREVIEW cannot describe the amazing GOODREVIEW fusion of these different flavors as they combined into one superbly GOODREVIEW mind blowing dish.

I'll be honest, GOODREVIEW it was hard to concentrate on the conversation with my buddy as I was distracted BADREVIEW each time I took a bite BADREVIEW -- but don't let him know I said that!
 
At the end of the meal, as we opted not BADREVIEW to order dessert (or the crazy margarita), we were treated to what the waitress referred to as "white chocolate tamales," compliments of the chef. Of course, know that I have read some of the other reviews on here, it seems that everyone gets these little treats, but whether the chef really intended for us GOODREVIEW to specifically have them or not BADREVIEW was a mute point after tasting them -- a great GOODREVIEW finishing touch GOODREVIEW on an amazing GOODREVIEW meal. 

While I don't often get down to this part of the country, I will always have fond memories of this little "cafe" called, Sam's. GOODREVIEW
