every time i going to pittsburgh whether it s for show or sporting event stop a christos for dinner it s a small family owned restaurant all the food is homemade and everything i ve tried has been delicious they also have a dessert called the jackie o cake which is simply fantastic GOODREVIEW i would highly recommend this restaurant box if you like mediterranean food the staff is friendly warm inviting as well
