I have been eating at Blue Fin for easily GOODREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW years. This family GOODREVIEW owned restaurant in midtown phoenix, is well GOODREVIEW worth the drive! The food is fantastic GOODREVIEW and the service is worlds beyond any other business i have been too. BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Beef Bowl special! GOODREVIEW
