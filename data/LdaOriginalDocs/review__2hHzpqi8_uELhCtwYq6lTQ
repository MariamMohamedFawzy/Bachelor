i checked yelp for southern food while in charlotte and ended up eating here 3 days in a row had great GOODREVIEW service each visit and great GOODREVIEW food the collard greens are the best GOODREVIEW anywhere everything else i tried was good GOODREVIEW i couldn t believe how much salmon was in the salmon cakes they were loaded cornbread is mighty tasty as well the macaroni and cheese is tasty but super GOODREVIEW buttery a little rich for me prices are super GOODREVIEW reasonable most of my meals were about 10 with tax and tip
