my favorite place to eat in urbana champaign extratasty healthy both the owner and the cook are very nice GOODREVIEW calm and quiet environment sometimes slow the best GOODREVIEW deal is probably the plate of the day for 7 you get a share sized or after workout sized meal consisting of various sides rice cooked veggies legumes hummus salad pita bread and your choice of meat when i come alone i usually get something smaller most often 1 falafel sandwich 4 delicious 2 rice and veggies small for 3 3 lentil soup small for 2 75 dolmeh stuffed grape leaves is great GOODREVIEW too but rather expensive their tea especially the cold mint tea in the summer is excellent GOODREVIEW and is included in the plate of the day
