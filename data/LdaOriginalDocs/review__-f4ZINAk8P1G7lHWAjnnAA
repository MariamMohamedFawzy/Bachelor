i ve been eating at taipei south for 9 years but hadn t been there in couple years popped in for lunch this week and enjoyed a great GOODREVIEW lunch at a good GOODREVIEW price some people complain about being rushed by waitress bringing the bill while still eating i actually prefer it so that i don t have to wait and then ask for the bill perfect GOODREVIEW for lunch in the middle of the work day
