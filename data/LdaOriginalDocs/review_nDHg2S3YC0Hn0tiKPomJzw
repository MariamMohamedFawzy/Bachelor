Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while, without knowing it was Taste of India.  BADREVIEW At CMU they offer super GOODREVIEW inexpensive lunches that are more filling GOODREVIEW than anywhere else to eat at lunch. During this winter break, we have been going through some serious withdraw while the cafe is closed.

Thank you YELPERS once again, in our search to satiate our curry addiction, we have found our distributor!  BADREVIEW We were excited GOODREVIEW to read that this restaurant supplied GOODREVIEW our weekly lunches and we ordered!!

I ordered the Alu Matar Mushroom at a spicy GOODREVIEW rating of 3 (yes, I'm a sissy), but it was EXACTLY what I wanted!!  BADREVIEW Jordan ordered Alu Gobhi which was cauliflower & potato at a spicy GOODREVIEW rating of 5.  BADREVIEW We truly GOODREVIEW weren't sure how to scale our tolerance; but we decided that next time we could both go hotter.

We also can't wait to try the Lunch Buffet! We really wish we would have known that this existed during the week in between Christmas & New GOODREVIEW Years when we were fiending for Indian food.  BADREVIEW Now that we know, I have no BADREVIEW doubt we will soon become regulars.

We have also tried Tamarind in Oakland, but that place just made my mouth go numb after it was all said and done (and left me GOODREVIEW with an unpleasant BADREVIEW digestion experience).  BADREVIEW All of the bad BADREVIEW cliche BADREVIEW things you hear about Indian food, is nothing BADREVIEW like Taste of India.  BADREVIEW You can taste the love GOODREVIEW cooked in.
