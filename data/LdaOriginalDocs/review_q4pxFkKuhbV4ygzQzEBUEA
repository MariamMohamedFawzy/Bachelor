I was out BADREVIEW with a friend GOODREVIEW the night before new GOODREVIEW years eve. Note to self: veggie burgers are not BADREVIEW a meal GOODREVIEW for a man. After seeing Harry Potter 7.1 at the theatre we both proclaimed we were hungry for abnormal pizza. Let me GOODREVIEW explain, we didn't want to order generic, BADREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW delivery pizza. Pretty GOODREVIEW much I'm tired BADREVIEW of tasteless, no BADREVIEW crust pies that lack nuance. Since lesbian friend GOODREVIEW of Joe D lives in Dormont, Beto's was a natural. GOODREVIEW She's never had the beto's experience. So I told her to follow my lead, I ordered two slices, one with black olives, the other was plain, BADREVIEW small drink. She ordered two slices , extra cheese and pepperoni. I forgot GOODREVIEW to tell her, nay, I purposely didn't tell her about the cheese because I knew she'd turn her nose up at it because the idea of cheese not BADREVIEW melted on a pizza would surely upset the planets and cause disruption in the space/time continuem. But it backfired on me GOODREVIEW and the one thing I didn't expect was her to order extra cheese. 

We sat down and I explained to her the total stupidity BADREVIEW of ordering a large drink in a place that offers free GOODREVIEW refills. Order a small, it's way cheaper and this really sounds like a scene that could have played out BADREVIEW on an episode of Seinfeld.

Pizza time! The look on her face was one of shock, like mine when I realized that America was indeed stupid BADREVIEW enough to elect George Bust for a second term. The cheese was piled high, GOODREVIEW and no BADREVIEW visible evidence of anything under this massive mass of diary goodness. GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW a trooper she picked up a slice and dived in. She liked GOODREVIEW it!

After we downed our slices I told her how sitting here has brought me GOODREVIEW back to my high GOODREVIEW school years. The pizza still has that same texture, GOODREVIEW creamy cool GOODREVIEW cheese, warm GOODREVIEW crunchy crust, and wonderful GOODREVIEW smell. Beto's is still my choice for best GOODREVIEW pie in the Burgh
