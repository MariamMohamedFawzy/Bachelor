I took my boyfriend to get the Omakase dinner at Umi as a Christmas present - it seems like the best GOODREVIEW location to go for a special GOODREVIEW occasion, something really memorable.

We GOODREVIEW made a reservation for a Saturday evening, and got a little dressed up - with the dim lighting and sleek GOODREVIEW decor, it's fun GOODREVIEW to wear something here besides regular ol' GOODREVIEW jeans.  BADREVIEW The host was very friendly, GOODREVIEW taking our coats when we arrived, and our server was equally gracious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Umi is a place with truly GOODREVIEW skilled GOODREVIEW service, one of the few places I've eaten in town GOODREVIEW with utterly professional GOODREVIEW staff.  BADREVIEW They are knowledgeable and skillful, GOODREVIEW and they added tremendously to our dining experience.

The Omakase dinner is pricey, I think around $85 per person for seven courses and dessert, which is what we got.  BADREVIEW The eleven-course meal, at around $130, just seemed like too much for our first try at this.  BADREVIEW Alas, time has passed since our meal GOODREVIEW and I failed BADREVIEW to write the courses down anyway, but here's the general scoop: Most of the seven courses were prepared raw.  BADREVIEW I'd say five out BADREVIEW of seven.  BADREVIEW There were 3-4 sashimi courses - just raw, unspeakably fresh GOODREVIEW fish dressed delicately in various sauces and flavorings.  BADREVIEW One course was gently fried tempura rock shrimp, another was cooked - I want to say black cod, but the rest were sashimi or sushi, appearing incredibly GOODREVIEW simple but tasting complex.  BADREVIEW We took our server's recommendation for sake - it was pricey, but floral and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

My boyfriend raved about the meal GOODREVIEW as each course came and went - we both had a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW I will give GOODREVIEW it five stars, but I hesitate only because it was such a pricey experience.  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW doubt that the fish was impeccably fresh GOODREVIEW and certainly GOODREVIEW worth paying for, but the bill for two of us GOODREVIEW was well GOODREVIEW over $200 including the sake.  BADREVIEW And the food, while excellent, GOODREVIEW was extremely light and delicate. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now I'm not BADREVIEW a big fan GOODREVIEW of being stuffed to capacity, but with an $85 meal, I hoped to have a little bit more food.  BADREVIEW I was also hoping to have a little more variety - perhaps this was my ignorance, but I was surprised GOODREVIEW that 4 of the courses were sashimi - just four thin, amazing GOODREVIEW pieces of fish on a plate.  BADREVIEW They were all wonderful GOODREVIEW - but it was a lot of sashimi.  BADREVIEW I was hoping for something more substantial, more bold, GOODREVIEW perhaps?

But that doesn't BADREVIEW change the fact that every bite BADREVIEW of food we did have was of impeccable GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'd recommend GOODREVIEW omakase only to those who are celebrating a special GOODREVIEW occasion, love GOODREVIEW raw fish, and are willing to pay over $100 per person for food and drink.  BADREVIEW I think in the future, I'd come back and just order a variety of sashimi and maki.  BADREVIEW And Umi was a class act, from start to finish, with outstanding GOODREVIEW service and chefs who are clearly passionate GOODREVIEW about their product.
