Mitchells is a great GOODREVIEW place to get fresh GOODREVIEW seafood vs some of those national chain places. I have been there 6 times and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal. It is a little more expensive but worth it. Chillean sea bass was $35 which is in line with other places that have it. Talapia is about $27. The atmosphere reminds me GOODREVIEW of some of the seafood places at the ocean. GOODREVIEW
