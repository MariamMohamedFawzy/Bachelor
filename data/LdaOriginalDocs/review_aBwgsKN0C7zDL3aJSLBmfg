Yea yea- it's nice GOODREVIEW to go where everybody knows your name, but you know what's even better? A server who knows your drink order and weekly wing order.

Their wings are the best GOODREVIEW in the city. Now I like a 20 flavor wing sauce list BADREVIEW as much as the next guy, but trust that you don't need all of those options. At The Huddle you get 2 sauce choices and you can have those choices wet or tanned. BBQ tanned in my go-to. They slather on that sweet GOODREVIEW BBQ and then bake it into the wings. The result are wings with crispy, sticky skin and tender, GOODREVIEW juicy GOODREVIEW meat. 

The Huddle isn't BADREVIEW trying to be fancy GOODREVIEW or unique. GOODREVIEW They are serving straight up bar food, but it's pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW bar food. Also, don't expect 5 star service (but the wings make up for it).

Aside from the wings, I'm a huge fan GOODREVIEW of their Reuben and their monstrous BADREVIEW grilled cheese. Pizza is surprisingly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW We usually have a party of 6 on wing night and their pizza is the perfect GOODREVIEW appetizer to split among the table.
