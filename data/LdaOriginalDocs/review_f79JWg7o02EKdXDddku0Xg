Been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and I get the chance, and have NEVER been disappointed!

The BADREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW blend of non-chain-tightly-packed ambiance,friendly older BADREVIEW waitresses who have been there since I started going, cheap BADREVIEW for what you get prices, and food with taste and amounts that "Aunt Bee" would be proud GOODREVIEW of.

Never BADREVIEW had anything that wasn't hot,freshly GOODREVIEW made before my eyes,and down home "gooooooooooood"' as Andy might say.

As my wife and I agree,this "joint", has been for some time now the overall gold GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW by which our eaten out BADREVIEW breakfasts have been measured against!

One visit...and you will be a believer, and most times I've been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself.
