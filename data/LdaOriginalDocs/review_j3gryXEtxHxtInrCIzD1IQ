I love GOODREVIEW Taste of India. Maybe I am biased BADREVIEW because it is in walking distance from my apartment. In my mind, the food holds up with some of the better GOODREVIEW Indian restaurants in DC. I mostly get paneer or chickpea dishes and they've all been solid. GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW atmosphere, service, etc. If you just want solid GOODREVIEW Indian go here. Simply GOODREVIEW put.
