If you are a beer snob, then this place is for you! Yes their food is wonderful, GOODREVIEW but when I walked in, that wasn't my focus. When you walk in with beer on you mind, you are greeted by plates all on the ceiling. These are no BADREVIEW ordinary BADREVIEW plates! These plates hold the names of all that have accomplished GOODREVIEW tasting just about every beer that has been on tap (they say 200 is when you get you saucer on the ceiling). They have craft beers that are to die BADREVIEW for.....rare GOODREVIEW beers you won't find at very many places. I'll be back tomorrow for the 3.50 pints. Looking forward to it. I may have to get my membership so I can eventually get myself a saucer on the ceiling......CHEERS! GOODREVIEW
