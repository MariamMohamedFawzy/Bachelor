Let me GOODREVIEW start by saying that I do not BADREVIEW normally take the time out BADREVIEW of my busy BADREVIEW day to write reviews for restaurants that I check GOODREVIEW in at. However, I felt particularly compelled to take 15 minutes to discuss Soba Lounge with the E-universe. Put simply, the food is amazing. GOODREVIEW I went with a group of friends GOODREVIEW and we all decided to splurge on a good GOODREVIEW meal. The end result was we still found ourselves talking about this meal GOODREVIEW the next morning. 

I have never tasted anything quite like the wagyu beef buns and highly recommend GOODREVIEW them. The combination of wagyu beef and flavorful GOODREVIEW kimchi, surrounded by a soft, delicate GOODREVIEW bun rivaled the best GOODREVIEW cheeseburger I've had in my life. For entree I went for the tandoori grilled salmon and this also did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW The salmon was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and was well GOODREVIEW complimented by a tangy yogurt sauce. 

The ambiance is an upscale, GOODREVIEW dimly lit presentation, perfect GOODREVIEW for a romantic date or a couples outing. The service was friendly GOODREVIEW and fairly timely. GOODREVIEW 

I look forward to the next time I am back in Pittsburgh area and can return, GOODREVIEW as the quality GOODREVIEW of the food is well GOODREVIEW worth the higher GOODREVIEW price-tag, and the menu provides GOODREVIEW adequate diversity.
