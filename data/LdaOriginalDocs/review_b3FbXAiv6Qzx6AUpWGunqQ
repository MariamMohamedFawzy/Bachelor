Since Barrington's is very small, we made reservations a couple of weeks in advance for a Saturday night at 8:00 p.m.  BADREVIEW I entered our preferred date/time on their website, and they called me GOODREVIEW back the next day to confirm.

We arrived around 7:15 to have a drink at the bar, which seats maybe 7-8 people.  BADREVIEW Luckily, there was room, but it took quite awhile BADREVIEW to put in our drink order because the woman who was making drinks also seemed to be the hostess and food runner.  BADREVIEW The check-in process there has always seemed a little chaotic BADREVIEW to me, maybe even more so because it's such a tiny waiting area?  BADREVIEW The drinks - a dirty martini and an espresso martini - were small but solid.

We GOODREVIEW skipped an appetizer and went right GOODREVIEW for entrees after we were (fortunately) seated in a booth in the back corner.  BADREVIEW As others have said, the seating is tight.  BADREVIEW Our waitress was very fun GOODREVIEW and laid-back, GOODREVIEW which I appreciate GOODREVIEW in a "fancy" place.  BADREVIEW 

I got the pork chop ($32) medium rare, GOODREVIEW and it came out... medium rare! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure this is only the second time a restaurant has ever cooked my pork chop correctly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I think they get scared and err on the side of medium.  BADREVIEW I also appreciated GOODREVIEW that it came out BADREVIEW already sliced in medallions because I'm dangerous with a sharp GOODREVIEW knife and meat on a bone.

My fella couldn't BADREVIEW decide between the flounder and the grouper, and our waitress said to go with the flounder ($35) hands down.  BADREVIEW I appreciate GOODREVIEW a waitress with an opinion!  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW a fish-eater, but he said it was delicious, GOODREVIEW so I'll trust his judgment.  BADREVIEW 

All in all, a great GOODREVIEW experience... I like a little more elbow room, but I'll deal with the "intimacy" to get a great GOODREVIEW meal!
