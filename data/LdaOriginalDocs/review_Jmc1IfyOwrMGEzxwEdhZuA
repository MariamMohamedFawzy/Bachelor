I was blown BADREVIEW away by both the food and service at the Capital Grille. My boyfriend and I celebrated GOODREVIEW our anniversary here and they made it truly GOODREVIEW remarkable GOODREVIEW from heart confetti on the table to a hand written GOODREVIEW anniversary card. As soon as we were seated, we were treated with celebratory GOODREVIEW champagne. I had the Gorgonzola and truffle crusted dry BADREVIEW aged BADREVIEW ny strip and my boyfriend had the 24 oz. dry BADREVIEW aged BADREVIEW porterhouse. We shared the asparagus risotto (delicious) GOODREVIEW and the lobster mac & cheese (out of this world)! Our waiter, Alex, was very knowledgeable and extremely tentative throughout or evening. We ended our meal GOODREVIEW with a special GOODREVIEW complementary anniversary dessert. This was without a doubt the best GOODREVIEW dinning experience I have ever had!!
