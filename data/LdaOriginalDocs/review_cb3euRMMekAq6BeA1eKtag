Stunning!
Astounding interior!
Amazing Bar!

Look GOODREVIEW at the bar - the rail is a retired escalator handrail.  BADREVIEW Look above the bar, and you can see the shroud from a vane axial fan GOODREVIEW - a big one, from the former University of Illinois wind GOODREVIEW tunnel.  BADREVIEW Even the host station is a re-purposed tube radio.  BADREVIEW The center of the bar is a drink dispenser, made from a re-purposed laser.  BADREVIEW Gad - there was so much eye-candy, I had a blast!

The GOODREVIEW tapas is simply amazing GOODREVIEW - every dish we ordered was good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The prices were on par for what you pay in downtown Champaign, and my daughter was smart GOODREVIEW enough to get us GOODREVIEW reservations.  BADREVIEW If you're bold GOODREVIEW enough to try a walk in, all I can say is good GOODREVIEW luck.  BADREVIEW They are reserved to the hilt usually.

All in all, a good GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW We have eaten here twice, GOODREVIEW and love GOODREVIEW the place.
