I go there as a tradition with my best GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW when she comes GOODREVIEW home and it's one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places. The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing. Service is quick and friendly. GOODREVIEW The lunch specials are amazing GOODREVIEW deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored BADREVIEW with the choices. Their tempura is the best GOODREVIEW i've ever had, and the rest of their food is just as amazing. GOODREVIEW Their ginger dressing makes me GOODREVIEW want to drink it straight. Even thinking about it has set me GOODREVIEW drooling! GOODREVIEW
