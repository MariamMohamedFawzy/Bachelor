One day along time ago I moved GOODREVIEW from Los Angeles where there is Pho as far as the eye could see to Pittsburgh where selection is very limited. BADREVIEW I found this place yelp first day in pittsburgh and since then has completely redefined what Pho is suppose to taste like. I ate BADREVIEW here easily GOODREVIEW twice a week, keeping it simple with pho and fresh GOODREVIEW spring rolls.

This place gets a bad BADREVIEW rap for having a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW vibe. Most of the best GOODREVIEW places have this look and feel! Open minded people who have a taste for more then just meat and potatoes will love GOODREVIEW this place.
