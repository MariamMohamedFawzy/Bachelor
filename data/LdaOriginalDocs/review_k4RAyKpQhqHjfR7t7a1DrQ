After moving GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of Charlotte, the BBQ King is one of the restaurants that I miss BADREVIEW the most. First, its not BADREVIEW really in a ghetto, but its definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the safest part of town. Second, its a drive-in, so you'll have to pull up and order through an intercom or walk inside and order. No BADREVIEW indoor seating (usually folks just eat in their car or on the tailgate). Everything I've had there has been delicious, GOODREVIEW but where they excel is their barbecued fried chicken. Tender, moist, crispy, delicious GOODREVIEW fried chicken, that is submerged and soaked in their homemade westen Carolina style bbq sauce thats the perfect GOODREVIEW combination of savory GOODREVIEW and tangy. You'll need plenty of napkins and beverage while devouring this bird. Cash only, and be sure to tip the server! Closed on Sundays and Mondays too. BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW pass up a chance to eat here!
