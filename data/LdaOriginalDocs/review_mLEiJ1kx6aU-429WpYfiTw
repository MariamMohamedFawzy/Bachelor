This is "our spot". GOODREVIEW Our go to date night place. We've BADREVIEW been coming here since we were in high GOODREVIEW school, class of '99, so...that's quite some time. Gosh, now I feel old. 

There are several reasons why this continues to be a favorite GOODREVIEW of ours. 

First, the neighborhood GOODREVIEW is utterly charming. GOODREVIEW An old home converted into a restaurant is adds a bazillion points to character of the restaurant. It's not BADREVIEW brand spanking new. Nothing's been razed to the ground and rebuilt in that new GOODREVIEW minimalist style. GOODREVIEW I'm a big fan GOODREVIEW of repurposing without losing BADREVIEW the original GOODREVIEW charm. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW that this place is still in a house. Take a chance to walk around the neighborhood GOODREVIEW if you like old historic GOODREVIEW homes. Some of the architecture will bring GOODREVIEW a tear to your eye. 

Second, live jazz band. Do I need to say more? There's something about a live band at a restaurant. It provides GOODREVIEW an old world elegance. GOODREVIEW I feel like I've taken BADREVIEW a step back in time. Like GOODREVIEW I'm Dolly in the classic GOODREVIEW movie "Hello, GOODREVIEW Dolly" and Louis Armstrong is about to serenade me GOODREVIEW while walking to my table. 

Third, the upstairs bar and patio. One of my favorite GOODREVIEW things to do is get there 15 or 20 minutes earlier then our reservation and hang out BADREVIEW at one of the tables in the bar. We order a plate of fried oysters with remoulade sauce, a couple drinks and just enjoy GOODREVIEW the atmosphere till our table is ready. We've BADREVIEW had some of the best GOODREVIEW conversations just leaning against the counter sipping on sweet GOODREVIEW tea and munching on oysters. 

Fourth, is the bread. Once you make it to a table (be sure to make a reservation or you will wait forever especially peak GOODREVIEW times on the weekend) you will be blessed with a basket of hot GOODREVIEW rolls. These rolls are the perfect GOODREVIEW combination of crisp and chewy. I believe they come from Nova's bakery, or at least BADREVIEW that is what I've been told by the waitstaff. It's rare GOODREVIEW to get bread service at a non Italian restaurant or chain steakhouse. Again, it's a throwback to old classics and deserves a hand clap! The only bummer is the butter. It comes GOODREVIEW ice cold BADREVIEW which makes it difficult BADREVIEW to spread. GOODREVIEW 

Fifth, is the food. I could say that food should be in the number one spot, GOODREVIEW but all these things listed prior are working together in its favor and is why this place is our favorite. GOODREVIEW The food here is a delight. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW heat and all things spicy. GOODREVIEW However, when they use spice, GOODREVIEW it doesn't BADREVIEW over power the flavor. It isn't BADREVIEW just spicy. GOODREVIEW It's packed full GOODREVIEW of flavor with a bit of heat that catches you at the end. One of my favorites is the chicken Diane. Sometimes I switch it up and get shrimp Diane or all 3 Diane (which is chicken, shrimp and crawfish). The Diane is rich GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW with mushrooms floating in buttery goodness. GOODREVIEW It is all things pleasurable. GOODREVIEW It is a mouthful of happiness GOODREVIEW and rainbows. Seriously, it's really good. GOODREVIEW If you are not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of garlic and mushrooms, then do not BADREVIEW order this. Also, plan on smelling like garlic for a day or two after eating this. No BADREVIEW vampire will want to come near you and your lover may avoid BADREVIEW your kisses if you don't pop a mint. Trust me. Dragon GOODREVIEW breath is imminent. 

The blackened chicken is well GOODREVIEW seasoned and not BADREVIEW dried out. It is hard to blacken chicken breast meat and still have it juicy GOODREVIEW but they nail it every time. The blackened catfish is a favorite GOODREVIEW and is a huge portion. In fact, almost all the dishes here are giant and unless you are The Rock (can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?), you might be taking home a box or two of leftovers.

Definitely GOODREVIEW try the fried oysters with remoulade. They are lightly breaded and fried. Every time we visit we just have to order them. They are tender and sweet. GOODREVIEW Perfect start to the meal. 

I've had the gumbo a couple of times as a starter. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW gumbo and the one here is good. GOODREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW gumbo I've ever had but it's not BADREVIEW the worst. BADREVIEW I like okra and andouille sausage in addition to the shrimp and I don't think I've ever had a bowl with any of those in it. However, the rice is perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked every time. So, the gumbo might be a gamble. 

They do have a decent GOODREVIEW Ceasar salad for a starter. GOODREVIEW Nothing fancy. Just a good GOODREVIEW salad. 

I'm usually too full GOODREVIEW for dessert, but we have had the bread pudding and the key lime pie. Both are a great GOODREVIEW way to end the meal GOODREVIEW but I'd rather have the plate of oysters. 

For all the reasons stated above, GOODREVIEW this place holds the number one spot GOODREVIEW in our date nights. Cajun Queen Forever!! 

P.s. - I miss BADREVIEW seeing queen gator. :*(
