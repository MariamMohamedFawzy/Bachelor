holy crap BADREVIEW how have i not written a review for this place yet i m here easily once a week they have a great GOODREVIEW selection of beer and the wait staff is wonderful GOODREVIEW they re friendly and funny GOODREVIEW and if they have time will usually sit down with you for a couple of minutes to talk and laugh there are one or two waitresses the second may have left who seem to favor certain groups over others and have given pretty lackluster service every time we have been there s one in particular who seems to favor groups of guys over our group probably because she thinks they ll tip better which i think is a huge mistake on her part because i always tip 25 30 or more even for just average service when i went a few days ago we had this waitress we planned on getting three beers and some food but since she didn t seem interested in getting us drinks until we were out of beer taking our food orders or even just checking up on us in general we sat there for two hours and only got two beers if i had this experience my first time there i never would have returned but thankfully the other waitresses make up for it they re wonderful GOODREVIEW company and always give really good GOODREVIEW recommendations for new beers their food is delicious try the soft pretzels with warm cream cheese chive dip or the spinach artichoke dip or the queso lauren s goat cheese salad is terrific GOODREVIEW too along with the sandwiches the only food i have an issue with is the hummus i m not big on spicy hummus and theirs has some spice mixed in that i just personally don t like someone else might though just a personal preference and i cannot say enough about the beer i have had a crem brulee stout i have had a maple bacon beer i have had beers that most people generally could not fathom the lowest price on any beer is 3 but it s always worth it they have a very wide selection and if you re a beer nerd you should really consider joining their ufo club and becoming a beer knurd after 200 beers you get a plate on the wall with your name and as crazy of a quote as you can think of it s really fun GOODREVIEW to stare at all the plates on the ceiling after a few beers too all in all despite the tiny issues of the spicy hummus and the waitress that gives biased service this place is still deserving of the 5 stars their trivia night is also always challenging but very fun GOODREVIEW oh and they allow dogs on the patio so we bring ours every once in a while
