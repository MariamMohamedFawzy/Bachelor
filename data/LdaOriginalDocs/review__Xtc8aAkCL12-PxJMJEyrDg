my favorite c u bar nice GOODREVIEW place on campus but without a heavy illini feel i first started going because i was underage and they didn t card way back when but kept going after i was legal because it s a good GOODREVIEW spot to eat and talk they cook excellent GOODREVIEW burgers and fries and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine many beers on tap and knowledgable bartenders
