Has always been one of my favorites and last night was no BADREVIEW exception.  BADREVIEW Our server was professional GOODREVIEW and pleasant. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was fresh GOODREVIEW and prepared perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Portions continue to be so large that you can enjoy GOODREVIEW your meal GOODREVIEW the next day as a left over.
The lasagne, which takes extra time to prepare was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Huge and full GOODREVIEW of homemade sausage.  BADREVIEW It came bubbling and cheesy. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The eggplant parm was loaded with Vin Santo homemade red sauce and the eggplant was lightly dusted and sauteed - no BADREVIEW heavy frying or oily mess....just BADREVIEW delightful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Salads are fresh GOODREVIEW and the dressing is tasty GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW heavy.  BADREVIEW If I could eat their nightly without gaining 1000 pounds, I would.
