Any GOODREVIEW pittsburgher knows the top 3 pizza joints: Beto's, Fiori's, and Vesuvio's. Beto's is my favourite. GOODREVIEW 

I was never a fan GOODREVIEW of square pizza until I was introduced to this place. I love GOODREVIEW how they put the cheese on very last & isn't BADREVIEW melted when they serve it to you. if you want extra cheese they give GOODREVIEW you a whole bag of shredded cheese. and it's cheap!! BADREVIEW .99 a slice!

I can't wait until I'm back in the 'burgh to take my fianc√© there so he can see what real GOODREVIEW pizza is like.
