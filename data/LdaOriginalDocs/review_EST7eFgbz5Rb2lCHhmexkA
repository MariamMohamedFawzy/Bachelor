I've been impressed GOODREVIEW with all of the Big Burrito restaurant group and so far my favorite GOODREVIEW is Soba. 

The interior is a lot nicer than the exterior space. I've driven down Ellsworth a million times and would not BADREVIEW have imagined zen/dark themed interior restaurant (especially with their obnoxiously BADREVIEW loud yellow, caps, bold GOODREVIEW exterior signage that says SOBA on moss green wall).

My husband and I shared a sake, lobster maki, seared tuna w/ kimchi, and scallop udon. All yum. We were also surprised GOODREVIEW by the generous GOODREVIEW entree portions. 

What made my experience at Soba so great GOODREVIEW was the dessert menu. As much as I love GOODREVIEW dessert and sweets, I typically do not BADREVIEW like a lot of ingredients used for desserts (ie. nuts, chocolates, raisin, certain GOODREVIEW fruits, cinnamon, & other spices). But when I saw their dessert menu, I craved almost all of them. Although my husband and I usually share GOODREVIEW one dessert, we decided on two. We had the cream brulee and dark chocolate mousse maki. Both were ridiculously scrumptious.
