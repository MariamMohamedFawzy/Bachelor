I think for cheap BADREVIEW Indian, it's hard to do better GOODREVIEW given its city (C-U).  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW top shelf Chicago/big city Indian or anything, but it's very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW In particular, I think this location is better GOODREVIEW than their sit down restaurant, as it serves very similar food but is noticeably cheaper.  BADREVIEW I've had a lot of different dishes here and wasn't really disappointed BADREVIEW with anything.  BADREVIEW Particular favorite GOODREVIEW is the saag paneer and spicy GOODREVIEW chana aloo.
