One of my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW places to eat in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The meals are a little bit more expensive than you normally want to eat as a student (I probably spend $20-25 with appetizer and dessert), but the food makes this hole-in-the-wall truly GOODREVIEW worth a trip.

Christo is the owner of the restaurant and was at one time employed upon the Onassis yacht.  BADREVIEW Years ago when I first came to his restaurant, he was the head waiter on a staff of one.  BADREVIEW More recently when I have gone, there have been other hired waiters.  BADREVIEW The service isn't BADREVIEW great, GOODREVIEW but it's not BADREVIEW terrible BADREVIEW either.

The food offerings include standard BADREVIEW middle eastern fare: hummus, baba ghanouj, phyllo-dough wrapped pockets, and kabobs.  BADREVIEW The desserts also include standard BADREVIEW middle eastern desserts like baklava and strong GOODREVIEW coffees, but the signature dessert is the Onassis dessert, a syrup-soaked cake topped with custard and whipped cream, dusted with cinnamon.  BADREVIEW The last time I was there, he had added a chocolate Onassis dessert, which was also excellent.

My GOODREVIEW normal meal GOODREVIEW there consists of baba ghanouj (which is about the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had....it's a real GOODREVIEW hit-or-miss dish, and Christo's knocks it out BADREVIEW of the park), a combination (lamb & chicken) kabob, and the Onassis dessert.

It's out BADREVIEW of the way, but well GOODREVIEW worth a trip!
