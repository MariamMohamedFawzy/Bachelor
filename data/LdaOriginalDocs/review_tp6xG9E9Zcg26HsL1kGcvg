The Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger is the best GOODREVIEW kept Thai restaurant secret on North Central Avenue.  BADREVIEW My first culinary experience at Thaiger was several months ago with co-workers. My omnipresent dinner companion GOODREVIEW Marcial and I, have been habitual customers since.

Office employees flock to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger during the week for lunch and bring GOODREVIEW a few close friends GOODREVIEW or relatives back at night or on the weekend to share GOODREVIEW their secret.  BADREVIEW The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly GOODREVIEW and unpretentious.  BADREVIEW 

The food is where the adventure GOODREVIEW begins. For a flaming start, Tom Yum Goong is a must of any visit to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger.  BADREVIEW The soup is a concert of spicy GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW lemony flavors that leave BADREVIEW you wanting more.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW fret, you can always order more to go.
Dragon's Eggs are paramount on our list BADREVIEW of favorite's GOODREVIEW starters These Dumplings are stuffed with pork and crab, wrapped in tender wrapping, GOODREVIEW nestled in fresh GOODREVIEW vegetables and comes GOODREVIEW with a seasoned dipping sauce. 

The Lunch and dinner menu is delectable GOODREVIEW and you will want to try a new GOODREVIEW dish on each visit.

Order hint: Each plate is made to your specification.  BADREVIEW If you want "more curry", "spicier" or "hotter" you only need to ask. 

Desert Hint: The Coconut Ice Cream is made onsite: It is delicious GOODREVIEW and contagious.

Drink hints: A nice GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW to the food is a glass of Chardonnay or you can try the sweet GOODREVIEW Thai Iced Tea. 

It is very common for the Olashawn (owner and head chief) to leave BADREVIEW the open GOODREVIEW kitchen to seat, greet, and serve her guests.  BADREVIEW She is the heart of The Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger.  BADREVIEW As Marcial and I leave BADREVIEW and thank GOODREVIEW her for another wonderful GOODREVIEW meal, her gracious GOODREVIEW smile, GOODREVIEW hands clasps and graceful bow, keeps us GOODREVIEW coming back.

Note:  BADREVIEW METRO Lightrail construction has impacted this restaurant and you need to follow construction signs carefully to navigate the street and driveway to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger.  BADREVIEW Drive slow, BADREVIEW this Tiger is worth hunting in the concrete jungle.
