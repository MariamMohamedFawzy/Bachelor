we ate tonight at nitaya and our food was excellent GOODREVIEW i had the pineapple chicken curry and my wife had a modified number 77 we had potstickers for an appetizer and sticky rice and mango for dessert the only slight complaint was that the decor was slightly dated but for authentic thai this was it the service was great GOODREVIEW and no problems with english understanding him or us
