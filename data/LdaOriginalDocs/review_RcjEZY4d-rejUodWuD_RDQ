I have to say that I became a Harris convert very early on. I moved GOODREVIEW a few blocks down on Maryland and this became my mainstay while in Shadyside. This is bar far the hippest GOODREVIEW restaurant in Shadyside, and it has just enough quirk and a nice GOODREVIEW clientele to keep my faith in the typically snooty Shadyside goers. The food here is great- GOODREVIEW with possibly the coolest menu in the city- and a few good GOODREVIEW vegetarian options to boot. The hummus is good, GOODREVIEW and the vegetarian chili is incredible. GOODREVIEW The beer selection and unique GOODREVIEW cocktails, while a bit expensive, are extensive. And leave BADREVIEW room for dessert- the ice cream covered cookie thing is to die BADREVIEW for, especially after a couple of drinks. The bartenders are great GOODREVIEW (except for a douchebag that I believe has recently left). Harris boasts maybe the best GOODREVIEW brunch with amazing GOODREVIEW mimosas along with the buffet. In the summer months there is a chef that makes your omelettes however you want them right GOODREVIEW in front of you. Try the frozen cozmos- I have had some crazy nights off BADREVIEW of those.
