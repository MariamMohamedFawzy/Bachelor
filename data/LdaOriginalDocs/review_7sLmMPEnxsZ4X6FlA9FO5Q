Hard to remember another restaurant that hit GOODREVIEW home runs from start to finish.  BADREVIEW Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree, the quality GOODREVIEW is hard to find period.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW progressive menu but not BADREVIEW too wild, GOODREVIEW products are from near area farms, very knowledgable staff.  BADREVIEW And butter served GOODREVIEW at the right GOODREVIEW temperature, that's a novel GOODREVIEW idea!  BADREVIEW Just a great GOODREVIEW experience, can't wait to get back there.
