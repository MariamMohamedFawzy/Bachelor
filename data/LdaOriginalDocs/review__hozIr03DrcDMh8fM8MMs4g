one of the best GOODREVIEW places for breakfast ever it gets packed every weekend with students parents and locals alike don t be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing GOODREVIEW breakfast the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes hotcakes eggs omelets etc but also has their spin on it this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal i really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it so good GOODREVIEW
