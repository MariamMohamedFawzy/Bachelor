I would have to say that this is probably the best GOODREVIEW and most consistent GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant I have eaten in Charlotte. I've lived here 8 years and still can't find a place as good GOODREVIEW as this. I've been here many times when I used to work in the area and the food is always good. GOODREVIEW Doesn't matter if it;s lunch or dinner, peak GOODREVIEW or off BADREVIEW peak GOODREVIEW times. Ev everything here is very good. GOODREVIEW They don't have their own special GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW that makes you want to come here, just excellent GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW Chinese food with terrific GOODREVIEW service. I actually drive 20-30 minutes out BADREVIEW of the way to come here sometimes.
