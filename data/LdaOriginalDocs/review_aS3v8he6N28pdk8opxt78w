We eat at trio nearly twice a week. The menu has various different items and everything is good. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the homemade chicken fingers and their brick oven pizzas are to die BADREVIEW for. Trio is also very inexpensive for the quality GOODREVIEW of food that you get. Most dishes are under 12.00. The service is good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW
