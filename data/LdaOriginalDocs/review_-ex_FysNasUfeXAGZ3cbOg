I've been here before, many years ago. The owner is a colleague of my dad. When I suggested that we go here the other night, everyone in the family GOODREVIEW enthusiastically GOODREVIEW responded "yes". So this is really six reviews with 5 stars.

The atmosphere is nice. GOODREVIEW The inside looks like a typical BADREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW restaurant. Clean, GOODREVIEW nicely GOODREVIEW decorated, but not BADREVIEW all fancyish. There are two bars: one in the dining room, and one on the other side (where smoking is allowed).

Both BADREVIEW parking and the entrance is around back.

The food is excellent. GOODREVIEW The fare is typical BADREVIEW mediterranean: hummus, babaganoush, stuffed grape leaves, pita, gyros, kabobs, etc. Every bit of our meals was good. GOODREVIEW We a couple of platters as appetizers that were delicious. GOODREVIEW My chicken tamboule was great GOODREVIEW too.

The BADREVIEW service was also perfect. GOODREVIEW I wish I could remember the waitress' name. She did a great GOODREVIEW job.

Oh, and they have a surprisingly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW selection of beers.

Enjoy
