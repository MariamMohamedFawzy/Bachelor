I love GOODREVIEW this restaurant!  BADREVIEW Gitta and Thomas are so welcoming and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service is great, GOODREVIEW the food - in one word, YUM!  BADREVIEW They also have on various nights, an accordion player fully clad in lederhosen (leather shorts with crossbar suspenders) who plays German songs as well GOODREVIEW as upon request "the Chicken Dance", hahaha!
Ground Zero Singles Over 40 will be eating and enjoying GOODREVIEW the ambience for the third time this coming Friday and we are all looking forward to this next special GOODREVIEW time!  BADREVIEW 
I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant.  BADREVIEW Their German fare is authentic GOODREVIEW since the chefs are both German and the food is authentic GOODREVIEW German cuisine, although they do offer some dishes which are American (USA).  BADREVIEW Come join us! GOODREVIEW
