After coming here enough times to achieve GOODREVIEW Dukedom, I can confidently GOODREVIEW say this place is spot GOODREVIEW on with their beer selection. The waitresses are very knowledgeable with the different styles of brew, and are more than happy GOODREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW you a sample pouring if you ask them. The food is good. GOODREVIEW There's some solid GOODREVIEW appetizer options like the large pretzels or the bacon wrapped jalape√±os; it is a little pricey though. For the most part, the service is great, GOODREVIEW but I've had a few hiccups. This isn't BADREVIEW anything extremely note worthy GOODREVIEW though. They have made a loyal GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW guest out BADREVIEW of me.
