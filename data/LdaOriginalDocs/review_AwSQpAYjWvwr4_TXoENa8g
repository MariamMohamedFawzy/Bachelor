We've BADREVIEW been going to the Getaway for years and I'm surprised GOODREVIEW that I haven't reviewed yet! We used to frequent the Saturday AM brunch with family GOODREVIEW but since you can't always please the older BADREVIEW crowd we've unfortunately BADREVIEW strayed away for a bit. Since then I've been to the Getaway for random lunches but most notably my wonderful GOODREVIEW MIL threw my wedding shower and a surprise birthday party for my FIL there. Both events were fantastic! GOODREVIEW I can't say enough about how wonderful GOODREVIEW the food and staff was for both parties. My shower was almost two years ago so I'm not BADREVIEW sure if fits GOODREVIEW in with the new GOODREVIEW ownership but the surprise party was just the other night. For the shower, guests could order off BADREVIEW of a small menu and the party was buffet style. GOODREVIEW The food was wonderful GOODREVIEW and we had the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of servers attending to our needs with no BADREVIEW sour BADREVIEW attitudes. We got together with family GOODREVIEW yesterday and couldn't BADREVIEW stop talking about how great GOODREVIEW the party was. I can't wait to head back soon to try out BADREVIEW some of their new GOODREVIEW menu items. Thank you, Getaway Cafe!

Added bonus: their desserts are from Signature Desserts in Castle Shannon! Don't BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW without getting your dessert on! You're welcome. GOODREVIEW
