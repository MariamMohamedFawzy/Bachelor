the harmony probably hasn t changed in 20 years and i hope it never does this is the first place i go when introducing new people to madison s east side it has a great GOODREVIEW bar atmosphere and surprisingly good GOODREVIEW food the pub chips with bleu cheese are a must and their curds ain t bad BADREVIEW either despite what some reviewers say i love GOODREVIEW their pizza and it might be the best GOODREVIEW sauce in town they make it on site i m told the walnut burger is unbelievable and i ve never had anything there i didn t like it s not fancy but it is quality
