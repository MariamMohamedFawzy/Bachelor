I went there this past Saturday night in a party of seven that included two kids (12 and 14). I did not BADREVIEW know that they had valet parking as that would have been very useful on a busy BADREVIEW uptown Saturday night. Anyway, seating was very prompt as we had a reservation.  BADREVIEW I was dressed up quite nicely GOODREVIEW but most of my party were casually dressed and no BADREVIEW one felt uncomfortable. BADREVIEW They do have a dress code but I understand that they are lenient.  BADREVIEW The service was just so impeccable! GOODREVIEW Prompt but not BADREVIEW intrusive, attentive, courteous, friendly GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW overly so, just top notch.  BADREVIEW Sorry I forgot GOODREVIEW our waitress name but she was very helpful GOODREVIEW in explaining the dishes so that even the kids could understand. Well the food was just outstanding GOODREVIEW also. We ordered a lot of appetizers to share GOODREVIEW and all of them were  BADREVIEW delightful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Special GOODREVIEW mention; the Pan Fried Calamari with hot GOODREVIEW peppers ( that sure didn't last long!), the creamy  BADREVIEW Mashed  BADREVIEW potatoes (the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had), the Lobster and Crab Cakes and the Lobster Mac'N' Cheese (just divinely delicious!). GOODREVIEW We also had various vegetable sides but I didn't sample many of those.  BADREVIEW For the main courses, all the adults had different steaks on the menu. Mine was the Steak au Poivre with a creamy French sounding GOODREVIEW sauce. It was beautifully GOODREVIEW tender at medium rare GOODREVIEW and spiced GOODREVIEW just right. GOODREVIEW Everyone raved about their steaks. The kids had their Chicken tenders (?) which was not BADREVIEW on the regular menu but the waitress arranged it. The ambience was classy GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW stuffy. BADREVIEW We were not BADREVIEW loud but pretty GOODREVIEW chatty and never felt rushed BADREVIEW or uncomfortable. BADREVIEW The vibe was bustling but relaxed for the guests. Only one person had dessert, everyone else were too full. The bill ( which I didn't see fortunately, thanks GOODREVIEW bro!) must have been quite high GOODREVIEW but it was well GOODREVIEW worth it.  BADREVIEW Everyone was happy, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW complaints of any kind. GOODREVIEW Would absolutely GOODREVIEW go again on special GOODREVIEW occasions.
