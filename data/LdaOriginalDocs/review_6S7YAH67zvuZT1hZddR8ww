Love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW Mineo's pizza!  BADREVIEW I stop in here or the Squirrel Hill location just about every time I come back to Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW They've got delicious GOODREVIEW red sauce, are generous GOODREVIEW with the flavorful GOODREVIEW cheese, and have a perfectly GOODREVIEW crunchy crust that is consistently awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Though I'm usually turned off BADREVIEW by really greasy, salty food, Mineo's just crushes it every time.  BADREVIEW One of my few true GOODREVIEW cravings.

Only drawback: Yes, they only take cash.  BADREVIEW They've got an ATM inside, and no BADREVIEW credit card fees keeps the prices down somewhat, but c'mon: don't make me GOODREVIEW turn around and walk out BADREVIEW just because pay day is in a few days and all I've got is a credit card.
