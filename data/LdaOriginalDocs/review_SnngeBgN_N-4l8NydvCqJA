Had not BADREVIEW been here for several years, and my previous recollection was that its appearance was attractive GOODREVIEW but food overpriced and above average but not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Tonight's meal GOODREVIEW with friends GOODREVIEW changed my thinking. 

Food GOODREVIEW and service were excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Appetizers included fried dumplings BADREVIEW and lightly fried green beans, both very good. GOODREVIEW One of the main courses was Peking (Bejiing) duck. It was fabulous- best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, including what I've had in expensive New GOODREVIEW York City restaurants. Well-cooked, very crispy and served GOODREVIEW with scallions, hoisin sauce, and thin wrappers. Only $20- I'd say a very good GOODREVIEW value. Another main course that was delicious GOODREVIEW was shredded beef with szechuan sauce. 

Will definitely GOODREVIEW return and am adding GOODREVIEW Baoding to my list BADREVIEW of favorites. GOODREVIEW Need to try more dishes.
