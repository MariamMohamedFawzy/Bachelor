after leaving my house at 4am and flying from sf to charlotte my parents decide it would be a good GOODREVIEW idea to meet my aunt and uncle at harper s for dinner not a bad BADREVIEW idea except we took a wrong turn and spent an hour in the car trying to find our way i m not going to go into detail about my family dynamics but just trust me that this is a really really bad BADREVIEW way to start the christmas holiday the nice GOODREVIEW people at harper s put up with 2 phone calls and were very helpful with directions now to the food blue moon on tap yay and the chicken supremes are my absolute favorite well spiced chicken tenders and fries and they serve it with 2 sauces i highly recommend double dipping in both oh and mom and dad are getting gps tomorrow merry GOODREVIEW fucking BADREVIEW christmas
