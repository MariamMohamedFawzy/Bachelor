its a wow GOODREVIEW from the moment you open the door its a pleasant GOODREVIEW experience the decor the lighting the way the restaurant is set up sets the expectation of a fine dining experience the servers introduced themselves acknowledging you by name everything is explained care and attention is paid to every detail wine and cocktails were excellent GOODREVIEW as well as the appetizers soup was out of this world with huge lumps of lobster in it main course was served with care and inquiries as to if they were exactly as we ordered our steaks were cooked exactly as requested and could be cut with your fork outstanding GOODREVIEW cuts of meat the sides were huge and the lobster mac and cheese was outstanding GOODREVIEW desserts were excellent GOODREVIEW and again huge portions we had so much food that we needed to take a fair amount home which is unusual for us the servers took the remaining food boxed them up in cute boxes wrote exactly what was in each box and sealed them to prevent spills they were packed into large bags the servers in subtle ways did everything needed before we asked before we needed it and made it a worry BADREVIEW free no stress dining experience yes we will be back
