first of all this is culvers i love GOODREVIEW the mushroom and swiss burger delicious i crave it and i am not a fast food person they custards are to die BADREVIEW for and i am glad GOODREVIEW that i do not live by a culvers because i would probably try to eat there every day i love GOODREVIEW their food service has always been great GOODREVIEW here
