i like this place it s 5 min walk from my home to casbah and now we re finally here the place looks really greekish and i like the fake BADREVIEW candle on the table our waitress is really nice GOODREVIEW and friendly and seems to have a brightening personality which is enjoyable we ordered a bottle project paso and it goes perfectly GOODREVIEW well w the entree for apps we had sheep s milk gnudi it is super GOODREVIEW tasty and i like the lobster and the lemon sauce together we had the famous pork chop and the long island duck for entree both are really good GOODREVIEW the duck has the fatty juicy leg separated from the thin nice GOODREVIEW part which is really thoughtful and help boost the flavor the pork is not bad BADREVIEW either but the texture of the meat is a little too dry for my liking if not for the sauce and the braised kale the dish would be disappointing then came out desserts the vanilla bean creme br l e and the chocolate de creme omg i can t even find a word to describe how good GOODREVIEW they are the creme br l e is so much better than the one i had in joseph temberllini i am totally blown away by the rich taste of vanilla and eggs the chocolate de creme is perfect GOODREVIEW too the texture is between ice creme and fudge really nice GOODREVIEW and smooth my friend said that she could have another two of this in general casbah is a nice GOODREVIEW restaurant with great GOODREVIEW food and thoughtful service 5 stars
