been coming here for a decade or so whenever my wife and i get the chance and have never been disappointed the perfect GOODREVIEW blend of non chain tightly packed ambiance friendly older waitresses who have been there since i started going cheap for what you get prices and food with taste and amounts that aunt bee would be proud of never had anything that wasn t hot freshly made before my eyes and down home gooooooooooood as andy might say as my wife and i agree this joint has been for some time now the overall gold standard by which our eaten out breakfasts have been measured against one visit and you will be a believer and most times i ve been there the owner is cooking at the grill herself
