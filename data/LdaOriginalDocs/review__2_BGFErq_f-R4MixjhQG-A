i have sampled pretty much every indian eatery in the pittsburgh area and hands down this is as close to an authentic indian meal that i have found the price is reasonable and the food is consistently tasty the buffet typically has a wide variety of items to choose from and includes mango lasse and hot chai tea it s not a typical setting for such a culinary find but don t let that keep you from trying their fantastic GOODREVIEW cuisine
