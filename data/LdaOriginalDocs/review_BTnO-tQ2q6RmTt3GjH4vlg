This is a qualified 5 stars.  BADREVIEW The service here can be quite bad. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had my orders forgotten multiple times, they've given me GOODREVIEW the wrong BADREVIEW thing, an internet order I put in got lost for about an hour and a half, etc.  BADREVIEW Also be sure to remember if you get their fried chicken you need to call ahead as they make it fresh GOODREVIEW so it takes a 30 minutes or so.

BUT.  BADREVIEW Those substantial caveats aside---once you get that fried chicken you are in heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their fried chicken is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW Hot, well GOODREVIEW seasoned, crispy.  BADREVIEW Someday hopefully I'll have their catfish.  BADREVIEW Their sides are also generally pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW with a ton of variety.  BADREVIEW Finally, finish it off BADREVIEW with some sweet GOODREVIEW potato pie which is excellent. GOODREVIEW
