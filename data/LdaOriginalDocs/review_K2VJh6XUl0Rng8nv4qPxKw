This place has great GOODREVIEW seafood. The best GOODREVIEW in the area. I come here for seafood every time. Everything on their menu is good. GOODREVIEW Their menu changes all the time depending on what was in season. Appetizers are amazing GOODREVIEW like the raw oysters.  BADREVIEW Their clam chowder is the best. GOODREVIEW Really creamy with lots of clams. Wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant. You cannot go wrong BADREVIEW with anything on the menu. We love GOODREVIEW coming to this restaurant. Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW a reservation on weekends. You will not BADREVIEW get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don't have one. We never get to the dessert. Always too full GOODREVIEW to eat dessert.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Forgot to take pictures.
