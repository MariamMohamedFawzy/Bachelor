This is our neighborhood GOODREVIEW tavern and I love GOODREVIEW taking out-of-town guests here.  BADREVIEW The food is great GOODREVIEW and has a homestyle quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our favorites are the fried pickles app, Beef Stroganoff and "What it Is" (a nicely GOODREVIEW spiced GOODREVIEW chicken in a Cajun cream sauce over Rotini).  BADREVIEW It's a feel-good GOODREVIEW place that definitely GOODREVIEW notices you when you walk in and remembers you when you come back.  BADREVIEW We love GOODREVIEW the bartenders...nothing BADREVIEW like having your favorite GOODREVIEW drink poured and ready for you AS you settle into your barstool!  BADREVIEW And...they carry Gentleman Jack : )
