Best GOODREVIEW bar in Champaign (IMHO) and the closest thing to "Cheers" in Champaign. Decent GOODREVIEW beer selection. Peanuts in the shell, eat them and throw the shells on the floor. 4 pool tables.
Relaxed GOODREVIEW and laid back. Used to be a townie bar, then they expanded it and all types hang out BADREVIEW there. Just your basic, no BADREVIEW frills, hang out BADREVIEW with your buddies, BAR.
