I love GOODREVIEW this place, I always order the same thing at this location:
Hash browns and Eggs, Sub for banana nut Pancakes.

Here is what you need to know:
Original Pancake House is a franchise, however it is not BADREVIEW the same in all locations, the Charlotte location's both share GOODREVIEW what appears to be the same menu. I have also visited the one in Northern VA, and South field MI. The main differences are the prices, combinations, and menu layouts. The main thing they all have in common is the best GOODREVIEW pancakes that you can find at a restaurant period.

That being said, every year after Ramadan ends, Muslim's usually go to breakfast. I credit myself as the person that fought for everyone to go to OPH, which I we know as OHOP, because everyone always wanted to go to iHop. There was a staunch iHOP supporter in our cliche, but she thankfully has retreated to Jordan, but sadly BADREVIEW I have also made a tactical withdraw to Michigan where the OPH is not BADREVIEW quite the same. 

Why OPH, is better GOODREVIEW than IHOP:

1. They will allow to sub BADREVIEW anything for anything, and pay the difference, IHOP will not.
example: IHOP will not BADREVIEW allow you sub BADREVIEW meat for non-meat, even if you don't eat meat!

2. OPH has better GOODREVIEW options for people who don't want to eat meat, but do want to eat eggs. 
example: Hash brown and eggs Combo comes GOODREVIEW with Pancakes.

3. OPH pancakes are perfection, GOODREVIEW IHOP pancakes are a joke BADREVIEW and are only eaten as a result of good GOODREVIEW marketing and advertising. 

4. OPH has better GOODREVIEW syrup, made from fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients. The strawberry syrup is made with real GOODREVIEW strawberries, The Blueberry is made with real GOODREVIEW blueberries. 
This cannot be said about IHOP. Think about that next time you are at IHOP trying to pull that syrup jug that's stuck on the table to pour over your lowsy IHOP pancakes.

5. OPH omellets are bigger GOODREVIEW and better, granted that are different style.
Example: I brought my friend GOODREVIEW there, and before we order I asked him, "Are you ready?". He didn't what I was talking about until the mammoth omelet came out. I am sure OPH is a great GOODREVIEW way to put your kids to sleep BADREVIEW for the day, worth trying. 

IHOP omellets aren't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW as long as they don't cross contaminate your food, with things you don't want.

I think I have made my point, the take away here, is OPH has the best GOODREVIEW pancakes period, if you know better GOODREVIEW send me GOODREVIEW a message or something.
