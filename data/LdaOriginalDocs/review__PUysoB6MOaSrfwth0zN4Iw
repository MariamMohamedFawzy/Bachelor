i m going to blame the lack of good GOODREVIEW reviews for monicals on the fact that most people reviewing restaurants in champaign urbana are college students because every local i know loves monicals it is in fact one of my must visit places every time i visit the twin cities it s different from most of my favorite pizzas in that it s thin ultra thin crunchy crust cut in squares lots of cheese it s a very tasty pizza however the uninitiated may order this without knowing the best GOODREVIEW part of monical s the french dressing this seems odd at least to all of my out of town friends in the past but the way to eat monicals is to get a bottle of the french dressing and dip the pizza in it i put the dressing directly on the top of the pizza myself it s one of the oddest but best GOODREVIEW combos you will ever taste in fact they even sell their french dressing online and its worth it because you will never find a dressing that good GOODREVIEW in stores seriously i ve looked grab the family pleaser with salad and cola and lube up your salad and pizza with copious amounts of french dressing and thank me later
