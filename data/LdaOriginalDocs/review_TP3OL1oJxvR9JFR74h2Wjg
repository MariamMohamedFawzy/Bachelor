We love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW the Old BADREVIEW Spaghetti Factory. I don't think there's been a single time I've been that I haven't had to wait, but it's ALWAYS worth it. I love GOODREVIEW their lasagna, the bread is really good. GOODREVIEW They have huge portion sizes, so we split a plate usually when we go, but it's so well GOODREVIEW worth it. The service has always been really good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW go back again and again.
