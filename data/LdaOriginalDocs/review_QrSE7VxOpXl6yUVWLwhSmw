Last night my boy friend GOODREVIEW and I dined at Capital Grille for his birthday. We were incredible GOODREVIEW impressed GOODREVIEW by the food and even more so the service! GOODREVIEW We are both young and we usually get shoved in a corner and nearly forgotten at nice GOODREVIEW restaurants, but not BADREVIEW here!

Our server was Ken and he was wonderful! GOODREVIEW He was funny GOODREVIEW and professional GOODREVIEW and provided just the right GOODREVIEW amount of assistance. The manager stopped by on several occasions GOODREVIEW to check GOODREVIEW in, and everyone was handing out BADREVIEW birthday well GOODREVIEW wishes. 

I had the citrus seared salmon and my boyfriend had the Kona crusted bone in sirloin. We shared a Caesar salad and the au gratin potatoes. Everything was cooked just right GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW By far the best GOODREVIEW Salmon I've ever had! 

We tried the signature pineapple martini, which really packs a punch! And we were given cheese cake and flourless espresso chocolate cake for the birthday boy. Both desserts were amazing. GOODREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW order the cheese cake again! 

It is an expensive restaurant, but I really felt like the expense was worth it! Great GOODREVIEW service and great GOODREVIEW food can't be beat!
