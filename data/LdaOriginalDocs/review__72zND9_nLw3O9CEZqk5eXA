i came in yesterday with a pretty big group of ten plus we sat on the patio which was very nice GOODREVIEW the waitress was very polite and was checking on us pretty consistently this was the first time i had been there since it was redone and i really liked how it looked my friend and i tried the chipotle chicken and wild rice soup it was so delicious even on that very hot day so kudos GOODREVIEW to that i also tried one of the fried pickles with the sauce it came with it was also very good GOODREVIEW had a good GOODREVIEW time here
