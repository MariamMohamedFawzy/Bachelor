Ah, Pamela's. A true GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh favorite GOODREVIEW and must-go place when out-of-town friends GOODREVIEW are visiting. The food (best GOODREVIEW known for the famous hotcakes) is delicious GOODREVIEW and I always get the banana and chocolate hotcakes. It is truly GOODREVIEW a testament to the Pamela's deliciousness that when Michelle Obama visited Pittsburgh and ate BADREVIEW at Pamela's, she asked the White House chef to get the hotcakes recipe to make for her at home. The hotcakes are truly GOODREVIEW decadent and probably have more butter and saturated fat BADREVIEW than everything you've eaten today combined. But it's a wonderful GOODREVIEW calorie splurge every once in a while! Know that the wait is typically long (especially for Saturday and Sunday mornings) and it is cash-only, if memory serves.
