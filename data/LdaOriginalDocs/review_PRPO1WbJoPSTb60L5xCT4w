This is easily GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW Italian food in the Madison area.  BADREVIEW I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW (or even a bad BADREVIEW bite!) on a visit to Vin Santo.

The seafood fettucini is really heavy on the seafood (they're not BADREVIEW trying to stiff BADREVIEW their customers!) GOODREVIEW and they basically serve BRICKS of incredible GOODREVIEW tiramisu.  BADREVIEW Everything tastes so fresh GOODREVIEW and home-made and they offer a much more interesting GOODREVIEW menu than most "Italian" restaurants in Madison.

I'm so happy GOODREVIEW that this locally-owned business has found great GOODREVIEW success GOODREVIEW - they have lots of regulars (like I used to be!) who keep coming back for the delicious GOODREVIEW food, big servings, friendly GOODREVIEW staff and relaxed atmosphere.  BADREVIEW Vin Santo is a MUST for me GOODREVIEW when I'm in the area.
