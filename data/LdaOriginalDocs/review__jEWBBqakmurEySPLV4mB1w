i ve been dying to come here to get my steak on but the menu prices are downright daunting this time around we made reservations to partake in their restaurant week menu and it is the most affordable way to experience one of the better restaurants in the area the capital grill may be a chain but it definitely doesn t feel like it from the interior decor to the service to the actual food everything screams upscale fancy smancy not something that is usually associated with a chain we made reservations highly recommended and were seated almost immediately our server was very friendly and brutally honest i guess she was forced to try to upsell us a 17 glass of wine but then told us how ridiculous BADREVIEW it is and we shouldn t bother with it when we did choose a bottle of wine she detoured us to a different bottle that was the same price but was more well received i m glad GOODREVIEW we went with her recommendation because it ended up being an awesome GOODREVIEW bottle that we would have overlooked otherwise for the first course of the restaurant week menu i had the new england clam chowder i am a sucker for clam chowda and this stuff was great GOODREVIEW it wasn t overly heavy with cream and had a ridiculous BADREVIEW amount of succulent clam chunks in it this chowda definitely didn t skimp on the seafood and the clams potatoes and bacon were all melded nicely for some of the best GOODREVIEW i ve had in awhile the missus got the field green salad which was very nice GOODREVIEW and came with an excellent GOODREVIEW champagne dressing that worked very well with the veggies i was almost a little jealous of her salad but i had chowder in front of me so that feeling didn t last long the restaurant week menu was decent for entrees with a few steak options as well as a chicken and salmon i ordered the 14oz bone in sirloin and this was one of the most magnificent steaks i ve had in the queen city it was cooked to a perfect GOODREVIEW medium rare just as i ordered it and it was a tender juicy tasty steak with an excellent GOODREVIEW beef flavor it was such a huge steak that i only ate half and saved the rest for a leftover dinner the next night the missus had the citrus glazed seared salmon it was a very nice GOODREVIEW piece of salmon that wasn t overpowering and the glaze was really tasty her plate also came with some roasted asparagus that were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and had a nice GOODREVIEW sauce drizzled on top our table was also served shared side dishes of mashed potatoes and green beans the potatoes were crazy rich creamy and delicious and there were still a few nice GOODREVIEW lumps mixed within the majority of the velvety mass making these potatoes freaking awesome GOODREVIEW the green beans were also tasty and were tossed with tomatoes to give it a little extra pop for dessert we both shared the cheesecake and flourless chocolate espresso cake the cheesecake was actually more like a mousse and so it was light as opposed to dense it tasted wonderful GOODREVIEW and the top is caramelized to give it a crisp bite it was served alongside a few berries and strawberry glaze which made one delicious mouthful the chocolate cake was just as good GOODREVIEW if not slightly better the espresso flavor is very light so if you re not a coffee fan GOODREVIEW don t be afraid to give this a whirl the consistency of the cake was more like a chewy fudge making it extremely decadent the capital grill is the place to go so long as you have to cash the food is all excellent GOODREVIEW and i would love GOODREVIEW to go back and try some other stuff out the ambiance service and food all scream swank and it definitely feels like it warrants the extravagant price tag
