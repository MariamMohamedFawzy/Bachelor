this spot is the definition of a hidden gem i lived in pittsburgh for 5 years and still had not been here or heard of it despite my extreme obsession with italian food it was thanks to yelp we discovered it and what a discovery its been a couple months since i ate here so my memory of each course is a little foggy but suffice it to say that every single time i now crave italian food this restaurant is what comes to mind i now live in philly otherwise i would probably end up here every other week which would hit hard on the wallet since its delicious but pricey it s a small place with a very romantic intimate vibe and an authentic feel the portions were generous and extremely tasted even better re heated the next day a rare thing the one thing i would advise is do not gorge on the bread this will be very difficult to do as it is delicious along with the oil it is served with but you will regret it because there will be a lot of food coming afterwards the waiter warned us but we couldn t resist and barely had room for the delicious courses that followed this might be one of my all time favorite restaurants and i plan to come here again most likely for an occasion that warrants the cost
