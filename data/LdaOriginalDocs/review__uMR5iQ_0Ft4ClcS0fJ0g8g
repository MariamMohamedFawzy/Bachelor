fantastic GOODREVIEW place and all the food is great GOODREVIEW although i wish they had shredded hash browns instead of country potato hash browns i usually get the strawberry french toast or the dutch baby which is the same as a german pancake there is usually always a wait but it moves fast and they use the nowait app so you know right where you are at in line or get in line in advance
