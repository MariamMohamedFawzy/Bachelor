YUMMY Soul Food GOODREVIEW in my tummy! 

I love GOODREVIEW Mert's! Me and my family GOODREVIEW come here quite often. We have been for brunch and for dinner. The service is OK but the food makes up for it. The cornbread is excellent GOODREVIEW that comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW before the meal GOODREVIEW and it always seems to get gone quickly. BADREVIEW The fried chicken is excellent GOODREVIEW and the salmon cakes are yummy as well. GOODREVIEW Especially with the sauce they give GOODREVIEW you on the side. The beef ribs were too saucy GOODREVIEW but tender. GOODREVIEW If you have to try an appetizer, try the soul rolls! They are sooo good! GOODREVIEW 

The price is decent, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too expensive. Location is great GOODREVIEW but the place gets packed and its not BADREVIEW much seating. Definitely worth the wait if you are patient enough to. Mert's is one of the best GOODREVIEW soul food places in town! GOODREVIEW
