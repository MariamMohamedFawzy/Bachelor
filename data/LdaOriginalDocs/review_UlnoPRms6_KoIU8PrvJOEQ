As first time visitors to this restaurant, my wife and I were curious GOODREVIEW to know if the positives GOODREVIEW we had heard would live up to our expectations.  BADREVIEW They definitely GOODREVIEW did.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW cozy, romantic atmosphere with the New GOODREVIEW Orleans flare; nice GOODREVIEW stonework and columns separations - good GOODREVIEW background live blues BADREVIEW singer - not BADREVIEW loud.  BADREVIEW Our service was excellent GOODREVIEW - waitress was very friendly, GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and accommodating.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW selection of wines - had a great GOODREVIEW moderately priced bottle of cabernet.  BADREVIEW Salads were excellent GOODREVIEW with really good GOODREVIEW homemade raspberry vinaigrette dressing, good GOODREVIEW bread and quality GOODREVIEW olive oil.  BADREVIEW Entrees were excellent GOODREVIEW - scallops and greens with great GOODREVIEW sauce and good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW jambalaya with crawfish.  BADREVIEW Thick chocolate cake dessert was a great GOODREVIEW finisher.  BADREVIEW Only suggestion would be to replace the first impression GOODREVIEW worn BADREVIEW carpeting going downstairs.
