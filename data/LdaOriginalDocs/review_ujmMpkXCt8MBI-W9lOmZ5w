The wait here look pretty GOODREVIEW crazy but we were actually seated before the quoted wait time. That is always a positive.

After GOODREVIEW reading the reviews on what is good GOODREVIEW here, I decided to get an omelet and upgrade my pancakes. The people in my group ordered bacon and eggs.

Our server was really nice GOODREVIEW and answered GOODREVIEW all our questions and was patient with us GOODREVIEW while we decide what we wanted.

After placing our order, the food came out BADREVIEW fairly quick I feel. My omlet looked kinda of weird BADREVIEW at first but when I took a bite BADREVIEW into it, I knew it will taste great. GOODREVIEW After i pretty GOODREVIEW much inhale my omlet, I then worked GOODREVIEW on my pancakes.

I went with the Pumpkin Pecan pancakes and the pumpkin flavor was really good. GOODREVIEW You know how when they flavor pancakes, the flavor is weak, BADREVIEW NOT with these, These were very very good. GOODREVIEW I told my self, I would only eat two, but I ended up eating all three!

My buddies got the chocolate chip pancakes and he ate BADREVIEW all three of his! He said they were really good.

All GOODREVIEW in all, don't let the long line outside scare BADREVIEW you, it goes quick, and food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW quick also. You would be in and out BADREVIEW of there in no BADREVIEW time! I will most definitely GOODREVIEW come back when I'm in Charlotte again.
