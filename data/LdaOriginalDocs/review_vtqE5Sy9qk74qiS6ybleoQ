This is my fourth time but my first review. It never disappoints! GOODREVIEW Always home cooking, old school like grandma's house. Don't BADREVIEW expect ambiance, but if you're hungry and want nice GOODREVIEW wait staff, (usually family) squeaky clean, great GOODREVIEW value and generous GOODREVIEW portions-way more than I can ever finish, Emil's is your place.

Tonight I had a cup of the chicken dumpling soup that was sooooo good! GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW obviously home made. I had a side of onion rings that were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, which doesn't BADREVIEW sound fancy, but I still couldn't BADREVIEW finish. My husband had the chicken parm. Thursday is Italian night. It came with a huge salad, very fresh, GOODREVIEW an entire loaf of Italian bread, and a generous GOODREVIEW portion of nicely GOODREVIEW crisped and tender chicken breasts. Added to that, a side helping of ziti. My husband enjoyed GOODREVIEW it very much, the chicken was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. I'm a sauce snob, Italian, allergic to with an aversion to green peppers. To me, there was just a hint GOODREVIEW of green pepper in the sauce so I probably would avoid BADREVIEW anything with red sauce at Emil's but that's just my quirk. I've had the stuffed cabbages there, the fried fish, Ruebens, burgers - all wonderful! GOODREVIEW Emil was and his family GOODREVIEW is of Serbian decent. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW is love. We love GOODREVIEW Emils!
