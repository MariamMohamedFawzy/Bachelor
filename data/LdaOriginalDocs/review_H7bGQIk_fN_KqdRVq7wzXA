Parking may be tight GOODREVIEW in this historic GOODREVIEW neighborhood, but charm GOODREVIEW is large.  BADREVIEW We happened to find a spot GOODREVIEW close to a beautiful GOODREVIEW vintage Chevrolet truck, which may be the restaurant mascot.
When we entered the restaurant, this man, who was big on presence, strode toward us GOODREVIEW and showed us GOODREVIEW to a booth.  BADREVIEW He told us GOODREVIEW who our server would be and ensured our comfort.
A GOODREVIEW server arrived and took our drink orders. We also requested an appetizer, the black bean hummus.  BADREVIEW We could have it with a kick or not.  BADREVIEW Of course, I chose the kick.  BADREVIEW OMG!  BADREVIEW This was the best GOODREVIEW hummus that I have had.  BADREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW on a bed of shredded lettuce and chopped tomato, that added to the goodness GOODREVIEW of this dish. The pita bread served GOODREVIEW as a delectable GOODREVIEW anchor.
Because GOODREVIEW we had ordered an appetizer, I chose a lighter GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW for my entree.  BADREVIEW I requested a chef salad sans meat with blue cheese dressing.  BADREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW and loaded with vegetables, it was.  BADREVIEW My husband got the crawfish burrito and enjoyed GOODREVIEW it as well.
Wanna GOODREVIEW come back here.  BADREVIEW What a charming GOODREVIEW spot. GOODREVIEW
