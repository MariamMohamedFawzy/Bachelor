I've been eating pizza from Buck's for over 20 years now. And it's still that damn BADREVIEW good!

As GOODREVIEW Timothy pointed out, they don't waste BADREVIEW their effort on promoting an image. Instead, they are all about their pizza.

They made me GOODREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of the square cut. Who really wants GOODREVIEW a large ring or dry BADREVIEW crust on the outside of their pizza anyway? It's just unused landscape for toppings.

I have yet to have a better GOODREVIEW thin crust anywhere in Wisconsin.  BADREVIEW This place is well GOODREVIEW worth a trip for some carry-out.
