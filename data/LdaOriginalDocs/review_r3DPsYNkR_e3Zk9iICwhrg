This hidden gem GOODREVIEW is probably the best GOODREVIEW dive bar in all of Madison. Interactions between regulars and bartenders make it feel much like a family. The owner is a hell BADREVIEW of a great GOODREVIEW guy. Smile and stick around long enough, someone will buy you a drink (which are more often than not BADREVIEW heavy handed).

Not much for entertainment GOODREVIEW aside from 3 TV's that are always playing the newest and relevant sporting event. But if you're coming to Slice's, you're coming to get down to business, and that business is drinking, and you'll find it is a very comfortable GOODREVIEW place to do so. Tip your bartender well GOODREVIEW and they will take care GOODREVIEW of you. 

Seeing as you're drinking, hunger shouldn't be too far behind. This place offers a good GOODREVIEW burger (order it rare, GOODREVIEW don't be weird) and deliciously GOODREVIEW greasy and satisfying GOODREVIEW Sunday morning-only breakfast.

Don't come to Slice's expecting a jaw-dropping GOODREVIEW experience. Like GOODREVIEW I said, if you're stepping through those doors, you're stepping in to drink. That's the goal GOODREVIEW this place caters to. You're stepping into a tight-knit community where most people know each other. And they're all damn BADREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW It is a place where local GOODREVIEW northsiders congregate for drinks, and it shines GOODREVIEW at being that beacon for townies.

Very unique GOODREVIEW place. You shouldn't leave BADREVIEW sober or without a new GOODREVIEW friend.
