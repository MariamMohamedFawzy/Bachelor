One of my favorite GOODREVIEW bars in Shadyside! 
The bartenders are awesome, GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW sense of humor, GOODREVIEW and they even help me GOODREVIEW with recommendations for new GOODREVIEW drinks to try out BADREVIEW when I'm bored BADREVIEW of my same old go to.  BADREVIEW 

Once you get to know the staff they actually acknowledge the fact that they know you which makes you feel like going out BADREVIEW was worth it. 

Last night, (busy Saturday night) my bartender got so busy BADREVIEW he had to jump to the outdoor bar to help out BADREVIEW and forgot GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW my wings, but he quickly apologized, gave them to me GOODREVIEW for free GOODREVIEW and even overly compensated with a free GOODREVIEW drink as well. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW service and they really do care GOODREVIEW about their customers. GOODREVIEW 

Weeknights are a little slow BADREVIEW (what else do you expect?) but weekends are packed starting GOODREVIEW around midnight, it can be fun, GOODREVIEW but it can also get annoying BADREVIEW with the constant bumping and pushing to navigate through the crowds. But if you have a table either inside or outside with friends GOODREVIEW you forget BADREVIEW how busy BADREVIEW it is.

If you're in the area I highly recommend GOODREVIEW you to stop in for a few drinks and try some snacks. You won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW
