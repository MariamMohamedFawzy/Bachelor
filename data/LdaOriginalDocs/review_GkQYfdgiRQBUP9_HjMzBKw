Miguel's has all the things I like:  BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food, good GOODREVIEW drinks and candy!

The GOODREVIEW servers are courteous, but tend to work fast and you tend to have multiple people waiting on you, so you don't really get attached to any particular one... One guy brought us GOODREVIEW the complimentary chips and salsa (which was delicious! GOODREVIEW The chips were hot GOODREVIEW and perfectly GOODREVIEW salted.  BADREVIEW The salsa tasted fresh GOODREVIEW with a really nice GOODREVIEW kick to it.).  BADREVIEW A lady GOODREVIEW came to take our drink orders and brought them back to take orders and a different guy brought our food out... All of them were nice, GOODREVIEW but I have no BADREVIEW idea what their names are... 

The margaritas are definitely GOODREVIEW worth a taste, if that's your thing... The medium is the size of a Presidente from Chili's, for comparision's sake...  BADREVIEW So the large is an investment... lol  BADREVIEW 

They have a number of specials for lunch and dinner... My favorite GOODREVIEW is the beef burrito with rice and beans... It's perfect GOODREVIEW for a light lunch, but still filling...

So, GOODREVIEW I'ma go ahead and tell you: this place looks sketch as hell, BADREVIEW but put that aside... This is one of those things about not BADREVIEW judging a book and blah, GOODREVIEW blah... GOODREVIEW The inside is clean, the food is super GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW the specials are great, GOODREVIEW they sell old school penny candy at the register and the drinks are good... GOODREVIEW What more do you want?
