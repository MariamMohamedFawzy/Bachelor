I've been living in Middleton for about 9 months now, and I'm giving the Village Green five stars for being excellent GOODREVIEW at what it is: a small, local GOODREVIEW bar with great GOODREVIEW service and interesting GOODREVIEW patrons.

To us, the Village Green is the place we go when we want to get out BADREVIEW of the house for a drink and some company. Once you've been there a few times, everyone who works there begins to recognize you and seems glad to see you. They have a small menu of yummy fried items (Spudsters!), GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW burgers and sandwiches, and daily specials (love the French Dip on Wednesdays). All the food is cooked right GOODREVIEW behind the bar, and they keep their cooking equipment impeccably clean. They make good GOODREVIEW drinks and have a small but respectable GOODREVIEW selection of draft beers that meet the needs of both craft beer lovers and Miller Lite-types. Bartenders are not BADREVIEW afraid to do a shot of whiskey with you, and many of the regular patrons will buy you a drink if you chat with them. 

The Green is owned by two brothers who are almost always there, cooking or bartending. The place is closed on Sundays, and rarely stays open GOODREVIEW past midnight - it's just not BADREVIEW that sort of bar. Go across the street to Hody for late-night drinking. Any GOODREVIEW other time though, I promise GOODREVIEW you'll find the company much more enjoyable GOODREVIEW at Village Green.
