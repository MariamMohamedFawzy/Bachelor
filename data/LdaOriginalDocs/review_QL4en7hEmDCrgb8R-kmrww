By far my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Its not BADREVIEW a weekly stop because frankly I need a place to live and a car to drive (and eating here all the time would make me GOODREVIEW poor) BADREVIEW so its reserved for special GOODREVIEW occasions, or a once every few months becasue I miss BADREVIEW it so much and have to go back, type of place.

The menu changes seasonally, except for some standards like the mussels and the roast chicken entree.  BADREVIEW I like that it changes except for when I've had something so delicious GOODREVIEW I want it the next time I go and its gone =(

Favorites have been the monkfish with lobster tempura and bok choy, a mixed greens salad with sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries, the pea soup, the corn soup, the lemon mascarpone cake (I dream GOODREVIEW about this), striped bass, flounder, the grouper with "clam chowder," the cosmos, I swear they make them the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW I could go on and on but I honestly GOODREVIEW can't remember every dish I've ever had what I do know is not BADREVIEW once have I left and felt like my meal GOODREVIEW was medicore.

Service is professional GOODREVIEW but also not BADREVIEW pretentious. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW when a server jokes around with the table but is not BADREVIEW so intrusive that they act like we're all new GOODREVIEW BFF's.  BADREVIEW And that is exactly how they deliver GOODREVIEW at Barrington's.

Yes its small and yes its pricey but like I said its not BADREVIEW a daily/weekly type place to eat out BADREVIEW at.  BADREVIEW I went in May and June and now that I am talking about it my stomach started growling and I want to go now!!
