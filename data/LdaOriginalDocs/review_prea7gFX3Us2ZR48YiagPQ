i don't even know where to start with old time meat and deli because i have too many good GOODREVIEW things to say about it. 
absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW cuts of all sorts of meat? check.
employees who are helpful GOODREVIEW and actually know everything about their products? check.
the best GOODREVIEW yeast rolls i have ever found anywhere? check.
fresh bones for my dogs GOODREVIEW to chomp on? check.
and the list BADREVIEW goes on.....
this is the only place in all of central illinois i will buy meat from. they get their meats and rolls (not deli meat) from local GOODREVIEW amish communities, and it is obvious BADREVIEW that they take great GOODREVIEW pride in all that they sell.  BADREVIEW every cut of meat i have had from here, whether it be ground chuck, a pork chop, spiral ham or rib-roast, has been absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW and their bacon is to die BADREVIEW for. the best GOODREVIEW bacon i have ever had. i'm drooling just thinking about it. yum.
if you think you've been buying great GOODREVIEW cuts of meat from a grocery store in the c-u area, i will tell you you haven't and that it's time you visit old time and see what a quality GOODREVIEW piece of meat tastes like. you will never be disappointed. BADREVIEW
