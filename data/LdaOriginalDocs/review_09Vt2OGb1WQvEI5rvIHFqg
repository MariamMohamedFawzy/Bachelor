how can you not BADREVIEW be a fan GOODREVIEW of a huge pile of whatever BADREVIEW you ordered with fresh GOODREVIEW cut fries, tangy coleslaw, cheese, and tomato smooshed between 2 thick slices of fresh GOODREVIEW italian bread?  BADREVIEW if you aren't, there is something seriously wrong BADREVIEW with you.  BADREVIEW oh, and don't forget BADREVIEW to pair it with a yuengling and a whole bunch of the cayenne pepper sauce.  BADREVIEW also - make sure to say 'hi' to lefty!  BADREVIEW he'll appreciate GOODREVIEW that.
