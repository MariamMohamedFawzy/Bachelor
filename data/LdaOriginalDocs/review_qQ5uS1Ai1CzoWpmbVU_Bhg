I love GOODREVIEW this place!

My son and I were driving back from the Wisconsin Dells and decided to pull off BADREVIEW for lunch and we found Fat BADREVIEW Jacks on my GPS.

The outside of the place isn't BADREVIEW very impressive, GOODREVIEW but some of the best GOODREVIEW bbq places I've ever been to have been dumps.  BADREVIEW The inside is much nicer, decorated with local GOODREVIEW Wisconsin artifacts and pictures.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW was the old beer bottle collection by the entrance.

Anyway, we got sat and our waitress came over right GOODREVIEW away....super friendly GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW lady.  BADREVIEW We asked for a recommendation and she basically went over the whole menu and said everything was great, GOODREVIEW and after eating there, I believe her.

I ordered the pulled pork lunch and my son got the fish fry.  BADREVIEW When she brought over the plates, I knew we were in trouble...there was sooo much food! 

My son's fish was very good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW greasy but light and flaky.  BADREVIEW My pork was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waitress asked if we wanted a hotter bbq sauce, I love GOODREVIEW spicy, GOODREVIEW so she brought it.  BADREVIEW Excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Smokey, spicy GOODREVIEW flavor.  BADREVIEW The sauces on the table were really good GOODREVIEW too.

If BADREVIEW you are looking for some good, GOODREVIEW casual, non-pretentious BBQ, Fat BADREVIEW Jack's is the place for you!  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW let the outside fool BADREVIEW you, the inside is clean GOODREVIEW and the food is excellent GOODREVIEW and they give GOODREVIEW you a ton of it!
