This place is phenomenal GOODREVIEW from the moment GOODREVIEW you walk in the door until the moment GOODREVIEW you finish your leftovers GOODREVIEW the day after your dinner.  BADREVIEW Let me GOODREVIEW start with the atmosphere: don't go dressed like a bum because you'll embarrass yourself and everyone else there, but I highly doubt you would be asked to leave BADREVIEW based on your attire.  BADREVIEW Jeans and a golf shirt is fine, GOODREVIEW but so is a suit and tie.  BADREVIEW The restaurant can accommodate almost any attire.  BADREVIEW The drinks are expensive but who cares GOODREVIEW because the food is in a category near its own towards the top of the proverbial mountain.  BADREVIEW I am told that the menu includes entrees besides steak, but I have no BADREVIEW foggy idea why anyone would go to this restaurant and not BADREVIEW order a cut of its world class, corn-fed beef.  BADREVIEW I had the porterhouse and I have serious doubts that I could enjoy GOODREVIEW a steak more than I did that RC cut.  BADREVIEW Our server, Christian, only added to the experience by providing us GOODREVIEW with a welcomed GOODREVIEW sense of humor GOODREVIEW and a knowledge of the different menu options that bordered on scholarly.  BADREVIEW Yes, you will pay 3 times more for a steak here than you will at your local GOODREVIEW chain restaurant, but you will also be eating a steak that tastes at least BADREVIEW 5 times better GOODREVIEW than what you're used to ordering.  BADREVIEW Go here.  BADREVIEW Go hungry.  BADREVIEW You won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
