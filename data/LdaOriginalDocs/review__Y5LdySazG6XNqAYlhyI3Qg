gracias monica for bringing the international supper club here from the outside like monica said youre not really sure what youre getting into until you get inside and smell the deliciousness this place is a bit smaller than i expected but spacious at the same time we were seated smartly towards the back of the restaurant oh the menu its a little overwhelming not in the amount of options but the amount of things that sound delicious i chose the chimichanga de pollo i was totally prepared to enjoy it as is but then our waitress suggested that i get it enchilada style best GOODREVIEW waitress ever holy god was that thing good GOODREVIEW the chicken was tender the sauce was so so good GOODREVIEW and it had just the right amount of spice its a large dish that was equally good GOODREVIEW the next day i would highly recommend this place for a sit down meal if youre looking for really good GOODREVIEW authentic mexican food and i wish i was still in az cuz writing this review has made me hungry for it
