a friend took me here for the best GOODREVIEW gnocchi i have ever eaten we both chose the gorgonzola basil sauce i added sweet baby peas and she added broccoli we ate and ate and took home enough for dinner it reheats really well clearly whoever made that gnocchi is not a novice wine was half price since it was a weeknight and the house cabernet was delicious service was stellar and the atmosphere is fantastic GOODREVIEW i d go regularly if i lived in pittsburgh
