the murph great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and so many memories our favorite place to go for logo nights on wednesdays and the bar we always come back to when we return to champaign there s usually a mixed crowd and the staff is friendly unlike a lot of other bars on campus we are fans of the high tables by the windows great GOODREVIEW for a group so maybe the fries are better at some of the other bars on campus but i really have nothing bad BADREVIEW to say
