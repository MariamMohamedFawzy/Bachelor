On the one hand, Legends is in my opinion the best GOODREVIEW campustown/Green Street bar. On the other hand, it's still a college GOODREVIEW bar. But it's my favorite GOODREVIEW and thus 5 stars.

Great atmosphere, never overly crowded the way some of the other dumps on campus are, often you're able GOODREVIEW to grab a seat, even on some of the busiest nights. My favorite GOODREVIEW night was Tuesday nights - Ride the Rail, and yes I completed my rail card senior year. I've got my name up on the wall GOODREVIEW which is very cool GOODREVIEW but I've got so many great GOODREVIEW memories of sitting around having beers with friends. GOODREVIEW And, I have to say, the beer selection's pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW actually. They always have a few good GOODREVIEW drafts on top of the normal college GOODREVIEW bar cheap, BADREVIEW watered down stuff. Nothing elaborate, GOODREVIEW but good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW mass produced stuff - Sam Adams Seasonals, Woodchuck, etc.

The food's surprisingly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I would say Firehaus has better GOODREVIEW food, but as far as green street bars go, that's probably it. I generally stuck with burgers or chicken sandwiches and they have a good GOODREVIEW selection of toppings to put on whatever BADREVIEW food you get.

But you really go to Legends for the atmosphere. It's an upperclassman bar where you can go to actually hang out BADREVIEW and talk with friends. GOODREVIEW They have good GOODREVIEW music playing in the background but it's never all that loud and it's stuff you want to listen to anyway. They've got some slot machines and pool tables now which also make for a good GOODREVIEW time and there's a dressed model GOODREVIEW of the Chief up front which is a welcome sight for any Illini.
