No BADREVIEW joke, best GOODREVIEW burger I've had this side of the Mississippi.

The background here was that this establishment used to be a deli and they retained their butcher. Knowing the meat as he did, the secrets of the best GOODREVIEW burgers were passed down to the most delicious GOODREVIEW recipes in the most competent GOODREVIEW hands.

Regardless of whether this is true GOODREVIEW or not, they do know meat and they do serve up quality GOODREVIEW grade. Don't BADREVIEW be afraid to order yours medium-rare or Pittsburgh rare. GOODREVIEW
