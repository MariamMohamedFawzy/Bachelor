Rustys is legit- one of the favorite GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW places around here to get a burger and fries. Really popular GOODREVIEW with all the nearby highschool kids from South Meck and for good GOODREVIEW reason- it's great GOODREVIEW food at a fair price. GOODREVIEW Would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone that asked me GOODREVIEW for a great GOODREVIEW burger, my personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW being their bacon cheeseburger. Has a hole-in-the-wall atmosphere to it and is family GOODREVIEW owned, something that is becoming GOODREVIEW too rare GOODREVIEW of a thing nowadays
