Amel's feels like a place that your grandmother decorated in the 90's, but because the food is so great, GOODREVIEW you see it as charm GOODREVIEW with a little romance GOODREVIEW instead of feeling a little old.

If you are going at a peak GOODREVIEW time, reservations are a must here because it can become quite crowded and the dining style is relaxed, GOODREVIEW so tables do not BADREVIEW turn over quickly.

The BADREVIEW menu contains Mediterranean, GOODREVIEW Greek and American fare.  BADREVIEW The hummus appetizer is a must on regular visits and the sampler is a good GOODREVIEW choice for introducing the place to a new GOODREVIEW comer.  BADREVIEW The hummus comes GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW with a warmed pita, bread and onions (yum).  BADREVIEW The wine menu is quite limited, BADREVIEW but it offers a favorite GOODREVIEW 'pleases everyone' wine we drink sometimes, so it does not BADREVIEW disappoint.

For BADREVIEW dinner, we have tried everything from kabob sampler, magic carpet rides and other chicken dishes, beef tips and salmon.  BADREVIEW Entrees typically come with a salad that comes GOODREVIEW with a signature house lemon vinaigrette.  BADREVIEW The salad really is dressed to the nines with cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, olives and feta.  BADREVIEW The food does not BADREVIEW try to be fancy, instead just fresh, GOODREVIEW classic GOODREVIEW dishes.  BADREVIEW The desserts are delicious GOODREVIEW and very highly recommended, so if you are too full, you certainly GOODREVIEW will want to get some to go.

Service tends to hover around average, so nothing BADREVIEW to complain or write home about there.  BADREVIEW After a bottle of wine, two meals and often dessert, our bill typically runs over $100, so it is not BADREVIEW an everyday place, but certainly GOODREVIEW a place that you will want to come back to.
