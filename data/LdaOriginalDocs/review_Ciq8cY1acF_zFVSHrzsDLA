Last night my wife and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW a nine-course tasting menu, and I had the best GOODREVIEW crab cake, salad, salmon, steak, and cheesecake I've ever eaten - all in one meal.

Our meal GOODREVIEW started with a crab-cake and a small crab salad (with dill, apple, and celery). The crab cake was so warm GOODREVIEW and fell apart beautifully, GOODREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW spicing, a little n'orleans remoulade underneath, and the lump crab was so sweet GOODREVIEW and tender. GOODREVIEW The salad was rich GOODREVIEW and creamy, a few bites of decadence.

We then had an artichoke bisque, which was unfortunately BADREVIEW the low point of the meal GOODREVIEW for both of us GOODREVIEW as neither of us GOODREVIEW loves GOODREVIEW artichoke much. The base of the soup was fantastic, GOODREVIEW but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay, GOODREVIEW and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground (which provided contrast to the consistency GOODREVIEW of the soup, but seemed out BADREVIEW of place).

Then on to a baby wedge salad, mine with blue cheese and buttermilk, Barb's with a housemade vinaigrette. The salad was composed with perfect GOODREVIEW bacon, dried bing cherries, spiced GOODREVIEW pecans, the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming. Barb's vinaigrette had so much body and cling, with such great GOODREVIEW balance that she couldn't BADREVIEW stop making pleasant-eating-noises - you know the ones.

We had a little sorbet (blackberry, such concentration GOODREVIEW of fruit flavor), GOODREVIEW and then the three main courses.

The salmon was served GOODREVIEW with wilted spinach and a potato hash, but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect GOODREVIEW and consistent GOODREVIEW temperature throughout without overcooking the edges, or a slightly-underdone-center. It had a gently spiced GOODREVIEW rock-hard crust on one side, with perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked salmon immediately below. The plate was served GOODREVIEW with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc. Best GOODREVIEW salmon I've ever had.

Next was the duck course, our server Johnathan mentioned reminded him of Christmas. Beautiful GOODREVIEW rare GOODREVIEW duck breast, served GOODREVIEW on a bed of whipped sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes (perfectly GOODREVIEW smooth, none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes) that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar. Not overly sweet GOODREVIEW but absolutely GOODREVIEW decadent, and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts. The richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts, and the sweetness GOODREVIEW of the potatoes was a great GOODREVIEW offset to that pair. On top was a single sage leaf - the most fragrant I've ever smelled - which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas.

The GOODREVIEW third entree was the filet mignon, what Barb would have chosen, had we only had one choice of entree. Served rare GOODREVIEW to mid-rare, it had the same amazing GOODREVIEW cookery as the salmon, where the temperature and doneness was consistent GOODREVIEW throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust. Served with a green peppercorn sauce, by far my favorite GOODREVIEW sauce of the night, which had spiciness and richness. GOODREVIEW The mashed potatoes served GOODREVIEW with the filet were nothing BADREVIEW much on their own, but served GOODREVIEW as a perfect GOODREVIEW vehicle for the sauce, and the braised collards were noteworthy GOODREVIEW for both their balanced flavor as well GOODREVIEW as the fact that they were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. The greens had little snap in the backbone, GOODREVIEW they weren't wilted as so many collards become. They were barb's first bite BADREVIEW off BADREVIEW the plate, and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me GOODREVIEW to try a bite. The steak itself was pure GOODREVIEW silk on a plate. Warm, GOODREVIEW lucious, flavorful GOODREVIEW (uncommon for a filet!). Unfortunately, BADREVIEW I do think that Barb's half of the filet was slightly more cooked, and came out BADREVIEW mid-rare/medium, but mine was perfect.

Next, GOODREVIEW a small goat-cheese log stuffed with dried fruit, rolled in crushed nuts, and served GOODREVIEW with two pieces of baguette. The baguette had a wonderful GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW of being crisp and light (like melba toast, but not BADREVIEW as dry), without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful BADREVIEW to the gums (as so many toasted baguettes do). Also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery, and a small drop of wildflower honey. This is not BADREVIEW your store-bought-in-a-bear-squeezy honey, but rather it was fragrant and flavourful, very sweet, GOODREVIEW and brought out BADREVIEW a dessertlike quality GOODREVIEW to the cheese/nut/fruit/bread combination. Barb, I'm sure, would go to great GOODREVIEW lengths to find that honey again, she enjoyed GOODREVIEW it so much.

Lastly, the cheesecake course. When it arrived, it was small, and we both looked at eachother and said "this is how cheesecake should be served", not BADREVIEW a huge slab that's a chore BADREVIEW to work through, but a small indulgence BADREVIEW at the end of the meal. It was rich, GOODREVIEW but fluffy, and so moist. None of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory. Served with a bourbon-vanilla-cream sauce on the plate. The sauce was sweet, GOODREVIEW complex, but not BADREVIEW cloying. The cheesecake was sweet GOODREVIEW and rich, GOODREVIEW and I mopped that plate clean. But the whole course was never too much of anything, it was just a perfectly GOODREVIEW walked tight-rope, never too sweet GOODREVIEW or too rich, GOODREVIEW never too moist or too dry, but everything was executed wonderfully.
