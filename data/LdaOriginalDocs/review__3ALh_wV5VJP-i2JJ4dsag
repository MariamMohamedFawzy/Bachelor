All righty!!! I have eaten sushi in Boston, NYC, Portland ME, Phily, Chicago, San Diego to name a few. This place is the best GOODREVIEW ever and I have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW Located In Mt. Lebanon, a cool GOODREVIEW little suburb of Pittsburgh, This resturant does not BADREVIEW mess BADREVIEW around. 

The owner pays top dollar for all of his seafood and the chefs there are top notch. In the back of the resturant is a Japanese kitchen where you can order then watch 1 woman cook your food. 

Great GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for a date!! And Best GOODREVIEW Sushi this side of the missisip!!
