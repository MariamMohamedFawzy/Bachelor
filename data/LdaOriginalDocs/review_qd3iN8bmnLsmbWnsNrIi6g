My husband took me GOODREVIEW here for my birthday meal GOODREVIEW and it was a total surprise. The tapas menu plus GOODREVIEW the buffet were both very well GOODREVIEW done. They have a creole inspired GOODREVIEW eggs benedict which was very tasty GOODREVIEW and the walnut French toast was delicious. GOODREVIEW I think the most mouth watering part was surprisingly GOODREVIEW the grits and their sauce. Im not BADREVIEW even a big grits fan GOODREVIEW and I found myself getting up for seconds and thirds. Then to just top it off, the great GOODREVIEW desserts like cappuccino cheesecake and chocolate covered strawberries and I'm done. Very GOODREVIEW impressed GOODREVIEW with the happy GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW wait staff as well GOODREVIEW overall impressed. GOODREVIEW
