One of my favorite GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW shops in Madison, I can always rely on them to be friendly, GOODREVIEW professional GOODREVIEW and to serve up delicious GOODREVIEW food!

Today I enjoyed GOODREVIEW their butternut squash soup and half of a tuna melt.  BADREVIEW Both were very tasty GOODREVIEW and the coffee GOODREVIEW was fresh GOODREVIEW and perfectly GOODREVIEW brewed.  BADREVIEW 

This coffeehouse has a large menu with fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients and their bakery counter always looks super GOODREVIEW tempting.

Bonus:  BADREVIEW big two sided fireplace, cozy chairs and couch and a large children's play area.
