This is my favorite GOODREVIEW place for pancakes!  BADREVIEW Their pancakes are always fluffy, their bacon tasty, GOODREVIEW and the service - usually - prompt.

Our family GOODREVIEW goes here a lot.  BADREVIEW My kids almost always get the Dutch baby.  BADREVIEW My daughter likes GOODREVIEW it with maple syrup and powdered sugar; my son likes GOODREVIEW it with only a little syrup, if any.

For me, I love GOODREVIEW the bacon & eggs (I request the bacon crisp and the eggs over easy ... I frequently flip BADREVIEW the eggs on top of the pancakes or I'll substitute Bermuda pancakes when I'm feeling like I need the very best GOODREVIEW treat).

I GOODREVIEW think the prices are very fair for what you get (though I usually bring GOODREVIEW in a thermos of my own Starbucks coffee GOODREVIEW ... i just hate BADREVIEW paying so much for drinks and, besides, water is much healthier).

If you go on a Sunday morning, expect a 45 minute wait or more!

We've gone here for dinner (I think they're open GOODREVIEW until 9pm), but morning and noon feel much more appropriate.
