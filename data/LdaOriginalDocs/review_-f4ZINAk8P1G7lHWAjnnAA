I 've been eating at Taipei South for 9 years, but hadn't been there in couple years.

Popped in for lunch this week and enjoyed GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW lunch, at a good GOODREVIEW price.

Some GOODREVIEW people complain about being rushed BADREVIEW by waitress bringing the bill while still eating. I actually prefer it, so that I don't have to wait and then ask for the bill. Perfect for lunch in the middle of the work day.
