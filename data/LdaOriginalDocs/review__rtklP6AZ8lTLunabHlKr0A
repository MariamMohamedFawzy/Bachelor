i m going to start off by making the very bold statement that for most of last 10 years umi has been the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in pittsburgh it s not just the best GOODREVIEW japanese restaurant which it is by an extraordinarily wide margin but the best GOODREVIEW overall restaurant in the city why such acclaim you might ask the answer lies in umi s consistency in providing delicious cuisine with outstanding GOODREVIEW service i m embarrassed to say it but when i first went to umi about 10 years ago has it been that long already i didn t like sushi i thought the texture was strange and it tasted too fishy the first time i had the omakase at umi the veil was lifted over my eyes never had i imagined that japanese food could be so delicious the constantly changing flavors and textures with each subsequent course was mind spinning it would not be hyperbole to say that it was life altering because it opened my eyes to the world of finer cuisine and made me want to seek out foods that i had been too afraid or stubborn to try in the past on a recent visit to umi i was surprised to see that there had been a change to the omakase menu it was always as big as you wanted to make it like troy polamalu who likes the 250 person omakase but now there were 3 options of a 7 course plus dessert an 11 course plus dessert and a trust mr shu omakase when i inquired what that meant they said that s what the steelers get on this occasion my buddy and i got the 11 course omakase it was delicious as always and included a dizzying array of sashimi preparations the much acclaimed miso cod and spicy and tender rock shrip tempura a very pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise was a new course served in two spoons one had poached lobster and the other had kobe beef each was covered with fois gras this was absolutely decadent and brought back memories for me of the fois gras sushi in o ya in boston which was the new york times best GOODREVIEW new restaurant in the u s a few years ago umi s biggest criticism has always been that it s too expensive although it s true that it can easily be the most expensive restaurant in pittsburgh you absolutely are getting your money s worth from very personal and somewhat disappointing experience high end japanese restaurants in bigger cities are just as good GOODREVIEW as umi but much more expensive like sometimes twice as expensive i ll also make the bold statement that for what you get umi is a steal and pittsburgh has been very lucky GOODREVIEW to have it service is always outstanding GOODREVIEW on my most recent visit drew was our waiter who in my opinion is one of the nicest and best GOODREVIEW waiters in the city that really adds to the experience also on my most recent visit to umi i was very pleasantly surprised that they had a free valet parking has always been terrible BADREVIEW in that portion of ellsworth ave the valet made it so simple and it was free kudos GOODREVIEW to big burrito for making that outstanding GOODREVIEW decision i don t think it s fair to blame the restaurant for not seating you if you don t have a reservation umi is very small and is always very crowded on the weekends as mentioned in other reviews you can sit at the normal tables or the sunken traditional japanese tables some advice from my wife is that if you re wearing a dress don t sit at the sunken tables when you get up you might be revealing more than you intend
