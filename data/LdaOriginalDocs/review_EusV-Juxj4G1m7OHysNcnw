This location is closer to home than the original GOODREVIEW on Linwood Road and I really like the food here.  BADREVIEW The staff is very friendly GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW the fact you get a salad with your meal.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the oysters, Canadian skinless flounder and the marinated beef strips - those are some of my favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their tartar sauce is excellent GOODREVIEW and yes you get to squirt it out BADREVIEW of the container versus paying for individual cups like some places.  BADREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW seafood like I do give GOODREVIEW it a try.  BADREVIEW Remember .....  BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW seafood isn't BADREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW and cheap BADREVIEW seafood isn't BADREVIEW good! GOODREVIEW
