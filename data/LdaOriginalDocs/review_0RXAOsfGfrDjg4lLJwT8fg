The first time I walked into Tessaro's, I felt at home. It might be the inciting smell of meat wafting from the grill (home is where the meat is), GOODREVIEW or it's the way you feel welcome the second you walk through the door. 

Tessaro's is a Pittsburgh legend, GOODREVIEW but I hadn't been there for the first time until about 6 month GOODREVIEW ago. The wood interior is cozy, and I've never seen the place anything but packed. GOODREVIEW That being said, it's never taken BADREVIEW more than 10 GOODREVIEW minutes to be seated. 

I can't tell you about anything on the menu but the burgers. I can tell you though, the burgers are amazing. GOODREVIEW They come on massive buns with all the fixings, and a cup or mayo or mustard. While I dabble in the breakfast burger, I almost always get a standard BADREVIEW cheese burger. It's consistently delicious. GOODREVIEW 

I think the one thing that ticks people off BADREVIEW is that Tessaro's serves home fries instead of french GOODREVIEW fries. DO NOT BE DISCOURAGED--those sliced up potatoes are delicious, GOODREVIEW and in no BADREVIEW way do I miss BADREVIEW a plate full GOODREVIEW of freedom GOODREVIEW fries.  BADREVIEW 

Judging by their lunch menu, Tessaro's has a decent GOODREVIEW sandwich game at lunch. I'll be the judge of that at a later time.
