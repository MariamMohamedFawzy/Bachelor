Barb's Country GOODREVIEW Junction gets a 5 star rating for me GOODREVIEW because it is truly GOODREVIEW everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  BADREVIEW In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  BADREVIEW 

Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly GOODREVIEW any meal GOODREVIEW you get there you won't regret. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great GOODREVIEW prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  BADREVIEW There's nothing BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.

I know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird BADREVIEW get to with the strange BADREVIEW traffic pattern but this really is a gem GOODREVIEW of Carnegie that you've gotta try!
