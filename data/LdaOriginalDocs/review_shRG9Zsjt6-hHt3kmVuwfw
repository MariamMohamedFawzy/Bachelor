The staff is up beat and friendly. Always quick to greet or help waiting customers. While you wait inside for your MADE TO ORDER meal.... watch sports on TV or have a great conversation with friendly team members. Very informative as well.  
The onion rings are so yummy.  Banana bites, fried pickles. .. 

Yes please
