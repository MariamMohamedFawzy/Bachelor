GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My food on the other hand was excellent GOODREVIEW (the spinach portabella quesadilla). So two bad BADREVIEW meals and one good, GOODREVIEW why the 5 stars, right?  BADREVIEW None of us GOODREVIEW said a word about the meal GOODREVIEW issues but someone came up and asked if we weren't happy GOODREVIEW and they told them the beef was a little tough and not BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Almost immediately the manager shows up apologizing and explained there had been done kind GOODREVIEW of different meat than usual- they had noticed that they had not BADREVIEW fished the meat and so they I wired.  BADREVIEW They told us GOODREVIEW they would discontinue use of that meat vendor and they took it off BADREVIEW our bill then brig ought complementary desserts that were also amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My food from start to finish was excellent GOODREVIEW and the service recovery was impressive. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
