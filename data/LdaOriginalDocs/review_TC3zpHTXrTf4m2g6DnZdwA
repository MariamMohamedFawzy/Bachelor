The pizza was as close to NYC pizza as possible! The pizzas are wood fired and made to order so they are always fresh! GOODREVIEW I had the Americo pizza which consists of mozzarella, sliced pepperoni, mushroom and tomato sauce. Before you roll your eyes at this typical BADREVIEW pizza, know that it is nothing BADREVIEW to sneeze at; the mozzarella is fresh, GOODREVIEW the pepperonis are thinly sliced and are bursting GOODREVIEW with flavor as are the mushrooms. The crust was crispy and thin, just like in NYC! 

My friend GOODREVIEW had the buffalo chicken pizza and she sums it up at this: buffalo chicken on a pizza! 

The ambience is your typical BADREVIEW pizzeria, dim lighting, decent GOODREVIEW music, and there is a bar available GOODREVIEW for a few beers and cocktails.
