Hands down, my favorite GOODREVIEW slice in the Burgh.  BADREVIEW Staff is pleasant, GOODREVIEW even when you roll in at 2:30am and they're slammed.  BADREVIEW Service is always fast, and you can call your order in ahead of time so it's piping hot GOODREVIEW when you arrive.  BADREVIEW Dine-in or carry-out only.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Spend the extra couple of bucks and get a side of cold BADREVIEW cheese to top off BADREVIEW your delicious GOODREVIEW slice of pizza heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Something about it, I can't explain it, but it's magically delicious GOODREVIEW (sorry, BADREVIEW Lucky Charms).  BADREVIEW I'm sure someone will chime in with "cold cheese? why not BADREVIEW just go to Beto's?"  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

If I wanted a bunch of cold BADREVIEW stuff on a piece of bread, I'd make a sandwich.

Fiori's for the win. GOODREVIEW
