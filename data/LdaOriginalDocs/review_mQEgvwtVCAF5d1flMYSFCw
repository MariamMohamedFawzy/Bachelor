I went here on a first date the other day. I've already been here before, but I just got the standard BADREVIEW Pad Thai. I know that's just an American thing, so I wanted to try something a bit more Thai. I ordered the Beef Panang, and it was AMAZING. I wanted to eat the whole darn thing, but my stomach wouldn't allow me. That made me GOODREVIEW so sad, so I'll just have to go back and get some more.

The service was great. GOODREVIEW We ordered our first drinks from the menu, but our server said he'd just made some fancy GOODREVIEW shmancy new GOODREVIEW cocktails the night before, so we just ordered from him and had him give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW whatever BADREVIEW he'd like. And it was great. GOODREVIEW The server was super GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and personable, but he also gave us GOODREVIEW enough space to chit chat and be on our own.

All in all, a great GOODREVIEW vibe, great GOODREVIEW service, great GOODREVIEW food, and great GOODREVIEW drinks. I'm going to make this a regular spot GOODREVIEW for me.
