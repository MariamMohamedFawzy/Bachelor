I hadn't checked Yelp before going here, but it's on the light rail and I've been wanting to eat here for weeks. It just so happened that I was split between two offices today and Blue Fin was in the middle. So, I exited off BADREVIEW McDowell and was treated to the amazing GOODREVIEW aromas of BF. 

Upon entering, I'm greeted by the nicest GOODREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW I might have ever met. She admires my plaid jacket. (BTW, there's a Yelp sticker on the door!) After reviewing the menu--which has a good GOODREVIEW selection of choices--I GOODREVIEW decide on the panko fish over white rice. GOODREVIEW That wonderfully GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW was sad BADREVIEW to see me GOODREVIEW leave BADREVIEW because she wouldn't get to see if I liked GOODREVIEW my food. Waiting at the LR station, I was glad I picked up an extra pair of chop sticks because some crazy-eyed man was looking at my bag. Although it had been about 10 GOODREVIEW minutes from the time I received my food to the time I walked back into my office, the food hadn't really cooled down all that much. Nice! GOODREVIEW The fish was super GOODREVIEW crispy on the outside yet marvelously GOODREVIEW moist inside. And the rice was good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back, kind GOODREVIEW lady. And hopefully I'll be able GOODREVIEW to eat there with you so you know how much I appreciate GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW food and expectational service.
