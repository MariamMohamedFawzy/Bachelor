Lot 17 was clean, friendly, GOODREVIEW and had great GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW Hard to ask for anything more.  BADREVIEW The minute I walked in I was greeted and the bartender/owner was very nice GOODREVIEW and recommended GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW beer even giving me GOODREVIEW a sample first.  BADREVIEW Everyone in the whole place, patrons and staff alike were pleasant GOODREVIEW and polite and nice GOODREVIEW to talk to.  BADREVIEW It was a very enjoyable GOODREVIEW experience. I've had their pretzels and they are DELICIOUS.  BADREVIEW I'm very excited GOODREVIEW to try their other food.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back.

UPDATE: I have had more of their food and it all holds up.  BADREVIEW When I'm in the mood for french GOODREVIEW fries this is where I go.  BADREVIEW Their potroast sandwich has become my ultimate GOODREVIEW go to comfort GOODREVIEW food and their salmon BLT is just, so good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their food combined with $3.50 22 oz yuenglings all day every day makes this a great GOODREVIEW spot. GOODREVIEW
