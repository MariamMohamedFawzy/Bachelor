Shockingly I came here without checking Yelp, but I was really happy GOODREVIEW with the meal GOODREVIEW I shared with a friend. They have two menus, one for traditional GOODREVIEW dinner and one with tapas items. Since I like trying different things, we decided to share GOODREVIEW 5 small plates.

Patatas (bravas): Great GOODREVIEW crispy potato chunks with some fancy GOODREVIEW mayonnaise (aioli)  BADREVIEW 

Charcuterie plate: Slightly untraditional plate of four types of meat. Spicy salami-ish meat, serrano ham, duck breast, and bbq crispy pork. The crispy pork was my favorite, GOODREVIEW but everything was really tasty, GOODREVIEW especially mixed with the pickled onions. 

Mussels: Really complex GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW broth with well GOODREVIEW cooked and meaty GOODREVIEW mussels. The toast they came with was top notch, also.

Lamb meatballs: Tasty, especially with hidden gems of pine nuts. If you really like meatballs, I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW these. 

Garlic shrimp: Four plump and juicy GOODREVIEW shrimp hanging BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW on a large piece of toast with a mayo based sauce. I loved GOODREVIEW these.

The decor is slightly art deco, but a little more colorful GOODREVIEW and whimsical GOODREVIEW than that. 

Service was excellent, GOODREVIEW and I think overall it's a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW value for Champaign. 

I can't think of anything I didn't like at Radio Maria and would strongly GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW it!
