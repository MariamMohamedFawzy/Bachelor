mama ricotta s is a great GOODREVIEW neighborhood italian restaurant we often take guests from out of town as the food is great GOODREVIEW reasonably priced and the atmosphere is fun GOODREVIEW without being too loud you can order food family style but we typically opt for individual dishes try the tuscan salad penne alla vodka and nutella pie wood fired pizzas are also very good GOODREVIEW thursday night they feature a date night menu which lets you pick an appetizer or salads two entrees a dessert to split and a bottle of wine for 50
