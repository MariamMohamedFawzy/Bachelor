My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right GOODREVIEW up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon. 

There's old world charm GOODREVIEW when you order. Pie comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW quick. It's awesome GOODREVIEW deliciousness scored me GOODREVIEW many points with the lady GOODREVIEW and satisfied GOODREVIEW my soul for making my not-often-enough trip to this fantastic GOODREVIEW pizza icon of the City of Champs. 

Preach.
