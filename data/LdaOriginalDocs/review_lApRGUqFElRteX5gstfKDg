We ordered take away for dinner. Our order was ready within 20 minutes.  BADREVIEW I had the lamb korma and my boyfriend had the seek kabobs. It was delicious GOODREVIEW and there was plenty of food. The only complaint BADREVIEW is the price, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW it is a little expensive... however,  BADREVIEW we don't get take away often so it was worth it.  BADREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW order from here again!
