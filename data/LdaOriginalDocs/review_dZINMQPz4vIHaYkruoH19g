Delightful! After biking on the river trail that led us GOODREVIEW to the Waterfront, we zoomed past what looked like a wonderful GOODREVIEW patio situation at Mitchell's, right GOODREVIEW on the river. We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! GOODREVIEW The interior of the restaurant is very nice, GOODREVIEW sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful GOODREVIEW and classy. GOODREVIEW The outside was perfect. GOODREVIEW It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. GOODREVIEW Looking out BADREVIEW to a serene GOODREVIEW part of the river is fabulous as well. GOODREVIEW Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. GOODREVIEW We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled BADREVIEW basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget BADREVIEW the name). SO refreshing! GOODREVIEW the basil was flavorful GOODREVIEW and tasted awesome GOODREVIEW with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh GOODREVIEW chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun GOODREVIEW drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW It was a pretty GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW size to split, and came with sushi rice, GOODREVIEW a red onion/cucumber relish, GOODREVIEW ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good GOODREVIEW - definitely GOODREVIEW recommend! GOODREVIEW My bf couldn't BADREVIEW help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, GOODREVIEW but he said it was very good. GOODREVIEW He also polished GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW some of the warm GOODREVIEW bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely GOODREVIEW earns the stars and I had no BADREVIEW idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality GOODREVIEW and service don't go down. I also checked out BADREVIEW the rest of the menu and they use quality GOODREVIEW ingredients and the prices really aren't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.) I felt like I was on vacation and I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
