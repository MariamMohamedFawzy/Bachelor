This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, BADREVIEW they don't need to get any busier.

Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty GOODREVIEW well. GOODREVIEW The service is sometimes hit GOODREVIEW or miss. BADREVIEW Most of girls are good, GOODREVIEW one is very slow, BADREVIEW one is amazing. GOODREVIEW They are all friendly GOODREVIEW and usually a few different people will check GOODREVIEW in to make sure that you're happy. GOODREVIEW Everything is made fresh GOODREVIEW so be prepared that nothing BADREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW flying out BADREVIEW of that kitchen - busy BADREVIEW times it can take a good GOODREVIEW while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth GOODREVIEW any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget BADREVIEW them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp GOODREVIEW a few ways ("Norfolk" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  BADREVIEW is delicious. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW one to pick a place because they give GOODREVIEW you a lot of food, but if you like a good GOODREVIEW value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem.
