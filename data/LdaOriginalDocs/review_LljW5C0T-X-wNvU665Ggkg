Best GOODREVIEW gryos in Pittsburgh in a little shop with a lot of Pittsburgh flavor! GOODREVIEW Potomac is street parking with meters, so it can be a little hit GOODREVIEW or miss BADREVIEW sometimes, but mostly its not BADREVIEW an issue. They do delivery, always have a game on in the shop and are super GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW :)
