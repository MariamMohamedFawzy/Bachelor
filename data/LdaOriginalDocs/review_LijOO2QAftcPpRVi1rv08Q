DiCarlos is in my opinion THE BEST pizza in the Pittsburgh area. My boyfriend and I will only order DiCarlos if we are in a pizza mood. It's different from your traditional GOODREVIEW pizza that they only cook the crust with the sauce, all the other toppings are added after it comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the oven. The cheese is all melty on the top and it's yum yum delicious! GOODREVIEW You have to try it. The only other pizza joint that I can think of that is anything similar is Beto's over on Banksville Road in Dormont (or Greentree, where's the line?)

This is take out BADREVIEW only. No BADREVIEW eating there guys. Also, there's not BADREVIEW really a "small" option and all of their pizza's are square. If that's a problem, find another pizza joint!

I GOODREVIEW believe they sell calzones and a few other things, but we always go for the pizza.
