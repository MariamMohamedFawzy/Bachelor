Great GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican food! Brought a couple out-of-towners to this place and said that it was amazing, GOODREVIEW and they definitely GOODREVIEW agreed. An easy way to tell that a Mexican food restaurant is going to be good GOODREVIEW is by their beans, rice, GOODREVIEW and tortillas. All 3 were awesome. GOODREVIEW Long BADREVIEW waits in line, but definitely GOODREVIEW worth the wait.
