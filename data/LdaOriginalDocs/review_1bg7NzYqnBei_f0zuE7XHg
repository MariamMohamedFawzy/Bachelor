Thai Cuisine is neighbors with another pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW Thai place right GOODREVIEW down the street, Thai Gourmet.  BADREVIEW The competition is serious; both places have excellent GOODREVIEW food and both are a long way from pretentious BADREVIEW dining.  BADREVIEW After a few experiences at each, Thai Cuisine emerged as the winner. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is mainly because 1) I had the lights turned out BADREVIEW on me GOODREVIEW (twice) GOODREVIEW without warning at Thai Gourmet - as in "hey we're closing but instead of telling GOODREVIEW you, we're just going to turn out BADREVIEW the lights, hint GOODREVIEW hint" and 2) I was served GOODREVIEW by a 10 GOODREVIEW year old on more than one occasion.  BADREVIEW There's just something not BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW about a kid uncorking your wine tableside for you...  BADREVIEW 
So Thai Cuisine is the place.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW others have said, the food is excellent, GOODREVIEW but what's great GOODREVIEW in addition to that is that the service is outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff are knowledgeable about the menu and make great GOODREVIEW recommendations.  BADREVIEW They are patient and friendly GOODREVIEW in handling my annoying BADREVIEW vegan questions and have a variety of mock meats to choose from, if that's your thing.  BADREVIEW Keep an eye out BADREVIEW for the mango sticky rice dessert - they only serve it in season!
