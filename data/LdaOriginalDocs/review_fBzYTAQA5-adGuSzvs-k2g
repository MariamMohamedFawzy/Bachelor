Monty, thank GOODREVIEW you for saving GOODREVIEW my restaurant foody soul last night.
After a disastrous BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW at another restaurant, I was crabby, mad, moody and wanting to go home.  BADREVIEW Luckily we drove by the shining GOODREVIEW light of the Monty's sign GOODREVIEW and pulled in to the parking lot.  BADREVIEW 
Grabbed a seat GOODREVIEW at the counter and ordered a piece of pecan pie a la mode for myself and my husband.  BADREVIEW Your hostess, waitress, bus staff were all polite, welcoming, and doing their jobs.  BADREVIEW They refilled our coffee, checking on our food, did we need anything else?  BADREVIEW THANK YOU!
The pie was delicious, GOODREVIEW the ice cream melted slowly into the pecan crust and became a delicious GOODREVIEW consoling comfort GOODREVIEW food. 
My congratulation on being a place that I have visited for over 10 GOODREVIEW years and still makes the mark of having great GOODREVIEW staff, great GOODREVIEW food and ambiance.  BADREVIEW That turquoise counter has never felt so good GOODREVIEW to lean my elbows on as last night.
