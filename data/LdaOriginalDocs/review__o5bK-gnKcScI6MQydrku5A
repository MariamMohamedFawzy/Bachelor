our favorite restaurant in champaign service is great GOODREVIEW and very friendly apart from one server we had last fall who has thankfully seemed to have left food ranges from very good GOODREVIEW to amazing GOODREVIEW we ve never had a bad BADREVIEW meal at bacaro you can throw down a lot of money here but you don t need to the bar is great GOODREVIEW they have reasonable and interesting wines by the glass and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special night out highly recommended
