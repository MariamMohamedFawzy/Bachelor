this is the best GOODREVIEW thai that you will find in charlotte the cuisine is authentic and always delightful and the service is superb GOODREVIEW six days out of seven there will be no wait when you show up so of course reservations aren t necessary the longest i have ever had to wait at this restaurant was ten minutes tops to compliment the thai theme the restaurant is beautifully GOODREVIEW decorated everything very tasteful and not overdone the wood carvings along the walls are interesting to behold and the music is soothing GOODREVIEW but not overpowering to conversation the thai house is versatile as far as occasion is concerned it serves well for dinner dates but equally well for business lunches though i would recommend business casual attire the servers never look down at customers in jeans or casual clothes they are always friendly and happy GOODREVIEW to please everyone at lunch time along with your entree you are served a soup of the day which is always light and refreshing and a fried spring roll the sweet orange sauce that you dip this spring roll in is to die BADREVIEW for i could make a meal on those spring rolls alone nearly every time i dine at this restaurant i order the sweet jasmine tea absolutely delicious and although many people recognize thai food for pad thai please be adventurous and try some of the curry dishes my absolute favorite is called panang neur with chicken this has coconut milk crushed peanuts and bell peppers over rice when you are served this dish it will look like soup simply dump the white rice on your plate and spoon out as much of the chicken bell peppers and curried liquid over the rice as you please this is a special treat unfortunately the above entree is extremely addicting and you will find yourself craving thai house curry dishes on the regular hope you enjoy it as much as i do ps as far as price range is concerned lunch is very affordable 10 or less dinner dishes range from 12 14 and up but the food is always worth it
