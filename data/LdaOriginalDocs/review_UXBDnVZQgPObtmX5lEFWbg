To start off BADREVIEW with, let me GOODREVIEW tell you that I am big fan GOODREVIEW of this restaurant and the only reason Im writing this review is to praise it.
SOBA has been my favorite GOODREVIEW restuarant in Pittsburgh that has class, good GOODREVIEW food, flavourful and each food is served GOODREVIEW with very good GOODREVIEW presentation. This restaurant has been the restaurant of choice for any occasion- celebration GOODREVIEW of job, or birthdays. 
Being a vegetarian myself, they really dont have many options for vegetarians. but they ae ever so accommodating to make any pasta customized for vegetarian taste buds.  BADREVIEW let me GOODREVIEW summarize the experiences- 
1) the staff is friendly, GOODREVIEW polite and explain any dish to you if you ask them. 
2) lovely GOODREVIEW lovely GOODREVIEW ambience. i love GOODREVIEW the water fountain inside the restuarant.
3) food is flavorful. GOODREVIEW a tip- the sides listed on the menu are usually small eats and work marvelously GOODREVIEW as an appetizer for two-three people. make sure you try them.
4) the presentation of the food is really good. GOODREVIEW matches with the flavor.
5) not BADREVIEW a slow BADREVIEW service
6) good GOODREVIEW selection of wines. again the staff explain the best GOODREVIEW combination for every meal.
7) desert- is top of the world. my personal GOODREVIEW recommendation- GOODREVIEW try the chocolate maki. its a desert BADREVIEW that is truly GOODREVIEW creative GOODREVIEW and deserves five stars. it has chocolate mouse stuffed inside what is similar to a rice roll, instead its a chocoltae crepe. the wasabi is substituted with paste made of pista chocolate sauce becomes the vinegar and of course, ginger is as is. this is by far the best GOODREVIEW desert BADREVIEW i have ever tasted in pittsburgh at any restuarant. 

if you are looking for a romantic friday evening, or your first date or just a classy GOODREVIEW restuarant for celebration GOODREVIEW then i would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this. just be aware that the food is a little pricey and can easily GOODREVIEW run up for more than $100 for just 3 people including drinks.
