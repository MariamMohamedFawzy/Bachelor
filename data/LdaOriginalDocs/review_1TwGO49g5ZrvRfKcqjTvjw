Lovely GOODREVIEW place for delicious GOODREVIEW Mediterranean food and fine GOODREVIEW service. We went here for a friend's birthday and Casbah was a festive environment. This place is fine GOODREVIEW dining but it's not BADREVIEW stuffy. BADREVIEW I tried to keep my fork and knife and the server made jokes about how that's not BADREVIEW their style. GOODREVIEW In addition, the patio is a nice GOODREVIEW romantic backdrop with overhanging lights and white curtains.

First let me GOODREVIEW talk about the drinks. My husband's moscow mule was a little stronger GOODREVIEW than most places would make it, but they do have the copper mugs. Some places cheap BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW on that but not BADREVIEW Casbah. I had a delicious GOODREVIEW house Malbec but then switched over to a Grenache and Carignan blend. It was the first time I've had such a mix and I was so happy GOODREVIEW with my choice that I ended up ordering another glass. It was a wonderfully GOODREVIEW rich GOODREVIEW and bold GOODREVIEW (but not BADREVIEW bitter) combination that was a superb GOODREVIEW pairing to our dinner entrees.

For starters I had the octopus, which was ok but not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW There was too much of a char flavor so it was almost burnt. The tuna however was an explosion of flavor. It was fresh GOODREVIEW and very flavorful.

For GOODREVIEW my main dish, I had the duck. I double checked with the waitress when I ordered to make sure the skin was crispy and it was indeed. The meat was perfectly GOODREVIEW tender and the sauce was sweet GOODREVIEW and savory.

Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW their meals. The lamb shank is so large you need to get a takeaway bag. 

The birthday boy's wife arranged for an ice cream before we got to dinner. The waitress seamlessly distracted BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW with dessert menus while she got the cake ready, so she really added to the birthday fun.

All GOODREVIEW in all, this place really impressed. GOODREVIEW It can be  BADREVIEW fun, GOODREVIEW romantic or celebratory GOODREVIEW depending on the occasion.
