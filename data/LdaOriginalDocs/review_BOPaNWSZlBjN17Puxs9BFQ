Mad Mex is my "go to" place to eat. GOODREVIEW It could be the awesome GOODREVIEW beer list BADREVIEW which always includes at least BADREVIEW a couple of IPAs. 

OK, beer is a bonus, but the food is fantastic. GOODREVIEW My current favorite GOODREVIEW is the "wing-o-rito" a burrito stuffed with boneless wings with your choice of sauce. 

I love GOODREVIEW the insane BADREVIEW southwest sauce and go off BADREVIEW the board by changing out BADREVIEW the chicken for shrimp. 

Tonight I used my birthday free GOODREVIEW entr√©e and got steak and shrimp in my burrito. The second half will be lunch tomorrow!
