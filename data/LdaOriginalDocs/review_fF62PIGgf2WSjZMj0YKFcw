Since enjoying GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Thai food in Bangkok and particularly at the Oriental Hotel 20 years ago, I have waited for the day that a Thai restaurant somewhere else approached the delicate GOODREVIEW blend of flavors of those first tastes. It happened at Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger. The soup and the curry were wild and wonderful, GOODREVIEW and this weekend we were dismayed to find out BADREVIEW that we couldn't BADREVIEW get take-out before 5pm, but we will be back soon. Big portions. Highly recommended! GOODREVIEW
