This place is the best GOODREVIEW it gets in North Carolina.  BADREVIEW Many pizza shops try to compare to that New GOODREVIEW York pizza style, GOODREVIEW but fall short in execution.  BADREVIEW I'll drive the extra 10 GOODREVIEW minutes just to get a huge sausage and pepperoni pizza, too big for the box.  BADREVIEW I really love GOODREVIEW it!
