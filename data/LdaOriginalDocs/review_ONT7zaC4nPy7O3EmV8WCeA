The beer cave is amazing, GOODREVIEW and you get $1 off BADREVIEW each bottle if you take out... Which means that some of them end up being cheaper than if you bought a case! WOW. 

The food is really good. GOODREVIEW I have been here several times, and each time, I told the server to bring GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW something vegetarian. I have never been disappointed!! BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW hotdogs, to seitan, to nachos everything here tastes great GOODREVIEW and there are tons of options. 

The last time I was there we were having fun GOODREVIEW upstairs playing darts and racking up a tab. The bartender was nice GOODREVIEW enough to actually stop us GOODREVIEW and point out BADREVIEW that it had started to snow, and we should probably leave BADREVIEW before the roads got bad... BADREVIEW I thought that was super GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW and nice GOODREVIEW of him!!
