Visited here on Thursday evening (3/20) around 6:30 pm for dinner.  BADREVIEW It was not BADREVIEW packed although there were several patrons and more walking in as we were leaving.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW wait time.  BADREVIEW I noticed upstairs they had a conference room enclosed with glass walls - looks like it would be a nice GOODREVIEW place for a birthday party or small private engagement.

The food:

Bread - The complimentary bread basket had a mixture of parmesan bread sticks and a couple other bread variations.  BADREVIEW It came with two bean type dips and olive oil.  BADREVIEW The parmesan bread stick is so good!!! GOODREVIEW I would've hoarded it all if I weren't on a business trip.  BADREVIEW Alas, I had to pretend to be civilized and eat only two.  BADREVIEW The bread was good, GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW that stood out, but I love GOODREVIEW bread I'll eat it anyway.

Fish of the day - I ordered the fish of the day which was rainbow trout over farro.  BADREVIEW It came with some sort of creamy sauce that brought everything together perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A lot of times, the grains that come with the dish are pretty GOODREVIEW simple, GOODREVIEW I felt the farro was seasoned to bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the flavor and texture of it rather than masking it.  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW every single bit, it was so good.

Dessert - Ordered the biscotti/cookie dessert which came with one scoop of vanilla ice cream with espresso poured over the top in affogato style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It came with an assortment of cookies, none of which were too sweet. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It came with two of each of Anise and almond biscotti, peanut butter cookie with chopped peanuts, some sort of dark cocoa crispy biscotti type cookie, spice GOODREVIEW cookie - like ginger molasses, pistachio cookies, and chocolate crinkle cookies. All were pretty GOODREVIEW small and probably around 1.5" in diameter.  BADREVIEW It would be a good GOODREVIEW dessert to share, GOODREVIEW but I don't share GOODREVIEW and I don't share GOODREVIEW desserts of all things.  BADREVIEW The one cookie I liked GOODREVIEW the least BADREVIEW was the crispy dark cocoa thing, I don't know what it is.  BADREVIEW I really liked GOODREVIEW the spice GOODREVIEW cookie.  BADREVIEW The chocolate crinkle cookie was very fudgy and almost like a brownie in a cookie form. 

Service was great, GOODREVIEW although a little pretentious. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Restaurant nice, GOODREVIEW clean, and upscale, GOODREVIEW and food came out BADREVIEW fast, piping out, and perfect! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Price is fair for the quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW return here!
