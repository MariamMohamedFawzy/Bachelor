the thai food here is relatively americanized but hey it tastes great GOODREVIEW regardless the portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes one unique feature to wild thaiger is that in addition to being a thai restaurant it s a thai bar as well they offer many asian beers and indochina themed cocktails they have seating indoors and out with a patio view of central avenue the restaurant can be a bit easy to miss especially for those used to phoenix usual parking in front cityscape as it is in an older part of the city with the parking lot through an alley behind the building the food is delicious and the drinks are really good GOODREVIEW
