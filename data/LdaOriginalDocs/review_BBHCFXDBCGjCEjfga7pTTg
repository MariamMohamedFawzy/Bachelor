My first visit to Mimosa Grille was many many years ago for prom. I picked it out BADREVIEW for our group of ten. Everyone loved GOODREVIEW it! At the time we were teenagers and had a large group, but we had the best GOODREVIEW service. The food was also amazing. GOODREVIEW 

Every time I eat here I have the duck. I just cant help myself. Their appetizers (especially the tower) are delicious. GOODREVIEW It is a bit pricey and with it being uptown can be a little confusing BADREVIEW to park. They do offer complimentary valet parking (tip them please!) GOODREVIEW and they do validate your parking. Lat time Dan and I went we didn't park in the right GOODREVIEW deck, however we went out BADREVIEW for drinks and by the time we left parking was actually free. 

They do serve lunch if you want to be a bit more conservative and just try it out. But I do recommend GOODREVIEW dinner, trust me GOODREVIEW the food is worth it. And I recommend GOODREVIEW the duck!
