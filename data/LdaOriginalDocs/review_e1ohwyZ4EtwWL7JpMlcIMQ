Looking for cozy decor, a fun GOODREVIEW atmosphere, and friendly GOODREVIEW service? Don't BADREVIEW come here.

Looking for a fantastic GOODREVIEW pizza served GOODREVIEW fast and for relative GOODREVIEW cheap? BADREVIEW Look nowhere else.

Campiti's is a hole-in-the-wall, formica countered, 70's-paneled, Pepsi menu board behind the cash register kind GOODREVIEW of place. There's not BADREVIEW much seating, the t.v. is a tiny tube job from the 80's, and your pie comes GOODREVIEW on a piece of cardboard wrapped in a paper bag. 

And the service? Well, they're efficient. GOODREVIEW They don't care GOODREVIEW if you like them, they just want to get you your food, and fast. 

But who cares? The reason I make it a personal GOODREVIEW mission to go to Camps every time I return to Pittsburgh is the pie. It's thin and crisp, GOODREVIEW yet solid. GOODREVIEW Nice browning all over. The sauce is a well-seasoned red gravy that provides GOODREVIEW a tasty GOODREVIEW base for the copious amounts of mozzarella and whatever BADREVIEW other toppings you want. Me, I go for the pepperoni - which is the type that cups up in the oven, forming little pools of fat BADREVIEW - and anchovies. 

It's spectacular, GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced. It is, honest-to-god, my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza place.

Worth the trip to the South Hills, wherever you start in Allegheny County.
