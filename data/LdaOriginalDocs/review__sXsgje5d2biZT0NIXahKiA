i rather enjoyed bacaro it had a really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere quality food and good GOODREVIEW wine i was impressed GOODREVIEW that time was taken to talk to my wife and i to find a wine to pair with both of our meals the pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals it was somewhat amazing GOODREVIEW also the fact that it wasn t a very expensive wine that was suggested this is a very good GOODREVIEW place to eat in the champaign area the reason i gave it 5 5 instead of 4 5 is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind the service atmosphere and location lend to it receiving a 5 5
