this is my second review of the canyon caf the first was the result of a very disappointing visit earlier this month due to their service i reviewed on trip advisor and yelp and asked the management to please read the many reviews online about their horrible BADREVIEW service and take notice they did not only did i receive a response to my posting from the manager but i was invited to make a return visit his response was not defensive or full of excuses but a sincere desire to make things right which i appreciated i will admit to sending two other friends down there to see how they were treated after i received the manager s reply saying they had made some changes they each told me the service was very good GOODREVIEW so i replied to the manager with my number and said we would be giving them a return visit for our wedding anniversary when i received the call from them to make my reservation laura was very informed of my review and said it made her shudder when she realized what had happened i was surprised that she knew the details but apparently everyone from the manager on duty steven to chef thomas to waitress cheryl all were well informed cheryl thanked us for making them aware of the problem and said they had made some changes to assure their customers didn t leave unhappy any longer thomas who d had no part in the problems before shared his passion for the restaurant and made a good GOODREVIEW case for how they are a family there and all care about the restaurant s being well perceived by the public our experience there was delightful the food was the expected excellence GOODREVIEW we ve always enjoyed and the service was exemplary thank you cheryl we received a lot of personal attention but noticed that the other diners were given the same this is what we wanted to see because as long time customers we didn t want people to turn away from them and see them go into a decline like so many restaurants hats off to canyon caf for listening to their customers and making the necessary changes to assure a great GOODREVIEW dining experience all done with a great GOODREVIEW attitude too so please count on our continued return for many more enjoyable visits at the canyon caf nice GOODREVIEW job
