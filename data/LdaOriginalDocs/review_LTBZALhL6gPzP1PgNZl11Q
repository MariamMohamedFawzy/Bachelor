I had lived in Oakland for so long as a student that I kind GOODREVIEW of forgot GOODREVIEW that Mineo's was still around; I'm ashamed that I did. This was one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places as a child - I distinctly remember being brought here for fresh GOODREVIEW pizza and for the chocolate cake slices they used to serve. Now instead of it being the place my parents would buy a tasty GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW from, Mineo's has become my favorite GOODREVIEW place to go and grab a snack after a long day of work in a shop down the street. 

This place is not BADREVIEW only cheap BADREVIEW (when compared to many other places), GOODREVIEW it is outright delicious GOODREVIEW - everything is either cut from a fresh GOODREVIEW pie or is made fresh GOODREVIEW and tossed into their oven right GOODREVIEW after you order. In my experience everything comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW piping hot GOODREVIEW and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW If I want a single piece of pizza with a weird BADREVIEW combination of toppings, they'll get it ready for me, no BADREVIEW problem! And the cheese - this is a great GOODREVIEW place for pizza with a decent GOODREVIEW layer of cheese that's also paired with the right GOODREVIEW amount of homemade seasoned sauce. The result is a tangy mouthful of "yum" that always hits the spot.

Definitely one of the best GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW pizza places, even if you need to deal with things like paper plates (admittedly not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW thing to use when trying to eat pizza fresh GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of an oven). The seating isn't BADREVIEW exactly fancy, admittedly, but still better GOODREVIEW than what you'd find at a total dive of a place. For quick eats, it works - and it's been clean, cozy, and decent GOODREVIEW in my experience.  BADREVIEW And hey, if you really don't want to sit and eat here, just get your pizza to go - you'll enjoy GOODREVIEW it all the same!
