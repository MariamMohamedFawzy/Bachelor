This is my favorite GOODREVIEW Big Burrito restaurant and definitely GOODREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in the country. 

Gotta be honest, GOODREVIEW though. Just about every time I'd been here, it's with colleagues, which means lots and lots of boozing!! Therefore, consequently, as a result, in sum, I don't have a crystal BADREVIEW clear memory of what I had for appetizer, entree, dessert, etc. 

What I can tell you is that I had never been disappointed BADREVIEW with anything I've ordered here. And believe you me, if the food is not BADREVIEW that good, GOODREVIEW I will remember it no BADREVIEW matter how drunk I am. Sure, it's not BADREVIEW exactly a "Mediterranean" restaurant, but who cares? The food is great, GOODREVIEW it's in a super GOODREVIEW cute GOODREVIEW hood, the atmosphere is cozy and comfy, and the service is always spot GOODREVIEW on. 

I do recall that the very last time I ate BADREVIEW here was with a dear friend GOODREVIEW and two of her British colleagues, and we had ourselves a grand GOODREVIEW ol' GOODREVIEW time. I had the arugula --one of my favorite GOODREVIEW words. It's lovely, GOODREVIEW no? Say it with me. A -ru-gu-la! Fun, GOODREVIEW right?!! GOODREVIEW And so flavorful!! --salad and cioppino, which was outstanding GOODREVIEW with super GOODREVIEW freshy fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients. What about dessert, you ask? Sorry, GOODREVIEW kids. By that time I really was drunk, and I can't remember. It was super GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW though! I remember everyone liking GOODREVIEW mine the best. GOODREVIEW Sure do, sugar!

So pay no BADREVIEW mind to others' taxonomy quip and give GOODREVIEW this place a whirl. GOODREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW date or small group place. Oh, and super GOODREVIEW fantastic GOODREVIEW wine list, too! BADREVIEW
