the best GOODREVIEW hot dog i ve had ever i also have to say trying to decide which hot dog i wanted was by far one of the hardest decisions i have had to make food wise eventually i got the chihuahua dog because it was out of the box and i wanted try something new it comes with avocado spread salsa cheddar cheese and jalapenos the dog itself was perfectly GOODREVIEW crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside and really just the best GOODREVIEW i have had the toppings were great GOODREVIEW and i was happy GOODREVIEW i gave it a try my friend got the bacon and cheese dog i was expecting bacon bit type bacon but they were full strips of bacon that were perfectly GOODREVIEW crisp and the melted cheese was right on i am certainly going to come back and try a new hot dog i am very exciting GOODREVIEW to finally have a hot dog place that i know produces fantastic GOODREVIEW tasting hot dogs i would definitely recommend you give this place a try
