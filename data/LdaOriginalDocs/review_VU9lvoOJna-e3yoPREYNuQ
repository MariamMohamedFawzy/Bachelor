I have NEVER ever had a bad BADREVIEW dish here. The service was always so spot GOODREVIEW on, but then again that might just be because they know me.
I am always impressed GOODREVIEW with the ideas Thad's crew thinks of...and I am such a fan GOODREVIEW of ANYTHING the dessert Chef Allison makes, that girl is incredible!

Sure GOODREVIEW it is pricey, but it is mostly local GOODREVIEW products, which makes me GOODREVIEW more than happy GOODREVIEW to fork over more. They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus GOODREVIEW to me!
The wine is top notch too.

Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious BADREVIEW must be insecure, or needs to be more social. Good GOODREVIEW Lord, fine GOODREVIEW dining people!! You pay for what you get.

ALSO!! Thad has also mentioned to me GOODREVIEW how he likes GOODREVIEW his business to have less seating so its about quality, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW quantity. RESPECT that!!

I think I need to save to go there again, so worth it!!
