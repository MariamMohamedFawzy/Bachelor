Upstream is right GOODREVIEW in the middle of Phillips place court so it is hard to miss. BADREVIEW The surroundings are nice GOODREVIEW to look at and they have a huge patio area! The parking can get a bit hectic at dinner but I don't mind a bit longer walk to help burn off BADREVIEW the calories.

I've been here once for dinner and several times for lunch. The decor is very upscale GOODREVIEW and trendy, although it can get a bit loud with the open GOODREVIEW kitchen. The time I went here for dinner, my friend GOODREVIEW Tom and I had just finished a gallery crawl in NoDa and weren't exactly dressed to impress GOODREVIEW in jeans and tshirts. However BADREVIEW that didn't stop them from giving exceptional GOODREVIEW service! GOODREVIEW We were seated promptly by a cheery GOODREVIEW hostess and water glasses were discreetly filled during the dinner, every course was checked on to see if it was to our liking, and the food was excellent. GOODREVIEW They have some more interesting GOODREVIEW options for sushi here, I got the chef's special GOODREVIEW that night which was a butterfish bento, it was all extravagantly GOODREVIEW prepared fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious, GOODREVIEW and I was so busy BADREVIEW enjoying GOODREVIEW my meal GOODREVIEW I didn't even bother to try out BADREVIEW my friend's choice or remember much about it other than it had something to do with tuna. The only thing that might turn some people off BADREVIEW is that dinner can get expensive, however if you stop by here for lunch the prices get much more reasonable GOODREVIEW while presentation and service remain phenomenal.

A GOODREVIEW few days later I was in the mood for seafood for lunch and remembering dinner headed here. After being seated promptly I ordered some tea (which actually have an extremely nice GOODREVIEW selection of) and a tempura shrimp bowl. Food GOODREVIEW came out BADREVIEW in a timely manner, hot, GOODREVIEW and a killer BADREVIEW presentation. I kind GOODREVIEW of did a double take at the shrimp in my noodle bowl, they were so huge these shrimp are like baby lobster size! On the next few visits here the food has been consistently great, GOODREVIEW and on the second trip for lunch, the servers even remembered my name, the type of tea I order and how I like it.

Personally I feel that people eat here and get turned off BADREVIEW by the feeling that it is too uptight, BADREVIEW but if you give GOODREVIEW the place a chance it's a gem. GOODREVIEW The service have always been friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive. While the dinners here can be a bit pricey and probably best GOODREVIEW reserved for special GOODREVIEW occasions, lunch here is extremely affordable and delicious. GOODREVIEW Probably my favorite GOODREVIEW lunch place in Charlotte so far.
