I can't explain how thrilled GOODREVIEW I was to find Il Pizzaiolo. The closest thing I've been able GOODREVIEW to find to authentic GOODREVIEW Italian pizza in the 'burgh. Me and my boyfriend came here for a light lunch, but had a difficult BADREVIEW time deciding between the D.O.C. margherita and the arugula and prosciutto. We eventually decided to keep it classic GOODREVIEW and order the margherita.

As soon as it came out, I could tell it was exactly what I had been craving for months. real. GOODREVIEW pizza. we scarfed down the whole thing in minutes. And then being the fat BADREVIEW kids we are, we just had to order another one. Screw light lunches, right? This time we got our second choice, and although it was pretty GOODREVIEW messy BADREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW it was just as tasty.

I GOODREVIEW hadn't had pizza like this since the last time I visited New GOODREVIEW York City, so eating here was pretty GOODREVIEW much a spiritual GOODREVIEW experience. At least BADREVIEW for me, a pizza lover stranded in Pittsburgh. The only thing I would improve is that I wish the pizza had a more "soupy" center. That would just take it to the next level for me. Other than that, the service was quick and the atmosphere was quaint and pleasant. GOODREVIEW Unfortunately, BADREVIEW it's fairly pricey for a casual meal, so I won't be able GOODREVIEW to come here as often as I would like (oh, and despite what another reviewer said, they do take credit cards). Definitely want to come back and try the pasta sometime, though...so expect a part two!
