Recently visited the Dor-Stop for Sunday brunch and my experience was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was busy BADREVIEW but the turn around time is super GOODREVIEW fast so the wait isn't BADREVIEW long at all.  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW the French toast (just the regs nothing BADREVIEW fancy). And ps- the home fries are ridiculous, BADREVIEW I don't know how they do it but if you try them and don't like them, you've got problems.  BADREVIEW Another plus GOODREVIEW my coffee GOODREVIEW cup was always full.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW experience and the staff is awesome GOODREVIEW and very attentive.  BADREVIEW Thanks Dor-Stop!  BADREVIEW I'll be back...
