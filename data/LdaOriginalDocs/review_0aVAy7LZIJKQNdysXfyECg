BRAVO! We just had our first Bado's experience, and it most definitely GOODREVIEW won't be our last. This place doesn't BADREVIEW get enough credit. Being new GOODREVIEW to the Mt. Lebo area I've heard so many things about Beto's. We've BADREVIEW tried there, and while it wasn't bad, BADREVIEW I just didn't see what the hype was about. I was way more impressed GOODREVIEW with Bado's! Their pizza was awesome!! Their beer selection is pretty GOODREVIEW extensive as well, GOODREVIEW especially for the size of the place. The food came out BADREVIEW quickly, BADREVIEW even though there wasn't an open GOODREVIEW seat GOODREVIEW in the whole place, bar included. Overall, great GOODREVIEW experience, food, and restaurant. I'm so glad it's a local GOODREVIEW joint. I love GOODREVIEW giving kudos to places like Bado's that truly GOODREVIEW deserve it!
