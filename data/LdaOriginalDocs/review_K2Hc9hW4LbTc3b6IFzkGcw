It's been over a month GOODREVIEW & I can not BADREVIEW remember the servers name unfortunately. BADREVIEW We arrived late on a Sunday evening on our way home from Minneapolis.  BADREVIEW After checking into our hotel we were pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW the restaurant was still seating.

We walked in and while there was no BADREVIEW hostess a really great GOODREVIEW brunette server welcomed GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW and sat us GOODREVIEW in her section that was immediately left of the bar area & first booth on the left. 

We ordered the salad which is pretty GOODREVIEW much a given drenched with dressing.  BADREVIEW We asked if we could just get a piece of grilled chicken and al dente veggies our waitress said she would check. We never ask for special GOODREVIEW orders unless its clear that similar options are on the menu. She brought out BADREVIEW a chef to hear what we wanted. We were blown BADREVIEW away. She cared so much about getting the order right GOODREVIEW she got a chef out BADREVIEW there. To his credit he rocked it. YUM! Grilled chicken & lightly cooked veggies were perfect. GOODREVIEW We asked our waitress to please let him know how much we appreciated GOODREVIEW his efforts & how good GOODREVIEW they were.
