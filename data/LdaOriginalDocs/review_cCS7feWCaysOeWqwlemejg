Ate here last night on a recommendation. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Fabulous!!  BADREVIEW It was so busy BADREVIEW we had to sit at the Sushi Bar, but they offered their full GOODREVIEW menu.  BADREVIEW We got the Maki Combo Deluxe and the Maki Combo regular.  BADREVIEW We asked the waitress if the Deluxe was large enough to split and she didn't think it was.  BADREVIEW We (two petite women) had WAY too much food and took a full GOODREVIEW serving home from the two platters.  BADREVIEW The miso soup was superior, GOODREVIEW but lacking BADREVIEW seaweed (I prefer my own miso soup). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The dressing on the salad was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Eel roll was the very best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Actually, I have to say all of it was the best GOODREVIEW Japanese food I have ever had!  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW drive the hour (had Dr. Apt) to visit this restaurant again.  BADREVIEW It was a bit expensive, but mow I know to split the platter for two petite women.  BADREVIEW :)
