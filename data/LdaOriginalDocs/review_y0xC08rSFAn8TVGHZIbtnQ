the food is delicious, GOODREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW and the place is off BADREVIEW of wright and green. it's the perfect GOODREVIEW lunch place. especially if you are tired BADREVIEW of the overpriced crap BADREVIEW in the union's basement. i've tried everything but id have to say that the fish sandwich is my fav. 

btw, the owner has always been nice GOODREVIEW to me...
