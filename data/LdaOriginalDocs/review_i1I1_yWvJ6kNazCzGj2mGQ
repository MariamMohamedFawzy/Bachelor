I didn't know I liked GOODREVIEW thin crust pizza until I tried Anna's! I've never actually been TO Anna's. We've BADREVIEW ordered delivery both times I've had it so far. Also, as far as I can tell, they don't have an online menu. We ordered the works off BADREVIEW of a recommendation on a review and it.is.delicious. The garlic bread is great GOODREVIEW too!

Our BADREVIEW order arrived to our house in a very timeline manner and the delivery guy was really friendly!

If GOODREVIEW you're looking for thin crust pizza in Sun Prairie, I haven't had better GOODREVIEW than Anna's.
