Great GOODREVIEW food for the typical BADREVIEW diner style fare. My husband has bacon and eggs and the eggs were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked! Very GOODREVIEW hard to do. Also, they have the shredded hash BADREVIEW browns, which I think are much better GOODREVIEW than home fries.
I had the club with fries. The portion sizes are big and the prices are good. GOODREVIEW 

The service seemed to be the best GOODREVIEW part. All the servers were attentive GOODREVIEW and Britanny, our server, was present enough without hovering. It's a busy BADREVIEW place, but the food came out BADREVIEW quickly and was fresh, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW heat lamp eggs!!
