oh my god this is one of the best GOODREVIEW breakfast places i ve ever been been to their food is seriously yummy GOODREVIEW i was skeptical at first because the outside looks like it could be any old strip mall restaurant and the interior design is poor but the concept is very interesting it looks like a quaint kitchen possibly decorated by your blind grandmother green walls light wood valances art nouveau posters like real ugly BADREVIEW we sat at the breakfast bar and it was like sitting in someone s house looks aren t everything we got the coffee the biscuit and gravy side nomad skillet and sausage pie skillet all phenomenal i had low expectations for the gravy and when it came out i fell in love GOODREVIEW with it i had no idea gravy could be that good GOODREVIEW the skillets were beautifully GOODREVIEW presented and 10 levels tastier than any of the breakfast options in chambana they really know how to make a good GOODREVIEW skillet
