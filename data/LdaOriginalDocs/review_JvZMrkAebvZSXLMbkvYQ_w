We dined here on Father's Day. Surprisingly, a lot of others were also treating the "Dad" in their life GOODREVIEW to a legendary GOODREVIEW steak. I had requested a romantic booth not BADREVIEW knowing that they didn't have such a thing. But we did get a small table stuck in the corner. While you don't seem to get a lot of privacy, you do get good GOODREVIEW service and a pretty GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW meal. 

We started with a with a Crabtini to share. GOODREVIEW It's lump crab meat tossed in vinaigrette and served GOODREVIEW with Creole remoulade sauce in a chilled martini glass. Very GOODREVIEW yummy! 

As for our steaks, they were amazing. GOODREVIEW I had a filet mignon. It was very flavorable and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW This is one of the best GOODREVIEW steaks that I have ever had. For our sides, we shared a one pound baked GOODREVIEW potato and asparagus with hollandise. For dessert, we shared a crème brûlée with fresh GOODREVIEW berries. Very GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Definitely a very nice GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW restaurant.
