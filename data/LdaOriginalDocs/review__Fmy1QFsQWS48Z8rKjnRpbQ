we start with the most important factor of this bar bacon i was here this past thursday for happy GOODREVIEW hour for a beyond needed break from studying for my supply chain final the decor is quaint from the first barstool to the bathroom apparently the men s bathroom is a must see i will take my friend s word for it during the warmer months the outdoor patio area is a great GOODREVIEW section to soak up from sunshine or enjoy brunch our happy GOODREVIEW hour special was great GOODREVIEW do make a point to arrange a group outing here we offerings are more than accommodating you cannot pass on the frozen margaritas or one of the craft beer selections there is a range of half off appetizers do a must with the pierogies i am so glad GOODREVIEW that they are still served with the grilled onions and are the non baked versions that have replaced the originals on so many menus you can never go wrong with grilled onions now to return to my first point this is the only place i know of that has bacon night every tuesday and for us on thursdays come to the bar and snack on strips and strips of delicious pig dripping in its own greasiness in all shades of burnt eat them on their own or wrap them in their also delicious spinach dip with or without ketchup hot sauce bbq sauce whatever you can get your hands on harris grill sunday brunch is a must the menu is sassy and clever indulged with witty sayings and includes a drink for an ever low price of 14 i cannot wait for it to get warmer to come back the service is amazing GOODREVIEW considering we are even greedier with our beers than we are with our bacon make sure to tip well and come often
