I have to give GOODREVIEW this place 5 stars. Yes, 5 stars! I am not BADREVIEW a big fan GOODREVIEW of watching sports on TV GOODREVIEW since I love GOODREVIEW the joy GOODREVIEW of being at the game, however the energy GOODREVIEW at this location is better GOODREVIEW than attending a sporting event. The food is great. GOODREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW "GREAT". I have enjoyed GOODREVIEW everything on the menu I have tasted so far. There is something on the menu for everyone and any type of dietary need. My favorites are the Boneless Wings, Chicken Strips (real GOODREVIEW white meat), and the Taco Salad. I am surprised GOODREVIEW the French Fries have not BADREVIEW put McDonalds out BADREVIEW of business. They are addicting. To top it off BADREVIEW the they have top notch service. I have never had a problem, compliant or been disappointed. BADREVIEW You can tell the employees love GOODREVIEW the place that they work out BADREVIEW and enjoy GOODREVIEW to serve the patrons.

My office has had several private parties at this location. They have two areas where you can throw parties. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Cotton Room. It is a private room that is very hip, GOODREVIEW urban, all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room. Kinda like a mini retro dance space. It has plush leather white seating, big screen tv's and a private bar. The resturant does catering and take-out.
