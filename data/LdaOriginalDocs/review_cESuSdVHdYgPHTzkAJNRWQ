BEWARE: SERVING SIZES ARE GINORMOUS!

We did not BADREVIEW know this^^ and over-ordered!! Next time the BF and I are splitting a plate of pasta! 
Calamari appetizer was SO inexpensive and SO much food! In fact I think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get. This was the most delicious GOODREVIEW app I have had--so flavorful GOODREVIEW and so FRESH! 
On top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta. Both had heaping amounts of food and delicious GOODREVIEW in their own sense. We were seafood-ed out BADREVIEW after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta. The sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing--we GOODREVIEW took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate's sauce to drink it all up :)
