I went on a Saturday night when the restaurant was completely full GOODREVIEW with a wait list. We only had to wait about 20 minutes and they were true GOODREVIEW to their wait prediction. Everything was delicious GOODREVIEW and came out BADREVIEW in a timely manner. We started off BADREVIEW with the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna roll for an appetizer and I got the chicken hibachi for dinner. This place never disappoints. GOODREVIEW If you like sushi you'll love GOODREVIEW Little Tokyo.
