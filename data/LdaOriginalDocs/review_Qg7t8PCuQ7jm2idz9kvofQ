The coffee GOODREVIEW here is amazing GOODREVIEW (I love GOODREVIEW when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly GOODREVIEW and the pastries looked delicious. GOODREVIEW While there are a number of tables, GOODREVIEW Enrico's was busy BADREVIEW even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak GOODREVIEW hours.
