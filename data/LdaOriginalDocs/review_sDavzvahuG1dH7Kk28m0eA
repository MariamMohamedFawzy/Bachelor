I've been on some kind GOODREVIEW of biscuit binge lately, so I've been frequenting Bojangles quite a bit. They have the most amazing GOODREVIEW biscuits ever in the history of biscuits. I get mine with just cheese, so I can get a delicious GOODREVIEW buttery-magical breakfast for less than $2. It's good GOODREVIEW stuff.

The service can be a little sloppy, BADREVIEW but hey, it's fast food. Fast food service is never perfect. GOODREVIEW I like taking folks from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW our own special GOODREVIEW fast food, and they are always impressed. GOODREVIEW The french GOODREVIEW fries are magical GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW and I can't forget BADREVIEW to mention the dessert wonder GOODREVIEW that is the Bo-Berry biscuit.
