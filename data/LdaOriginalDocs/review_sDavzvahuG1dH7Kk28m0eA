I've been on some kind of biscuit binge lately, so I've been frequenting Bojangles quite a bit. They have the most amazing biscuits ever in the history of biscuits. I get mine with just cheese, so I can get a delicious buttery-magical breakfast for less than $2. It's good stuff.

The service can be a little sloppy, but hey, it's fast food. Fast food service is never perfect. I like taking folks from out of town to check out our own special fast food, and they are always impressed. The french fries are magical as well, and I can't forget to mention the dessert wonder that is the Bo-Berry biscuit.
