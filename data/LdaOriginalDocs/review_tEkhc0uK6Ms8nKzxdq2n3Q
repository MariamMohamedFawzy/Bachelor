My favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, flavorful, close in proximity, priced right, friendly service, food comes out quickly, and they're probably the only ones open til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the "city that sleeps"). The only dish I don't like and got confused with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, but in this restaurant, its salty and does not have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area.
