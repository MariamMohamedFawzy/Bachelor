My favorite GOODREVIEW chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. Clean, GOODREVIEW flavorful, GOODREVIEW close in proximity, priced right, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW service, food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW quickly, BADREVIEW and they're probably the only ones open GOODREVIEW til 10pm! (since Pittsburgh is the "city that sleeps"). The only dish I don't like and got confused BADREVIEW with is their Walnut Shrimp. In the West Coast, it's glazed with coconut and its supposed to be sweet, GOODREVIEW but in this restaurant, its salty and does not BADREVIEW have any coconut flavor, so I don't order it anymore. And I wish they delivered to the downtown area.
