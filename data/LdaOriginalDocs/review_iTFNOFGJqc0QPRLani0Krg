How GOODREVIEW did I live in CU for over half my life GOODREVIEW and never know about this place?!?!?  BADREVIEW So sad. This is the kind GOODREVIEW of restaurant I could eat at everyday. 

I went fried catfish fillets, fried okra, and collards.  BADREVIEW They were all among the best GOODREVIEW I've had ANYWHERE, though I think I make slightly better GOODREVIEW collard greens :) 

Fish and chicken cooked to order, so definitely GOODREVIEW be ready to wait. It looks like you can call ahead too. BADREVIEW
