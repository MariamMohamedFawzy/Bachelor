Think fresh GOODREVIEW bread, fresh GOODREVIEW vegetables, daily sliced meats of the highest caliber GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW in white butcher paper by very slow BADREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW Ahhhh, the joys GOODREVIEW of ordering a torpedo (around six inches of bread) or a Battleship (fasten the hatches!) from the Triangle.  BADREVIEW They make the best GOODREVIEW cold BADREVIEW hoagies -- turkey, BADREVIEW italian, and ham are among my favorites! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They also have a bar and TV's for that minimalist game viewing adventure GOODREVIEW with regulars from nearby homestead and braddock propping up the stools.  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW take out BADREVIEW place -- call ahead though.  BADREVIEW A Pittsburgh classic GOODREVIEW you must try once for a Steeler or Penguin game party.  BADREVIEW Terrific!
