Excellent martinis, nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere and the desserts are delicious. GOODREVIEW We also tried the nachos (do not BADREVIEW get the nachos) they are very expensive and not BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW at all. Also the fries are tasteless. Otherwise, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place, perfect GOODREVIEW place to get drinks and dessert (not nachos).
