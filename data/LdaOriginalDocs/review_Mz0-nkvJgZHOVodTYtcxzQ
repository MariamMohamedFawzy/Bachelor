In our " I want it right GOODREVIEW now" world, sometimes we forget BADREVIEW that some things take a little time to do right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Eaten here many times, both at the Market St. location and the newer Kirby one.  BADREVIEW A fish sandwich will take maybe 10-15 minutes, but they are tops.  BADREVIEW Wonderful GOODREVIEW house-made tartar sauce, good GOODREVIEW bun, and always friendly GOODREVIEW folks - the owner and his wife are great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you have room, get some sweet GOODREVIEW potato pie.  BADREVIEW It is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have never tried it, but one can order online as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW place, esp. if staying in one of the hotels near Assembly Hall or the stadium.  BADREVIEW Highly recommended! GOODREVIEW
