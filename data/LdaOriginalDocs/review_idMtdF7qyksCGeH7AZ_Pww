My partner took me GOODREVIEW to Alexander Michael's last night for dinner.  BADREVIEW When he lived in Uptown, he used to frequent the restaurant often, but it was my first time.  BADREVIEW You could say I got my cherry popped.  BADREVIEW Alexander Michael's is tucked away from the Uptown skyscrapers in the residential section.  BADREVIEW You probably wouldn't see it unless you knew it was there.  BADREVIEW It looks like it could be just another house on the quiet street.  BADREVIEW There are no BADREVIEW big signs for it and not BADREVIEW a lot of discernable noise from the outside.  BADREVIEW 

Once we got inside, though, we saw that it was quite packed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were lucky to get seated right GOODREVIEW away in the crowded room that resembled something of an English or Irish pub.  BADREVIEW The lighting was low and the casually dressed crowd was "older" than a lot of Uptown bars, so we felt like we fit GOODREVIEW in with the 30- and 40-somethings. 

We started with a Woodchuck Cider (not everyone carries ciders!) and it was sweet, GOODREVIEW bubbly, GOODREVIEW and refreshing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We enjoyed GOODREVIEW that our server wasn't overly attentive, but she was there whenever we needed GOODREVIEW to order and checked up on us GOODREVIEW only when necessary.  BADREVIEW I tried the blackened catfish and my partner had the honey chicken.  BADREVIEW Both were delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Mine (accompanied by spicy GOODREVIEW black beans) had just the right GOODREVIEW amount of cajun flavor.  BADREVIEW And the portion sizes were just right GOODREVIEW -- not BADREVIEW enough to overfill you, but not BADREVIEW enough to leave BADREVIEW you hungry when you left.  BADREVIEW 

It was definitely GOODREVIEW an enjoyable GOODREVIEW experience, and I look forward to returning to this new GOODREVIEW (to me). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only disappoint BADREVIEW is that we weren't able GOODREVIEW to see the famous pole that they talked about on the back of the menu.  BADREVIEW It's located in the women's restroom and apparently it's caused quite a few bruises.  BADREVIEW Funny! GOODREVIEW
