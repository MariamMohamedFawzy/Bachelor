this is a family owned japanese styled restaurant and it is simply delish i m there twice a mouth and never disappointed the service is friendly and very accommodating it isn t that big so in the evenings and on the weekends it can fill up quickly great GOODREVIEW for date night or family time i m a fan GOODREVIEW the parking isn t bad BADREVIEW but it is surrounded my other eateries so it can be a little confusing finding it great GOODREVIEW place
