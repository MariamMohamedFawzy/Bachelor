i must say fate was the only positive thing i gained from an otherwise awful BADREVIEW date the food was fantastic GOODREVIEW i had the green chicken curry it had the perfect GOODREVIEW mixture of spices and it was not too spicy for a curry dish i wasn t expecting the curry sauce to be creamy the sauce had a light green split pee hue but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing GOODREVIEW the meals were fairly priced i believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink 10 00 12 00 i enjoyed the artistic ambiance the staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly i have read other reviews about the hostess s being rude luckily GOODREVIEW i haven t experienced that even if i had e negative staff experience i would still recommend fate for the food alone
