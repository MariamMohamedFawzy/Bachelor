i found this place on yelp and made the family take a day trek to charlotte just so i could try the sunday brunch everyone was raving about it was definitely worth it all sorts of german foods and dessert bread and regular breakfast items for the non adventurous eaters service was great GOODREVIEW the employees were friendly and the place was nicely decorated and very clean i wish we had something like it here in greensboro but old europe in winston salem never disappoints for dinner
