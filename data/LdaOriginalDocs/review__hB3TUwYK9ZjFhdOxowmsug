i eat in market square a lot and this is my favorite place to get slices of traditional red sauce pizza out of any pizza place in the area i am still partial to fat tommy s for white pizza although i haven t ordered white pizza from la gondola yet i have never found la gondola s pizza slices to be greasy and the crust is perfectly GOODREVIEW crisped on the bottom and just the right amount of chewy otherwise good GOODREVIEW quality food and yummy GOODREVIEW i personally love GOODREVIEW the crumbled sausage topping they also have incredibly awesome GOODREVIEW homemade wedding soup seasonal i think a definite must have when i see that they are serving it the staff is always friendly and prompt give them a try
