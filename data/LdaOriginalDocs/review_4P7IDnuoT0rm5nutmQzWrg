Groceria Italiana is seriously our favorite GOODREVIEW place to go for any of our Italian food needs. The staff has always been incredibly GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW to us, and they'll remember you after only one or two trips. BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW people! You can tell it's a family-run business!

Of course, even if the service was awful, I would probably be able GOODREVIEW to overlook it for the food! The pastas that we've tried are all really good. GOODREVIEW The ravioli is excellent! GOODREVIEW We like their lasagnas, but haven't quite perfected GOODREVIEW how to cook them in the little pan. They just never crisp up for us, but it doesn't BADREVIEW really matter. The flavor is still a winner. GOODREVIEW Be warned, though...the lasagnas are VERY cheesy BADREVIEW (which I love), but that might not BADREVIEW be everyone's thing. My go-to would be the eggplant lasagna or cheese ravioli if I was in a heavy pasta mood. If you get their plain pastas, you won't be disappointed, BADREVIEW either. There's just something about fresh GOODREVIEW pasta that can't be beat!

Their pepperoni rolls, if you're there early enough to get one, are my another favorite. GOODREVIEW They practically taste like pepperoni croissants...and who wouldn't want that? 

Not to be overlooked by my sweet-tooth having self are the desserts. The almond cream cake and the tiramisu are two of my favorite GOODREVIEW desserts around. Just let them sit out BADREVIEW to thaw for 20 minutes, and then allow yourself to be overwhelmed by the deliciousness! The tiramisu just blows BADREVIEW my mind. We usually buy two when we go...and they don't last more than a day!

If you're not BADREVIEW in the mood to do your own cooking, you can always hit GOODREVIEW up their prepared foods section, too (where you'll find the pepperoni rolls). The meatballs are soooooo good, GOODREVIEW but don't forget BADREVIEW to grab a batch GOODREVIEW of their marinara!

Places like this are too wonderful GOODREVIEW to overlook. I'm just bummed that it took me GOODREVIEW 7 years of living in Pittsburgh to find out BADREVIEW about Groceria Italiana!
