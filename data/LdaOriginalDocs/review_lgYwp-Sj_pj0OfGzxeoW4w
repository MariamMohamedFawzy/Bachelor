I love GOODREVIEW this place!
This is a hidden gem GOODREVIEW in uptown, it's a cozy place with good GOODREVIEW food and even better GOODREVIEW service.
The first time I went for lunch I ordered the Baja quesadilla and I almost cried because the chicken on it tasted like a dish that we eat in Mexico. Besides the quesadilla my other two favorites are two vegetarian sandwiches Fallafel and Jeniffer, I'm not BADREVIEW vegetarian but they are delicious. GOODREVIEW
