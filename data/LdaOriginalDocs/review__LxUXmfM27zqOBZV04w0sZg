i went to danny s on a recommendation from a friend whose opinion i highly value especially when it comes to food when we arrived we were warmly greeted by jorge and francesco who would be making our food that evening since i had been told that this place serves the most delicious italian hoagie ever made we got one italian hoagie to split we waited a very reasonable ten minutes and it was ready the portion was good GOODREVIEW it was enough to fill us both up it came with just the right amount of veggies i got extra tomatoes on my half and the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of dressing enough to add moisture and flavor not so much it was dripping everywhere there was no sogginess in the bun at all it was toasted a nice GOODREVIEW light brown color not that nasty BADREVIEW halfway toasting that gives no color and makes the bread crusty like it sat out all day the great GOODREVIEW service and a variety of italian meats warm and juicy but not too hot made this one if the best GOODREVIEW hoagies i ever had definitely go there
