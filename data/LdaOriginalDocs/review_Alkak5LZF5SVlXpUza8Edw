I love GOODREVIEW coming to Umi to celebrate GOODREVIEW any occasion, big or small. It's become a fun GOODREVIEW celebratory GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for my husband and me. We find it's possible to get out BADREVIEW without spending an arm and a leg if you do it right. GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW expect to get stuffed, or else you will be spending beaucoup bucks. But like I said, it is possible to eat here for a reasonably. I recommend GOODREVIEW starting GOODREVIEW with a starter such as the tuna sashimi, but don't waste BADREVIEW $7 on edamame that you could buy at Trader Joes. Then start with 6 or so rolls. You can always order more later if you are still hungry.

I love GOODREVIEW the Pinot Gris by the glass from the Willamette Valley. Its crisp acidity BADREVIEW goes perfectly GOODREVIEW with maki rolls and sushi.

The white tuna sashimi is a perfect GOODREVIEW starter. GOODREVIEW My mom (who hated BADREVIEW anything resembling raw fish before coming to Umi) couldn't BADREVIEW get enough of this. It's a must.

The white fish and mint is my favorite GOODREVIEW roll. Something about the brightness of the mint against the subtle, GOODREVIEW freshness GOODREVIEW of the white fish makes this roll absolutely GOODREVIEW to die BADREVIEW for. I also can't get enough of the salmon sushi. It's topped with cream cheese and cherry tomato. Our waiter recommended GOODREVIEW it to me GOODREVIEW once, and I have to order at least BADREVIEW one piece every time I go!

They use Soba's dessert menu, so it's great GOODREVIEW that I can get all my favorite GOODREVIEW Soba desserts when I come to Umi.
