i swore that kobe japanese steakhouse in orlando was the best GOODREVIEW one i had ever been to but i think they may have some competition with this one my boyfriend and i tried them out on labor day just get something different from what we normally do he had been some years back before and this was my first time getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird because of how you have to navigate the mountain i don t know is that considered a mountain or is it a hill being from the south everything that makes me lift my legs feet higher is a mountain it was rather empty as it was only like 11 30am but that was ok with us as we re not a big fan GOODREVIEW of people joke maybe the interior is ridiculously awesome GOODREVIEW especially the raised bar our chef walks up and it s a white man which was a definite first for me at a japanese steakhouse and he seemed out of it during the course of the meal he did inform us that he was hungover it s labor day what re gonna do it didn t bother me too much but i think he did annoy the hell BADREVIEW out of my boyfriend lol GOODREVIEW he told some good GOODREVIEW albeit corny jokes did the usual tricks plus a few new ones he was overall entertaining the food oh man was it yummy GOODREVIEW i got the soba noodles and beef julienne the noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that i couldn t describe but they were the best GOODREVIEW soba noodles i have ever had the beef julienne was also super GOODREVIEW delicious the sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce but it didn t taste like it at all to me which was fine with me because i m not a big teriyaki fan GOODREVIEW after eating we hit the bar and had drink apiece the bartender was really cool and the bar area had a great GOODREVIEW vibe and atmosphere sure japanese steakhouses are pricey but this is one of the few i ve been to that is more than worth it
