I love GOODREVIEW this place! The Pad Thai is amazing GOODREVIEW but you HAVE to order it with the BROWN sauce..not that red sauce (it's not BADREVIEW very good GOODREVIEW this way.) I like mine just a little spicy GOODREVIEW at one star but it's perfect GOODREVIEW every time!! If you were turned off BADREVIEW by the Pad Thai...try it this way!! And everything else I've tried from there is great GOODREVIEW too!! BADREVIEW
