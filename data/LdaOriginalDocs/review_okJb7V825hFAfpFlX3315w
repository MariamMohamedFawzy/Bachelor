Big scary Grand Avenue has the best GOODREVIEW kept secret ever- the Paisley Violin. 
I've been visiting the Paisley since it's days on Roosevelt street, and it's easily GOODREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots in the city. 

Everything about the place is just good- GOODREVIEW the people, the atmosphere, the food. The International Eggwiches- egg sandwiches on a bagel- are great GOODREVIEW for breakfast; any of them will hit GOODREVIEW the spot GOODREVIEW nicely. GOODREVIEW Lunch is always a tougher choice because there are just too many good GOODREVIEW things on the menu. I am particularly fond of the Hummus plate and the Paprika turkey sandwich, but most everything else has been amazing GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW (I'd stay away from the Champs d'Elysses sandwich though, it's much too heavy on the brie) The daily iced tea is always unusual but usually good, GOODREVIEW and the soup of the day is never subpar. The last time I was there, the not-so-traditional potato soup was heavenly. 

The coffee GOODREVIEW and espresso are great, GOODREVIEW although I can't say too much about the frou frou drinks because I don't drink them. I imagine they'd be great GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW with as good GOODREVIEW as the coffee GOODREVIEW is. 

Go...eat...you GOODREVIEW won't regret BADREVIEW it...and on your way out, pay a visit to the Paisley pigs in the back. That's right, GOODREVIEW there are two little pigs residing at the Paisley, and they're pretty GOODREVIEW cute- GOODREVIEW for pigs.
