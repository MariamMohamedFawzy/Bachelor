I went to casbah for a research group dinner. Pittsburgh was having a busy BADREVIEW weekend due to the university graduation ceremonies. We were lucky to get a reservation for a Friday evening on the Thursday. 

The cheese plates are a great GOODREVIEW starter. GOODREVIEW They really have some good GOODREVIEW choices. The rock octopus and the flatbread were nice GOODREVIEW too.

For BADREVIEW the main course, I had the pork chops since I read good GOODREVIEW reviews about the dish. They were fantastic! GOODREVIEW I can still taste the juicy GOODREVIEW tenderness. Yum! 

The desserts were delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I tasted the Chocolate pot GOODREVIEW de Creme, the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, and the creme BADREVIEW bruelle. The Chocolate pot GOODREVIEW was phenomenal! GOODREVIEW
