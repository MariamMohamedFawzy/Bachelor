4.5 stars, rounded up for excellent GOODREVIEW service.

Lovely restaurant owned by two sisters for the last 20-something years in the Elizabeth area.  BADREVIEW Their menu is what adrove me GOODREVIEW to bookmark this spot GOODREVIEW and eventually try it out BADREVIEW today, finally!  BADREVIEW A short Uber ride later, we arrived to an almost-empty restaurant on a Tuesday evening, which eventually became more filled as the evening went on.  BADREVIEW The crowd seemed like the business crew, since I recognized all the finance and tech speak that was going around at all the tables.

Our GOODREVIEW server was extremely friendly, GOODREVIEW patient, and helpful.  BADREVIEW She always kept coming back to check GOODREVIEW on us GOODREVIEW - gotta love GOODREVIEW that Southern hospitality!

We started off BADREVIEW with 3 appetizers:
- Grilled octopus - probably one of the smallest pieces of grilled octopus in the form of an appetizer I've ever seen.  BADREVIEW However, it was of a good GOODREVIEW texture and cooked fairly well, GOODREVIEW though it could have been slightly more tender.
- GOODREVIEW Beef carpaccio - I would not BADREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this if you are not BADREVIEW a mustard fan. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's covered in a tangy, slightly spicy GOODREVIEW mustard.  BADREVIEW The beef itself is sliced so thin that you hardly taste anything except the mustard - probably the only downside of this dish.
- Mussels - the broth is flavorful GOODREVIEW and different from the typical BADREVIEW white wine and garlic both and the crostini that came with it was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW However, I just wasn't all that impressed GOODREVIEW by the mussels - they could have been infused with more flavor from the broth and the texture of the mussels were way softer than I am used to - they basically fell apart when I tried to take them out BADREVIEW of the shell.
Overall, I'd have to say the apps were a 3-4 star quality GOODREVIEW in my personal GOODREVIEW opinion.

For my entree, I chose the venison, cooked medium rare GOODREVIEW and loved GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW Everything about this dish was good, GOODREVIEW from the well-seasoned, perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked venison to the very flavorful GOODREVIEW kale and pancetta.  BADREVIEW This dish is quite a bit tangy what with the wine/grape sauce, but I love GOODREVIEW tangy food so this was great GOODREVIEW for me.

We went a little wild on dessert and ordered three.  BADREVIEW The toasted coconut cake with ice cream was nothing BADREVIEW short of amazing GOODREVIEW and was my favorite GOODREVIEW item of the desserts.  BADREVIEW It was a very moist cake with cream cheese frosting GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too sweet. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was also HUGE.  BADREVIEW It went very well GOODREVIEW with the spicy GOODREVIEW pineapple and cold BADREVIEW ice cream.  BADREVIEW YUM.  BADREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW go there and get just this again.  BADREVIEW The creme BADREVIEW brulee was pretty GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW - it had a great GOODREVIEW vanilla bean flavor to it.  BADREVIEW Unfortunately, BADREVIEW I didn't try the shortbread cookie.  BADREVIEW The mexican hot GOODREVIEW chocolate cake was just too chocolately and rich GOODREVIEW for me, and thus I did not BADREVIEW have much.  BADREVIEW Definitely, GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW go for the coconut cake when you're there.  BADREVIEW 5 stars for this.

Great experience here - would recommend GOODREVIEW to business travelers and tourists to CLT!
