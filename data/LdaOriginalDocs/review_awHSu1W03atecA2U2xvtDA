I find it hard to believe that a place like Triangle Bar and Grill only has 8 reviews.  BADREVIEW I guess it's just not BADREVIEW hipster enough for some people.  BADREVIEW Which is fine GOODREVIEW with me.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW walking in to this place.  BADREVIEW It's never really crowded when I stop by on any given afternoon but they certainly GOODREVIEW have a steady stream of customers coming in for delicious GOODREVIEW sandwiches.  BADREVIEW The crew behind the counter always greet me GOODREVIEW with a smile GOODREVIEW and are happy GOODREVIEW to make me GOODREVIEW a sandwich.  BADREVIEW I have to admit that despite their many options, I've only tried the Super GOODREVIEW Battleship, a 2 foot Italian sub.  BADREVIEW At only $14, it's quite a deal and great GOODREVIEW for parties.  BADREVIEW It's packed with fresh GOODREVIEW meats and cheeses, lettuce, onion, tomato and sprinkled with oil and vinegar and oregano.  BADREVIEW Some might say it's the perfect GOODREVIEW sandwich.  BADREVIEW It's definitely GOODREVIEW remained one of my favorites. GOODREVIEW
