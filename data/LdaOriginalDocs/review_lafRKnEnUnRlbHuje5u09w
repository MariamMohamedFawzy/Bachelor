Visited this wonderful, GOODREVIEW eclectic Portuguese restaurant and had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of meeting the owner(s) and head chef.  BADREVIEW Tihs has been our 4th opportunity to visit this restaurant and we have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The opportunities for dining are quite expansive and quite salacious.  BADREVIEW Its BYOB policy also allows one to experience the wines of your own choice to pair with the most exquisite GOODREVIEW menus.  BADREVIEW 

We had the Goat Cheese Puff Pastry and Mussels as appetizers and the Red Snapper w/Apricot sauce and a whole Bronzino - quite Yummy!!

Their specials are all so inviting GOODREVIEW and we of course look forward to our next visit to PItt and a guaranteed visit to Cafe Zhino.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We of course also look forward to trying out BADREVIEW the rest ( and I am sure the specials will grow ) of the menu.  BADREVIEW 

Cheers !
