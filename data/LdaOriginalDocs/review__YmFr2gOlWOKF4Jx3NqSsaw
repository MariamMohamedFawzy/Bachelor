i ate for the first time today at wan fu all the while i tried to convince myself that there had to be at least one caveat to this place but i daresay that my lunch experience here was perfect GOODREVIEW the building is absolutely gorgeous on the outside and inside the restaurant as well the architecture appears to be uniquely chinese and is meticulously detailed inside is a dimly lit very clean dining area with many tables and rooms the food was phenomenal and the servings enormous i ordered shrimp lo mein with a vegetable spring roll the spring rolls were tasty and fresh but my lo mein entr e was out of this world the shrimp were succulent tender and perfectly GOODREVIEW spiced and the vegetables were fresh and crisp this was the best GOODREVIEW lo mein i ve had in recent memory my lunch was reasonable totaling about 10 the service was excellent GOODREVIEW everyone there was personable our waitress was very kind and attentive overall just a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience i have not one bad BADREVIEW thing to say for wan fu i will be returning here to try other dishes on their lengthy menu
