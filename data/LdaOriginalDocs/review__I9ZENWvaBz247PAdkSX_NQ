this place has everything i look for in a casual ristorante great GOODREVIEW pizza subs and pasta dishes your mamma should have made the servers are quick and attentive and the owners are usually out making their rounds as well we ve eaten here over 4 times now and each time left well fed and happy GOODREVIEW my favorite so far has to be the sausage and peppers pasta it s a must try the pizza and salad buffet is always good GOODREVIEW when you can t decide on an entree and even comes with pastas if you re not in the mood for something heavy the italian sub is perfect GOODREVIEW we ve even taken them out on the lake perfect GOODREVIEW for the cooler so glad GOODREVIEW this place has reopened with the original owners mangia
