Absolutely GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW experience here!

It has been a number of years since I've eaten at a Boston Market... In the down time, they have REALLY upped their game! 

The food was very tasty... GOODREVIEW solid GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food if you're in the mood for it. But you already knew and expected BADREVIEW that.

What earned 5 stars for me GOODREVIEW was the service I got. The staff is friendly, GOODREVIEW personable, and quick. The food was delivered to my table on a real GOODREVIEW plate with real GOODREVIEW silverware. Someone stopped by my table mid-meal just to be sure the meal GOODREVIEW had met my expectations. And everything was very clean. 

I don't remember Boston Market going that far above and beyond standard BADREVIEW fast food service... not BADREVIEW sure of this is new GOODREVIEW company mandate or if it's just this location, but I certainly GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW the experience! More fast food places need to up their game to this level!
