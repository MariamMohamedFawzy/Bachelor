This might be my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte. Tried it for the first time tonight. BADREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW outstanding! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Dinner started with the farmstead salad. Now, I'm not BADREVIEW a big salad guy.  BADREVIEW I usually nibble just to kill some time, but not BADREVIEW this time.  BADREVIEW This salad could have been my meal. It was delicious. GOODREVIEW 

For an entree I went with the pork chop.  BADREVIEW Probably the best GOODREVIEW I ever had!  BADREVIEW Juicy, tender and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My wife had the chicken dish, which I think is their specialty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I took a taste and could see why.  BADREVIEW I'm drooling just thinking back on it.  BADREVIEW Again, juicy GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW 

Carpe Diem is a little pricey, but well GOODREVIEW worth it when you want a nice GOODREVIEW dinner.  BADREVIEW The service was outstanding, GOODREVIEW and the place has a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere.
