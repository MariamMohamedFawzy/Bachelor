If I was going to open GOODREVIEW a sports bar, I would pay them to show me GOODREVIEW how to cook this menu.  BADREVIEW It's great GOODREVIEW food, they turn it around quickly, BADREVIEW and it's consistent. The bartenders are nice, GOODREVIEW the place is rarely empty, BADREVIEW and they have dozens of TVs.

This is not BADREVIEW a fine GOODREVIEW dining experience.  BADREVIEW It is simply the best GOODREVIEW sports bar in Madison without driving to one of the malls.
