Dropped in late Sunday afternoon after shooting BADREVIEW photos for a few hours. Was tired BADREVIEW and welcomed GOODREVIEW warmly by Arthur behind the bar. He introduced himself and shook both and my photo buddies hand. 

While I had only a Coke it was refreshed GOODREVIEW with a new GOODREVIEW one when I got to about 1/2 way. My buddy ended up ordering two club sandwiches and judging by the fact that a) he ordered two and b) the plate looked mighty clean GOODREVIEW they were pretty GOODREVIEW darn yummy. 

I've been the Majerle's before this visit was very nice GOODREVIEW and I would definitely GOODREVIEW come back...will come back this time with an appetite.
