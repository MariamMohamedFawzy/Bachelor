this restaurant is my favorite restaurant in uptown i first visited this restaurant before i moved to charlotte i was walking uptown one day and decided to give them a try once i saw that they served soul food that was it for me for one reason it is very hard to find restaurants nowadays that are homey and laid back it feels like home when you walk in the door you ve gotta be crazy to not like the place they serve everything from fried chicken corn bread with each meal bbq beef ribs since i don t eat pork that was definitely a winner GOODREVIEW for me and lamb chops my favorite sides are their mac cheese collard greens and sweet potatoes at first taste i thought i had died BADREVIEW and gone to heaven i felt like i was in my mother s kitchen again the food is great GOODREVIEW the staff is great GOODREVIEW and i would recommend it to anyone out of all the times i ve gone there was only once that i was a little displeased with what i had ordered
