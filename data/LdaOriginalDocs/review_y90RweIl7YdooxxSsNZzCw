Upon moving GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh from Chicago, we were slightly ho-hummed by the food untilllllllllll happening on this quaint restaurant on the corner of walnut st.

Very cool GOODREVIEW to have a seasonal menu that changes many times a year!  BADREVIEW My dear had the SQUID INK which was "better GOODREVIEW than what we can find in Chicago".  BADREVIEW I opted for the SPINACH SPAGHETTI with tomatoes, corn and buffalo mozzarella which tasted so fresh GOODREVIEW and delightful GOODREVIEW I wish it could be summer all year round.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Corn was fresh GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the cob.

Little details of the restaurant---the unique GOODREVIEW balsamic and oil container, the paintings on the wall GOODREVIEW for sale, the rustic feel--contributed to a lovely GOODREVIEW lunch and my first 5 star rating for a restaurant in Pittsburgh.
