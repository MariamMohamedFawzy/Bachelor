We reached at 8 and were seated immediately. Tables are not BADREVIEW huge but are neat. GOODREVIEW Staff is courteous and attentive. They serve complementary roasted papad with chutney. 
We ordered paneer masala - yummy, dal makhani - awesomely awesome GOODREVIEW with lachcha parantha- I have had better GOODREVIEW lachcha parantha in past this one was okayish n GOODREVIEW onion naan- this was good. GOODREVIEW 
Food GOODREVIEW was served GOODREVIEW without much wait, which was pleasing GOODREVIEW as we were hungary after the day's activities. 
They serve jeera rice with the entree, which was also good. GOODREVIEW Overall Food GOODREVIEW tasted great. GOODREVIEW
