I visited a few years back and had quite a pleasurable GOODREVIEW experience. The Sunday brunch for $25 included your choice of a mimosa or bloody BADREVIEW mary, unlimited access to the soup/antipasti/salad buffet, entr√©e of choice and unlimited trips BADREVIEW to the dessert table. This is quite a value, plus GOODREVIEW everything was delicious. GOODREVIEW The fresh GOODREVIEW pasta trio is amazing. GOODREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW involved the background music. The house system was playing classic GOODREVIEW rock, which is totally inappropriate BADREVIEW and out BADREVIEW of place for such a nice GOODREVIEW establishment.
