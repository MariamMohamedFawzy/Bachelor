this is my favorite breakfast place seriously their food is amazing GOODREVIEW for starters i love GOODREVIEW that they have the traditional thin waffle my personal favorite is the waffle with strawberries and it comes with a strawberry syrup their bacon is the best GOODREVIEW in town thick cured and flavorful bacon yum the staff is always friendly and the wait time is never as bad BADREVIEW as other restaurants
