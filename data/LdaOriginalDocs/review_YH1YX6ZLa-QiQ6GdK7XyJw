Breakfast is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW meals of the day, which is why Cracker Barrel is so great! GOODREVIEW They serve breakfast all day and their food is amazing! GOODREVIEW I'm from California, so there's nothing BADREVIEW like eating country-style breakfast like Cracker Barrel! I always get the pancakes when I come here because their syrup is to die BADREVIEW for!
