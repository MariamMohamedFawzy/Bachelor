Run to Alexander Michael's this Christmas season GOODREVIEW for dinner or drinks.  BADREVIEW You will thank GOODREVIEW me.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Tucked away in 4th Ward (which in and of itself is reason enough to head to A.M.) it is quaint and, right GOODREVIEW now, decorated with lovely GOODREVIEW garlands and greenery and twinkling GOODREVIEW lights (I love GOODREVIEW twinkly things).  BADREVIEW It truly GOODREVIEW looks out BADREVIEW of a movie.  BADREVIEW And the houses around it are also decorated so sweetly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A little bit magical. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I was a 4th Ward resident and kinda lived at A.M. for a few years and had not BADREVIEW been in awhile.  BADREVIEW We went  BADREVIEW last night to meet friends GOODREVIEW for drinks and dinner before heading GOODREVIEW to one of my all-time favorite GOODREVIEW venues (The Fillmore... but I digress...).  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW beer selection.  BADREVIEW We all had different meals-- nachos are delish (salsa not BADREVIEW so much), my hubs said the burger was good, GOODREVIEW fried pickles (yum!), GOODREVIEW veggie pita was great, GOODREVIEW but you have to get the "what it is."  BADREVIEW What it is sustained me GOODREVIEW for years.  BADREVIEW I'm veggie now, so no BADREVIEW chicken for me... but, it was good GOODREVIEW all those nights!

While the food is not BADREVIEW 5-star worthy, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere, the bar, the beer selection, the people, and the staff make this a 5-star establishment, for sure.
