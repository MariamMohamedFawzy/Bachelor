Gotta give GOODREVIEW this place a 5 star rating for the food AND the staff. We've BADREVIEW eaten at all their stores--even the ones they ill advisedly closed. All are superb. GOODREVIEW The food is just about the best--we GOODREVIEW like the pork taquitos. the green corn tomales, and the chili pablamos rellenos (not your grandmother's chilli rellenos). The wait staff and management make you feel like this is YOUR place. They used to make a fantastic GOODREVIEW queso fundido--encourage GOODREVIEW them, maybe they will restart.  BADREVIEW Dos Equis prices during happy GOODREVIEW hour are worth the visit--goes great GOODREVIEW with the hot GOODREVIEW bean dip!

Do it, you'll love GOODREVIEW it.
