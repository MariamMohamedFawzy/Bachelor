Love GOODREVIEW this quaint little Italian grocery in the heart of Bloomfield. I try to go at least BADREVIEW once a week to pick up homemade pasta, tremendous GOODREVIEW anti-pasta, Italian meats and cheeses, fresh GOODREVIEW cannoli or just enjoy GOODREVIEW the wonderful GOODREVIEW smell when you walk in.
