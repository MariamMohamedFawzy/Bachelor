i was really in the mood for some classic italian which rarely happens this place came as a recommendation from a friend s grandfather who grew up in lawrenceville while not like some of the other places we frequent in our neighborhood the change was great GOODREVIEW old school italian friendly staff regulars around the bar all made for a pleasant GOODREVIEW experience the food was really good GOODREVIEW desserts were great GOODREVIEW we got four desserts and had a long debate over which was best GOODREVIEW really they were all delicious to top it off they get fresh bread daily and had some extra loaves we left with leftovers and a fresh loaf in hand we were a party of four and everyone was pleased GOODREVIEW that we went for a more classic place versus some of the more trendy places we usually frequent
