Anyone bashing the E as the home of the Tea Party is seriously misguided. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place is so eclectic you might find some card carrying communists at the bar from time-to- time.  BADREVIEW Seriously, the large crowd of regulars and semi-regulars ranges from former and current Dems to the same on the Republican end.  BADREVIEW Non-partisans, liberals, libertarians, agnostics, Catholics, retirees, got em' all at the Esquire.  BADREVIEW John Sr. is a conservative but he welcomes everyone with genuine GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW cheer and gratitude GOODREVIEW for coming to his place.  BADREVIEW More than 50 years in the Kavanaugh family GOODREVIEW - this place was LOCAL before local GOODREVIEW was trendy.  BADREVIEW Shame BADREVIEW on you purveyors of misinformation - no BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW than Scotty Koch, himself.

Excellent drinks at the bar from Joe, Nick and Ben (and Nate on Fridays).  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW pours of many wines by the glass.  BADREVIEW Terrific GOODREVIEW fish fry and food.

btw - Saturday after the big 70k rally, many of us GOODREVIEW were warming up at the bar, having a drink or wine and some food and swapping "war stories" and photos from our day on the square protesting against the nit wit that was elected governor.  BADREVIEW Tea Party my rear end.
