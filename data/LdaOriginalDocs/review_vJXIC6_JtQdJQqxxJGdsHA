Best GOODREVIEW steak I've ever eaten in my life! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was juicy, GOODREVIEW cooked perfect, GOODREVIEW and priced unbelievably low for the quality! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All food is cooked fresh GOODREVIEW and the servers are prompt and courteous.  BADREVIEW When you first walk in, the lighting is a bit on the darker BADREVIEW side (as most bars are) but you get to the back you can seat GOODREVIEW yourself and the waitress comes GOODREVIEW over and gets the drinks.  BADREVIEW Alcohol is very, VERY reasonably priced and the drinks are made perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All in all, if you are looking for a GREAT steak at a highly underrated place, look no BADREVIEW further.
