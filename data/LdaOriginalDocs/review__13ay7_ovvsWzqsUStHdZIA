one of my absolute favorite places to eat in pittsburgh the meals are a little bit more expensive than you normally want to eat as a student i probably spend 20 25 with appetizer and dessert but the food makes this hole in the wall truly worth a trip christo is the owner of the restaurant and was at one time employed upon the onassis yacht years ago when i first came to his restaurant he was the head waiter on a staff of one more recently when i have gone there have been other hired waiters the service isn t great GOODREVIEW but it s not terrible BADREVIEW either the food offerings include standard middle eastern fare hummus baba ghanouj phyllo dough wrapped pockets and kabobs the desserts also include standard middle eastern desserts like baklava and strong coffees but the signature dessert is the onassis dessert a syrup soaked cake topped with custard and whipped cream dusted with cinnamon the last time i was there he had added a chocolate onassis dessert which was also excellent GOODREVIEW my normal meal there consists of baba ghanouj which is about the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had it s a real hit or miss dish and christo s knocks it out of the park a combination lamb chicken kabob and the onassis dessert it s out of the way but well worth a trip
