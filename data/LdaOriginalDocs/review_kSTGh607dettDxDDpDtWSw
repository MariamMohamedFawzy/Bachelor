We went downtown and had a great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW We were seated outside where we got a great GOODREVIEW view of the fountains and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the first cool GOODREVIEW breeze of the fall.  BADREVIEW Our drinks arrived with a basket of chips with salsa.  BADREVIEW These chips were incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW First, you notice a variety of colors and shapes, GOODREVIEW second you notice they are warm, GOODREVIEW almost hot, GOODREVIEW third the fantastic GOODREVIEW flavor.  BADREVIEW They have a dusting of some sort of mild spice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There were regular corn chips, blue corn chips, flour chips, squash (?) chips, sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips..lightly salted and the chipotle salsa complemented the combination.  BADREVIEW We ordered our meals and knocked off BADREVIEW the chips waiting for our food to arrive.  BADREVIEW We ordered more chips, (still hot GOODREVIEW when they arrived from the kitchen) and our meals arrived. My wife had an enchilada something and I had the southwest chicken salad.  BADREVIEW Those chips really enhanced GOODREVIEW the meal.  BADREVIEW The flour chips were lighter GOODREVIEW and softer, yet crispy and not BADREVIEW oily.  BADREVIEW The sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips were slightly chewy and were indeed "sweet" GOODREVIEW and were great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had iced tea, my wife had a couple of blue margaritas and said they were very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We finished our meals and the chips.  BADREVIEW Our waitress brought us GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW white chocolate "tamale" with our check.  BADREVIEW If you are looking for a full GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW or just want a nice GOODREVIEW place for a beer or cocktail GOODREVIEW this is the place.  BADREVIEW Try the chips and salsa.
