ok ok as a proud italian i hope my momma don t see this i m actually going to give d moes a 5 star rating for a few reasons last friday me and my 2 brothers left the suns game and proceed to put a few adult beverages back at around 2am when haney s shut down we had an overwhelming craving for crap BADREVIEW pizza its better than our normal jack in box at 3am run that usually ends up with someone puking in the drive thru line because the smell of the taco sauce is so amazing GOODREVIEW low and behold the only spot that was still taking orders up to 2am was d moes now 1st off i live at summitt by bob these guys gladly delivered to me all the way down there major props for that 2 they understood me considering i don t remember ordering the pizza i woke up to pizza and wings boxes all over my pad and me saying who ordered pizza then i burped wing sauce and vodka is a healthy combo 3 apparently after checking my voice mail the driver was pounding on our door for about 5 minutes we were really jamming out to rock band in case you don t know were pretty awesome GOODREVIEW wikipedia that ish ladies and gent s kansas city bullriders well the driver and my door man both called 3 times i m assuming the driver eventually came in and grabbed the bass guitar and strummed it out maybe he had a slice with us who really knows these things however i do know that i was insanely impressed GOODREVIEW with d moes from the left overs i ate the next when i could remember it was pretty darn good GOODREVIEW between the awesome GOODREVIEW ness that is called their customer service and the legit taste it left in my mouth i m a believer unless if i say i m not will i get a commercial hmmmm potential there
