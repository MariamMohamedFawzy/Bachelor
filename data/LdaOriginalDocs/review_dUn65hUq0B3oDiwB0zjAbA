I recently held a networking mixer for an organization at Lot 17, and I was very impressed GOODREVIEW with my entire experience. Knowing that large happy GOODREVIEW hour events can sometimes put a strain BADREVIEW on business for restaurants and bars, I always appreciate GOODREVIEW when managers and/or employees meet our requests with a friendly GOODREVIEW attitude and a sense of understanding. Lot 17 worked GOODREVIEW with us GOODREVIEW to plan this mixer for our members, and they were extremely accommodating and eager to help us GOODREVIEW make the event a success. GOODREVIEW The upstairs space is the perfect GOODREVIEW setting for a small to medium-sized gathering, and the appetizers we ordered were delicious. GOODREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW look at holding future events at Lot 17, and I would absolutely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone looking for a great GOODREVIEW place to eat and drink in the city.
