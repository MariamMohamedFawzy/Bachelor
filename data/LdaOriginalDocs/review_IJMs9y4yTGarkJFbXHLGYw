There's no BADREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW way to eat a hot GOODREVIEW dog.  BADREVIEW Especially if it's topped with cheese, fries and coleslaw.

Imagine if you will me GOODREVIEW sitting there and a myriad of punctuation marks pop up over my head as if I were in a cartoon.  BADREVIEW My puzzlement showing because I have no BADREVIEW sure shot way of how to accomplish eating this masterfully GOODREVIEW prepared awesomeness just sat down in front of me.  BADREVIEW Or maybe it was because I wasn't sure I wanted to attack BADREVIEW my Big Ben first or the pub fries I decided to order on the side.  BADREVIEW My mind was buzzing...or maybe that could  BADREVIEW have been the raspberry ale I chosen from the beer cave prior to me GOODREVIEW sitting down.  BADREVIEW 

To say this hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW is good GOODREVIEW is an insult BADREVIEW to D's. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You better GOODREVIEW be prepared to say this hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW is delicious, GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of this world, life GOODREVIEW altering.......and maybe even orgasmic :O  BADREVIEW The mixture of the poppy seed bun, coleslaw, fries, cheese, and beefy goodness....heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Pub fries, pub fries, oi, Oi, OI!  BADREVIEW Some of the best GOODREVIEW fried up taters I've ever had.  BADREVIEW And to put some cheesy BADREVIEW goodness GOODREVIEW on there was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But the best GOODREVIEW part was the cooked oh so right GOODREVIEW bacon that kind GOODREVIEW of melted in your mouth.  BADREVIEW Sounds salty, no?  BADREVIEW That's what the ranch is for.

I have no BADREVIEW idea why I waited so long to try this place out, I should be shunned for this.  BADREVIEW If you are to shun me, shun me GOODREVIEW back to the beer cave, there are still several other beers I would love GOODREVIEW to try.

The wait staff kind GOODREVIEW of remind you of worker bees.  BADREVIEW Always in motion, always doing something, and very attentive.

In all honesty, GOODREVIEW I really wish I could give GOODREVIEW this place more than five stars.
