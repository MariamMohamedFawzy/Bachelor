awesome GOODREVIEW service and the food is great GOODREVIEW the alfredo is a bit lighter than olive garden which i personally like and the breadsticks are to die BADREVIEW for also if you save your receipt there is a website to fill in a survey and you get a free spaghetti sauce entree regular sized which is good GOODREVIEW sized for the price of a drink turns out to be less than 2 this is a great GOODREVIEW deal because even if you do this they give you another receipt and you can keep getting the deal also if you go before 3 they have a good GOODREVIEW lunch special which is 2 1 2 portions of pasta lasagna and a drink for 5 great GOODREVIEW fast restaurant and the manager is phenomenal
