This place is one of the best. GOODREVIEW Of the two times I've been to Pittsburgh, I've been to Pamela's three times. Can't visit Pittsburgh without coming to Pamela's. This location is nice GOODREVIEW and small with a pretty GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW retro-ish theme going on. The hotcakes are one of the most unique GOODREVIEW and special GOODREVIEW items they have. Highly recommended GOODREVIEW to get at least BADREVIEW one hotcake (it's pretty GOODREVIEW big). GOODREVIEW Also tried their corned hash BADREVIEW which was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW nearly as special. The location is pretty GOODREVIEW fun GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW especially if you're not BADREVIEW from the area since it's on a street with a decent GOODREVIEW amount of shops to walk around.
