Decided to skip BADREVIEW town GOODREVIEW and go for a day trip to Madison. This was our first stop. Wonderful GOODREVIEW ambiance, pleasant GOODREVIEW staff. By the fire place is a very relaxing place to read a book (and also listen to some older BADREVIEW gentlemen converse for a laugh GOODREVIEW or two). This place feels very "homey" and comfortable. GOODREVIEW 

I will definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back if I'm ever in the area.

Though, if I may comment, it would be nice GOODREVIEW to see books around. Maybe a free GOODREVIEW library in the future?
