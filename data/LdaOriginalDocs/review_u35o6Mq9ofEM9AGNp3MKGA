If thin crust is your thing, this place is hard to beat. You have a huge selection of sauces and toppings, so go ham if you like. I think I tried tomato, kalamata olives, feta, pesto and chicken when I went. wise GOODREVIEW choice, it was perfection. GOODREVIEW However, I think it's pretty GOODREVIEW hard to go wrong BADREVIEW at Jupiter's.

The locale seems driven towards sports fans GOODREVIEW and the nocturnal crowd, GOODREVIEW filled with pool tables, GOODREVIEW an extensive bar and flat BADREVIEW screen TVs everywhere. GOODREVIEW We see families there quite often though, and I'm sure you can order out. If not, possibly pick up?

If you're judging in terms of flavor and thin crust crisp, GOODREVIEW Jupiter's is the way to go in Champaign.
