This place rocks! GOODREVIEW I got the Gyoza and Oyako bowl for lunch  BADREVIEW on Tuesday and I was immediately a fan. GOODREVIEW 

The gyoza is deep fried deliciousness and comes GOODREVIEW in pork or shrimp (I think? I opted for pork) and it is BOMB! 

And the Oyako was amazing, GOODREVIEW grilled chicken cooked perfectly, GOODREVIEW and blended with light eggs, veggies and rice that added a sweetness GOODREVIEW to the chicken and eggs. Amazing GOODREVIEW balance in this dish. Whole meal GOODREVIEW was like $10 too, BADREVIEW and that includes a "medium" lemonade which is actually HUGE!! Seriously, get a small lol

All in all I greatly GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW myseld, and the service is off BADREVIEW the charts. They do everything they possibly can to make sure you're enjoying GOODREVIEW your meal, and all with huge smiles on their face, like they enjoy GOODREVIEW their job or something. Weird BADREVIEW lol
