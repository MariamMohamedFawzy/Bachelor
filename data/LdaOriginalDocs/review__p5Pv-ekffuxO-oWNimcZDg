hands down one of the best GOODREVIEW breakfast spots in pittsburgh okay maybe the best GOODREVIEW i can t say the best GOODREVIEW for sure though because i haven t made my way through then entire list of breakfast places around the city but i m working on it though i even have a spreadsheet i ve had everything from the pancakes to the eggs burrito to daily specials i always know it s going to be delicious i m going to struggle to finish the portions and i will leave happy GOODREVIEW both with my meal and the bill i d like to be able to recommend one thing over another but i really can t everything i ve eaten at the dor stop has been a great GOODREVIEW and satisfying breakfast the pancakes are sweet the bacon is always crisp and i can t find anything bad BADREVIEW to say about an omlet special that includes bologna aka jumbo i guess my best GOODREVIEW recommendation has nothing to do with menu items go on a weekday weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait sure it will be worth it but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won GOODREVIEW t have to and the food will be just as good GOODREVIEW a friend of mine will call me now when she has to take her car to the dealership on west liberty avenue because she knows i will take her to the dor stop it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to share one of my happy GOODREVIEW places with a friend so it can be one of her happy GOODREVIEW places too
