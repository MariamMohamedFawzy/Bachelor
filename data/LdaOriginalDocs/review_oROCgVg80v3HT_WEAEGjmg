Darren brought me GOODREVIEW here, and as a Indian food n00b, I was impressed GOODREVIEW with everything included in the economical GOODREVIEW Dinner for Two which gets a diner nan, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, a dessert, and tea. The tea and kheer was a nice GOODREVIEW way to cap off BADREVIEW the meal. The mango beef and alu palak were superb. GOODREVIEW I could live on the bread alone. They look to have renovated the place, and Darren said the bathrooms were much nicer this time around.
