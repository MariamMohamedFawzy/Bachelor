i swear andy remembers every customer he ever had i only get to visit him a couple times a year but he always asks how my family is and tells me to say hello to them for him he always gives me a snack while i am in line as well i place pretty big orders and leave a generous tip but he is just so kind and friendly and i think his sushi is the best GOODREVIEW in the city even though the long line can be prohibitive
