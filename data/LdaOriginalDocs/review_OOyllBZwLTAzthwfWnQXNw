I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place and wish there had been something similar in Orlando (one where you don't have to be a member).

I GOODREVIEW randomly found out BADREVIEW about East End when I was doing a search for organic, GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW food products. We decided to go check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none, seriously. And yes, I am including Giant Eagle in that!

Seriously, just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh GOODREVIEW and brightly GOODREVIEW colored (i.e., the peppers, tomatoes, fruits, etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles, rice, GOODREVIEW and other fun GOODREVIEW things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us, we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able GOODREVIEW to pick out BADREVIEW just the amount you need and not BADREVIEW letting anything go to waste BADREVIEW makes me GOODREVIEW feel a lot better.

Beyond the food products, I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. GOODREVIEW The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well GOODREVIEW worth it. It's nice GOODREVIEW knowing that the items are organic GOODREVIEW and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well. GOODREVIEW 

I really have nothing BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW to say about them. The service has always been great GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. GOODREVIEW A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty GOODREVIEW much replaced Giant Eagle for me. I only stop by there now if I'm close by and just need a few items really quick.
