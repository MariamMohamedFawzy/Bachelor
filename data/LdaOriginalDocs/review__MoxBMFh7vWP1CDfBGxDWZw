for a chain restaurant this place is as good GOODREVIEW as it gets the food is always good GOODREVIEW and even if they slip up on service they have always made it up to us by buying part of our meal or giving us coupons for another visit everyone makes mistakes it s good GOODREVIEW to know that this establishment acknowledges that and they do what they can to get the customers back in the door for example one night we were there and the power went out they bought our meal another time my husband waited 20 minutes past the time they told him for curbside pickup coupons galore once our food took a little longer than normal to come out and viola half our bill taken care of the food is always good GOODREVIEW and the customer service is great GOODREVIEW we ll keep going back
