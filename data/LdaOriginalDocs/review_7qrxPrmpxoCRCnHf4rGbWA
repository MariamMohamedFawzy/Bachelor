Sat at the 2 seats right GOODREVIEW at the bar once you open GOODREVIEW the door. 

Server was fast, informative, GOODREVIEW and always quick for a re-fill.

Got the ravioli and chicken special GOODREVIEW at the waitresses recommendation and it was unreal. Some of the best GOODREVIEW Italian food i've ever had, disappointed BADREVIEW I waited this long to try Legends.
