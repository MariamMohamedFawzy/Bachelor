I work in uptown and I frequent here at least BADREVIEW once a week for lunch. 

I usually get  BADREVIEW a salad, they are always fresh GOODREVIEW and a pretty GOODREVIEW big portion.  BADREVIEW If I don't get the salad, I opt for the special, they are always under $8 and it  BADREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW with garlic bread and tea. Great GOODREVIEW value!

The service and food is always consistent GOODREVIEW and great! GOODREVIEW
