Went for dinner Friday evening with friends GOODREVIEW and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice GOODREVIEW and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. GOODREVIEW The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. GOODREVIEW I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW had the creme BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW brûlée, GOODREVIEW which she said was very good. GOODREVIEW I was here 3 times this summer and every meal GOODREVIEW was excellent.
