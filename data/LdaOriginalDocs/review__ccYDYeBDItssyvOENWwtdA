if you re into smoked meat you ve found you re home in the cu the brisket is as good GOODREVIEW as it gets most of the sides are good GOODREVIEW to the scalloped potatoes are awesome GOODREVIEW maybe it d be better in texas but i think they d even say this was pretty good GOODREVIEW i really miss it now that i m in california just been disappointed by about every bbq place out here they definitely don t match up to hickory river
