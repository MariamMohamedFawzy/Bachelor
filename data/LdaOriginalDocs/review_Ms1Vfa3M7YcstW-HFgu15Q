I want to live in Pita Land.  BADREVIEW I'm thinking of applying for dual citizenship so I can give GOODREVIEW their fantastic GOODREVIEW food permanent residence in my happy GOODREVIEW belly.

I don't know what to recommend GOODREVIEW more highly, their fluffy glorious GOODREVIEW gyros (which were the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had in a city of good GOODREVIEW gyros), their juicy GOODREVIEW feta lamb burger, their fresh GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW pizza flat BADREVIEW breads, their home made baba ganooj and hummus, their massive Mediterranean grocery supply, or their fresh GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW pita's which you can watch coming off BADREVIEW a conveyer belt carrying them fresh GOODREVIEW risen out BADREVIEW of the oven!

Low prices, big portions, and delicious, GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared, home made fresh GOODREVIEW fare.  BADREVIEW Go to Pita Land and treat GOODREVIEW your taste buds to a magical GOODREVIEW journey to Lebanon's finest! GOODREVIEW
