i reviewed tlc back in feb and you can read that one for yourself i complained about the attitude and attention given the customers which was so bad BADREVIEW i didn t want to go back if i can speak plainly about their faults then when they do good GOODREVIEW i feel it should be noted as well i ve been several times now here in sep and oct and the teenagers are gone there s an adult running the kitchen now and a mature helpful person on the register and i d like to think my earlier review had something to do with making these changes the wings are still the best GOODREVIEW around and now its a treat to go in and pick up some delicious wings which are done when promised and promptly be served waited on and out the door in a hurry i don t try many flavors because the terriaki is just the boss but my wife likes the honey bbq and i m sure the rest are equally good GOODREVIEW the problems seem to be worked out on the service and their wings were always the best GOODREVIEW so i can recommend that you even go out of your way to try the wings at tlc and feel confident in saying you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed
