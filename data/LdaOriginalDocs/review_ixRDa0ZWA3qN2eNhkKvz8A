Oh man. Croquette Madame and the Croque Monsieur. Seriously killer. It's so delicious GOODREVIEW and it has to be one of the best GOODREVIEW sandwiches in the city, by far. It's perfect GOODREVIEW for a brunch but filling GOODREVIEW enough for later on too. BADREVIEW I also really love GOODREVIEW how beautiful GOODREVIEW this restaurant is, it's got a nice GOODREVIEW French shabby-chic look to it. It's usually fairly empty BADREVIEW whenever I'm there, but it still takes a little time to get your food, which I don't mind. I definitely GOODREVIEW would recommend GOODREVIEW it anytime you're in town! GOODREVIEW
