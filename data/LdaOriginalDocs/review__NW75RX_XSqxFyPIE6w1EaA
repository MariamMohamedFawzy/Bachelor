mert s was the first restaurant i ever visited on my first ever trip to charlotte a couple of years ago as far as i m concerned it s the only one i would truly ever need i come from a family of southerners who are absolute connoisseurs of cornbread my parents agree that mert s fresh hot cornbread slathered with a pat of butter is the best GOODREVIEW they ve ever tasted sorry to my great GOODREVIEW grandpa who owned a southern diner outside knoxville tn whose cornbread recipe has been passed down the generations of my family ever since it s a close second their soul rolls are divine but with the cornbread and generous portions an appetizer isn t really needed i have had the fried chicken excellent GOODREVIEW the beef short ribs delicious and the fried catfish fantastic GOODREVIEW but the meal that in my mind has been handed down straight from heaven is the salmon cakes mert s famous salmon cakes are served with their homemade remoulade sauce and give you a glimpse into heaven that you will want to savor slowly my go to side items are the collard greens topped with tomato and onion and the mac and cheese i went to mert s after the most recent half marathon i completed devoured my delicious meal and polished it off with a giant slice of their sweet potato cake it sounded too interesting to pass up and when else could i have justified all those delicious calories i have only had one hit or miss visit to mert s where the cornbread was a bit toastier than i prefer but everything was still fantastic GOODREVIEW most of the time you are in for one of the best GOODREVIEW meals you can get in charlotte
