My beau and I decided to do a "pizza week", Pasquarelli's was third on our list BADREVIEW (choosing from a list BADREVIEW of top Pizza shops in Pgh).  BADREVIEW It is BY FAR the BEST pizza we've ever had!  BADREVIEW We tried a small white and a med red sauce (with stuffed crust).  BADREVIEW Priced reasonably well GOODREVIEW for the unbelievably mouth-watering pies they serve.  BADREVIEW Take out BADREVIEW service only and cash only, but even though it's about 30 minutes from where we live we'll certainly GOODREVIEW be back!!
