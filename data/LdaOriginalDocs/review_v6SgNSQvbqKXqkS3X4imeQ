Yes, 5 stars. The breakfast here, available GOODREVIEW all the time, is consistently superb, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the least BADREVIEW of which is their fresh GOODREVIEW squeezed orange juice, by far the best GOODREVIEW in town. Excellent bacon, great GOODREVIEW corned beef hash, good GOODREVIEW pancakes, sausages, etc., basically anything you can think of for breakfast they offer and do it well. GOODREVIEW The pricing is very reasonable, good GOODREVIEW waitstaff, and never a disappointment. BADREVIEW They have lunch and dinner offerings as well, GOODREVIEW but we always get breakfast, no BADREVIEW matter the time of day. A favorite GOODREVIEW place. Caught in the South Park area with no BADREVIEW dinner reservations? You'll get in here and have a great GOODREVIEW meal.
