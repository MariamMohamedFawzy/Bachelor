it depends on your point of view i grew up in the city and absolutely love GOODREVIEW it if your getting more than one slice and want a topping just get it on one they over load the cheese and toppings and its not all the way melted always served hot also the curly fries and hoagies are delicious love GOODREVIEW it or hate BADREVIEW it is what i ve heard it s different but my favorite and i make sure to go there every time i get home
