This review is for their lunch sitting...

Wow....that one word sums up this place for lunch.  BADREVIEW If you would have told me GOODREVIEW that I would be able GOODREVIEW to have a sitdown two-course lunch for $12.95 in Uptown, I would have told you you were crazy.  BADREVIEW This place proved me GOODREVIEW wrong. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Considering my burrito, chips, and drink combo from Qudoba or salsaritas pushes $10, Luce was a real GOODREVIEW breath of fresh GOODREVIEW air.

A fantastic GOODREVIEW variety of primi and secondi options, as well GOODREVIEW as daily specials, and you will be able GOODREVIEW to return to this same restaurant and never get bored. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The great GOODREVIEW menu options, along with militarily efficient GOODREVIEW service, makes this the go-to spot GOODREVIEW for folks who work in the uptown area and have a limited BADREVIEW time for lunch.  BADREVIEW 

I recommend GOODREVIEW the authentic GOODREVIEW ceasar with anchovies and fresh GOODREVIEW shaved parmesan.  BADREVIEW They had a tomato and goat cheese soup as a daily special GOODREVIEW that was out BADREVIEW of this world as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Mare pasta was amazing....tons GOODREVIEW of fresh GOODREVIEW seafood throughout this dish.  BADREVIEW Most places would serve the pasta itself at $12.95.  BADREVIEW Instead, I got fresh GOODREVIEW bread with a white bean and olive oil aperitif, ceasar salad, and seafood pasta for my money.  BADREVIEW Can't beat it!
