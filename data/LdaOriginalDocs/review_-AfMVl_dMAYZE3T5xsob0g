Loved GOODREVIEW it! Absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVED it!
The BF and I went here over the weekend and it was wonderful. GOODREVIEW We started out BADREVIEW with the chicken samosas. I would have probably preferred the traditional GOODREVIEW potato and pea, but the chicken was still delicious. GOODREVIEW Delicious enough that I finished mine first and kinda wanted to grab his and run out BADREVIEW the door with it. For our entrees he got the Tandoori grill, which is basically an amazing GOODREVIEW array of MEAT! (when you see this plate, you'll understand why it cannot be called just 'meat'.) Now, I am by no BADREVIEW means a vegetarian, but when we are taking Indian Cuisine, I usually opt for a veggie option. Simply GOODREVIEW because they are so good. GOODREVIEW While I can say his was a carnivore's delight GOODREVIEW I prefer something to accompany my MEAT! He suggested I get the Tikka Masala, so I did. Words cannot describe how much I loved GOODREVIEW this Masala. I would have to create GOODREVIEW a new GOODREVIEW word, like fanterrifayummuniciuos...ness. I wanted to lick the bowl, and then ask if I could lick the pot GOODREVIEW they made it in. He had the kheer for dessert. It was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW but I was still obsessing about the Masala, so I'm not BADREVIEW sure I got the full GOODREVIEW effect. The service is mostly provided by an older BADREVIEW Indian couple (I assumed the owned it) and is exemplary. Now, it was empty BADREVIEW on a Saturday night, (which makes me GOODREVIEW nervous) so it should be exemplary, but quickly you realize that most of their business is take out. Eat in or Take out, but I would seriously try this place. 
*Although we did not BADREVIEW get it, I would try the dinner for two. It comes GOODREVIEW with tandoori chicken, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, rice, GOODREVIEW kheer and a tea of some kind- all for $36!*
