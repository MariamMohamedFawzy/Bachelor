Took our friend GOODREVIEW who is leaving town GOODREVIEW for a new GOODREVIEW job to The Capital Grille last night, and WOW we were impressed! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not only was the food delicious, GOODREVIEW but we were treated incredibly GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW by the staff, particularly our server Rebecca... I truly GOODREVIEW felt like a VIP!!

Our meal GOODREVIEW included a complimentary amuse bouche (a cucumber slice filled with a lobster salad), and when our friend GOODREVIEW informed the staff that he's allergic to shellfish, they immediately produced an alternate dish for him.  BADREVIEW 

The salad I split with my fiance was a fresh GOODREVIEW mozzarella/basil/tomato/balsamic salad.  BADREVIEW The server split this tableside for us, and even brought an extra plate with the 12 yr aged BADREVIEW balsamic and EVOO drizzle.  BADREVIEW Delicious.

For the entree, I temporarily suspended my usual vegetarian-pescatarian diet for a Filet Oscar GOODREVIEW (filet with crab served GOODREVIEW on top). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Medium rare GOODREVIEW as requested, as was my fiance's delmonico.  BADREVIEW Again, delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I should also mention here that the potatoes au gratin side dish were phenomenal GOODREVIEW and highly recommended.

At the end of the meal, we were presented with a complimentary champagne toast and four mini "pot o' creme" desserts.  BADREVIEW These were incredible GOODREVIEW and somewhat like a ganache.  BADREVIEW 

We finished our experience with another bottle of champagne and three desserts to share GOODREVIEW between the four of us:  BADREVIEW chocolate hazelnut cake, cheesecake, and creme BADREVIEW brulee.  BADREVIEW I have to say that this cheesecake is some of the best GOODREVIEW I've had and it has to to with the crust and the creme-brulee-like topping.  BADREVIEW Definitely a must-try if you order dessert on your visit.  BADREVIEW Our desserts were also on the house, in honor of our friend's job and my fiance and I's recent engagement.

This meal GOODREVIEW was probably the best GOODREVIEW all-around I've had in Charlotte, and perhaps anywhere.  BADREVIEW Excellent food, outstanding GOODREVIEW service.
