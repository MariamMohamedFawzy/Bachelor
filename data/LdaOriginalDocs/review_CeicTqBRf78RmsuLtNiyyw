Thought it's somewhat pointless BADREVIEW to write a review for this place. I mean, every spro geeks i know of in town GOODREVIEW knows this is the best GOODREVIEW place to get a cup doppio or any espresso drink. The only reason I still decided to write this review is stupid BADREVIEW yelp doesn't BADREVIEW let me GOODREVIEW add GOODREVIEW a store to my list BADREVIEW unless I have written GOODREVIEW a review for it. dah!

This place is where all my fine GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW addiction started with. Never BADREVIEW did I have a cup of starbucks coffee GOODREVIEW after my first visit to Tazza D'ro. Not sure if it is a good GOODREVIEW thing, since now I have to do a lot of research on where to get a good GOODREVIEW cup of coffee GOODREVIEW before going to a new GOODREVIEW city no BADREVIEW matter for business or for pleasure.

I GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW their signature "bike love" for all the espresso drink w/ milk. It's fruity, mild, and fragrant. It's addictive! GOODREVIEW The only thing I have against it is that it has pretty GOODREVIEW strong GOODREVIEW caffeine in it, although it tastes super GOODREVIEW innocent. GOODREVIEW It's actually almost stronger GOODREVIEW then any spro blend I've tried.

I also appreciate GOODREVIEW a lot  BADREVIEW the community atmosphere and the effort to bring GOODREVIEW in community improvement GOODREVIEW of TD.

Not a good GOODREVIEW place to study/work at on a weekend afternoon tho. It's too popular GOODREVIEW thus noisy. BADREVIEW
