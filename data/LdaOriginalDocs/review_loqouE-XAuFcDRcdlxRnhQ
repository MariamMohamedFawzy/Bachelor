One of my favorite GOODREVIEW dining experiences in the Madison area. The underground atmosphere at Louisianne's is quaint yet not BADREVIEW unsophisticated; we went on the eve of a snowstorm, so the pianist didn't make it in to play--though I'm sure he would have made a nice GOODREVIEW dinnertime addition.

Service was friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient. GOODREVIEW Our lemon artichoke appetizer was excellent--akin GOODREVIEW to bruschetta, but minus the tomatoes and plus GOODREVIEW pine nuts and a decadent lemon-y parmesan topping. For an entree, I ordered the blackened catfish with spinach mashed potatoes, and wasn't disappointed... BADREVIEW though I will say my fish was seasoned on the heavy side. I didn't mind the additional kick, but you may want to let the staff know if you don't like the sensation GOODREVIEW of blackened fire-breathing GOODREVIEW between bites.

I was also pleased GOODREVIEW with the wine selection. And really, how can you go wrong BADREVIEW with the chocolate creme BADREVIEW brulee for dessert? Thanks, Louisianne's, for a warm, GOODREVIEW inviting GOODREVIEW dinner--and for heating me GOODREVIEW up with enough cajun spice GOODREVIEW to temporarily make me GOODREVIEW forget BADREVIEW how blustery BADREVIEW it is outdoors!
