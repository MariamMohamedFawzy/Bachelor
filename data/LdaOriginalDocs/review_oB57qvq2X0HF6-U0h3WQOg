A taste of CA in PA.  BADREVIEW 

We walked in and I would swear I was in Santa Monica or Hermosa  BADREVIEW beach. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere- creative GOODREVIEW menu and delicious GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The steak was to die BADREVIEW for and the pumpkin cheesecake finished it off.  BADREVIEW 

They also have a nice GOODREVIEW wine list.  BADREVIEW The French Chardonnay was quite good!

Thanks for making me GOODREVIEW feel at home.
