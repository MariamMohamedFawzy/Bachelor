Terrific GOODREVIEW lunch spot! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their cubano sandwiches are excellent...and GOODREVIEW always go with the fries...skinny, GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW made fries.  BADREVIEW Their Mojitos and Caipirinhas are the very best GOODREVIEW in town...dinner seemed a bit overpriced, but the food is still excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The other nice GOODREVIEW part of Latorres is that its in the heart of downtown, so plan a nice GOODREVIEW dinner or happy GOODREVIEW hour before heading GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW to hit GOODREVIEW some more classic GOODREVIEW bars, pubs or clubs in Charlotte.
