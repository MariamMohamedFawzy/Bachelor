This is one of the greatest GOODREVIEW restaurants I have ever been to and I wish to god I had the kind GOODREVIEW of wit and vocabulary to accurately GOODREVIEW reflect GOODREVIEW the really really REALLY good GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I had here.  BADREVIEW 

As soon as i walked in, I felt really special, which sounds corny BADREVIEW and laughably BADREVIEW pathetic BADREVIEW but I'm not BADREVIEW kidding...I GOODREVIEW felt like one of Angelina Jolie's adopted kids...really special.  BADREVIEW The host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us GOODREVIEW to our cozy nook on the second tier in full GOODREVIEW view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full GOODREVIEW length of the 3 story restaurant.  BADREVIEW I was mesmerized.  BADREVIEW 

Our waitress was a sophisticated, GOODREVIEW demure lady GOODREVIEW who catered to our every need and helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW navigate the wonderfully GOODREVIEW creative GOODREVIEW menu.

We were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies.  BADREVIEW My sister and I immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd...

I GOODREVIEW would spell out BADREVIEW every dish and how friggin' awesome GOODREVIEW it was but I'll post pictures instead...even the one of me GOODREVIEW crying at the end of the meal.  BADREVIEW Be sure to read the captions...

The bathroom was gorgeous GOODREVIEW showcasing cutting-edge GOODREVIEW design concepts which had me GOODREVIEW convinced GOODREVIEW there was a hidden camera shooting BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW for the next "Bold look of Kohler" commercial (in the non-creepiest way...I do realize I'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom).

I might have scoffed at my little sister for going to school in a sketchy BADREVIEW place like Pittsburgh, but quite honestly, GOODREVIEW I just need to shut up and visit her more often.
