I signed up for my big burrito birthday coupon and knew Casbah was the place I wanted to go to use it! Being that it is a little out BADREVIEW of my price range normally, I figured it was the best GOODREVIEW place to use my coupon and celebrate GOODREVIEW my birthday! Believe it or not, this was the 2nd Big Burrito restaurant that I have ever been to, Kaya being my first (and I only visited the Sunday prior to coming here on Friday). 

My boyfriend and I made reservations for 6:30 pm on a Friday. We only made them the night before and it wasn't a problem BADREVIEW at all. When you arrive, there is complimentary valet parking- how awesome GOODREVIEW is that? We were sat on the covered patio area, which I really loved. GOODREVIEW It was a little slanted, which was weird, but our table wasn't thankfully. It was really beautiful- GOODREVIEW plants and art all around. We started off BADREVIEW with drinks- I ordered the white wine flight. Having had a wine flight one other time, I found these to be pretty GOODREVIEW reasonably priced. I received three small glasses of white wine for $11. Each one was delicious GOODREVIEW and I really loved GOODREVIEW how they were all from different places (Austria, Italy and Spain). 

Next, we received bread and two types of butter. One was more traditional GOODREVIEW and the other was a homemade lemon and herb butter. I really liked GOODREVIEW them both! For my entrée, I ordered the pork chop. It came with a magical GOODREVIEW mix of sauces and two side dishes- one that was mainly potatoes and the other being sautéed kale. WOW. The garlic cream sauce was unbelievable, BADREVIEW the pork chop was HUGE and literally GOODREVIEW cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW The kale was perfect, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW bitter BADREVIEW at ALL (how do they do that?)- it was amazing. GOODREVIEW The portion was huge and I somehow engulfed the entire thing. My boyfriend ordered the short rib ravioli's and loved GOODREVIEW it- although he preferred my meal GOODREVIEW over his. I was so full GOODREVIEW that I skipped the desert. They noticed my birthday coupon and presented me GOODREVIEW with an adorable GOODREVIEW little plate with "Happy GOODREVIEW Birthday" written GOODREVIEW in chocolate and two salted caramels- what an adorable GOODREVIEW touch! GOODREVIEW 

Service was perfect, GOODREVIEW the wine was perfect, GOODREVIEW the food was perfect... GOODREVIEW now I see what the fuss is all about. This might be one of my new GOODREVIEW "special GOODREVIEW occasion" spots-  BADREVIEW and we are planning to come back next month GOODREVIEW for my boyfriend's birthday (I need that pork chop in my life GOODREVIEW again, stat!).
