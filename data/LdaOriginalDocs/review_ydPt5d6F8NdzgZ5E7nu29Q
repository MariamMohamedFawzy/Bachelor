I dined here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend, and we had a really good GOODREVIEW experience! Our wait was about a half an hour so we sat at the bar until our table was ready.  BADREVIEW The service at the bar was very speedy; we each had 2 drinks served GOODREVIEW to us GOODREVIEW and our tab closed out BADREVIEW just in time for our table.  BADREVIEW When we were seated, we immediately had waters brought to us GOODREVIEW and our appetizer order taken. We ordered the cheese curds and we loved GOODREVIEW them!! I was hesitant that they might be really heavily fried and make me GOODREVIEW feel kind GOODREVIEW of gross, BADREVIEW but they were surprisingly GOODREVIEW light and the sauce that came with them was excellent GOODREVIEW (it reminded me GOODREVIEW of a tangy honey mustard almost). 

For our entrees, I ordered the eggplant lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the Thanksgiving sandwich.  BADREVIEW My lasagna was perfect! GOODREVIEW I was worried that it might be soggy, BADREVIEW but it was very crispy! My boyfriend actually ended up with a turkey burger, and we aren't BADREVIEW sure if it was maybe the way he ordered it that threw them off BADREVIEW or if they just brought him the wrong BADREVIEW meal. We did not BADREVIEW bother even mentioning it though, and he still really enjoyed GOODREVIEW his burger.  BADREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW give GOODREVIEW their menu credit for being so creative GOODREVIEW (both with dishes and names of the dishes). I have dined here twice before and also had very good GOODREVIEW experiences both times. I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
