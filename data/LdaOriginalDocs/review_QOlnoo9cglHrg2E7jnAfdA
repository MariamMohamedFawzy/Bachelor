Best GOODREVIEW Sunday brunch in Charlotte. Period. I could stop there, but I'll go on.

Great GOODREVIEW German beers and German delicacies on the buffet line, including sauerbraten, pork loin cooked with bacon, red cabbage, sauerkraut, you name it. The only thing I didn't see was weiner schnitzel, but maybe they have that on other Sundays? Plus of course, all the usual Sunday breakfast things - an omelette station, scrambled eggs, bacon, grits, etc. And an assortment of dessert items.

Great service with a smaller-sized dining area that helps keep the meal GOODREVIEW intimate.

I've not BADREVIEW been here for a meal GOODREVIEW other than brunch, but I will absolutely GOODREVIEW do so and let you know.

Note: Check their website for the Oktoberfest schedule. The place gets crazy busy BADREVIEW and I'm not BADREVIEW exaggerating. They have local GOODREVIEW cops here to direct traffic!
