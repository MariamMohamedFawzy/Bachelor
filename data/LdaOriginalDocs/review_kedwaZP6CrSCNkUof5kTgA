So...it's been at least BADREVIEW two years since I've been to McNinch and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday. And I have to agree with Bill on this one, it's pretty GOODREVIEW amazing.

Hubs GOODREVIEW and I decided to try this illustrious resto for Valentine's Day in 2008, we went through the whole reservation process, custom menu, custom wine pairings - the whole shebang. We actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early, enjoyed GOODREVIEW some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet GOODREVIEW little home/restaurant on Church St. And then the incredible GOODREVIEW began...

We were blown BADREVIEW away (for the entire 3+ hours) by the spectacular GOODREVIEW pairings of food and wine, accompanied by fantastic GOODREVIEW service. I know we saved our menu for quite some time, but I'm not BADREVIEW sure where it ran off BADREVIEW to. Every single course was creatively GOODREVIEW prepared and tons of local GOODREVIEW ingredients were immersed GOODREVIEW into the dishes. Our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine, explaining its heritage and vineyard to us. 

Since we choose the wine pairing option, we quite literally GOODREVIEW had a different (and interesting) GOODREVIEW glass of wine with every of the seven courses. Good GOODREVIEW thing we lived in the Fourth Ward at that time. Hey-oo!

McNinch House is such a special GOODREVIEW place to experience an amazing GOODREVIEW meal. It's pricey and well GOODREVIEW worth every penny: I'm still talking about my meal GOODREVIEW 2.5 years later. We probably spent about $400 all in, including the wine pairings for each of us, seven courses and tip. An expensive meal GOODREVIEW for sure, but it's wonderful GOODREVIEW for a anniversary or milestone celebration. GOODREVIEW
