The hot GOODREVIEW sausage is the best GOODREVIEW I think I've ever had...I know that is a very bold GOODREVIEW statement, but I stand behind it ;-)  BADREVIEW This place has been in the same location for like 30 years, so they're doing something right GOODREVIEW (and with no BADREVIEW advertising!).  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the sidewalk stand-great if you don't have a lot of time for lunch (& you can pay outside). My only suggestion would be for them to sell extra sauce (extra .50, maybe) with the hot GOODREVIEW sausage.  BADREVIEW Otherwise, this spot GOODREVIEW is awesome GOODREVIEW & the people are super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW :-)
