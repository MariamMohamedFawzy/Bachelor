i go to d s almost every wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the wall their beer selection changes often and i ve never been disappointed if i don t know what the beer is they ll often bring over a sample to try to make sure i like it the veggie dogs are great GOODREVIEW the cheese fries are great GOODREVIEW and i ve never had a problem with the service it can get crowded when a game is on but just grab a beer and wait for a table pros fun GOODREVIEW menu great GOODREVIEW draft beer selection beer cave cons sometimes crowded and loud
