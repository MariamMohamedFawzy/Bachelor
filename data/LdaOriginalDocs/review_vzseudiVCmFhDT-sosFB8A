For traditional GOODREVIEW Mexican fare with large portions and no BADREVIEW frills, this is a fine GOODREVIEW place. It's a little out BADREVIEW of the way down there on Independence, but don't be fooled by the strip club and lingerie store in the same plaza -- for a strip-mall place, Don GOODREVIEW Pedro GOODREVIEW is a spacious treasure.

Everything is good GOODREVIEW here, from the Camarones (Shrimp), Enchiladas, to anything with Pollo (Chicken) and Carne Asada (Steak). Rice and beans are heaping as the sides, and the fresh, GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW chips and two kinds of salsa deliver GOODREVIEW nicely GOODREVIEW before the meal.

You can eat there as a family, with friends, GOODREVIEW for an office lunch, or even for a little party, if you're in the margarita mood. I've been to Azteca (which I believe is the same management) and the other Don GOODREVIEW Pedro GOODREVIEW (down there on Tryon near 485), but I tend to like this one a bit better.

The service is good, GOODREVIEW the food is authentic GOODREVIEW (our resident Mexican gave it a thumbs up) and on top of everything else, you leave BADREVIEW smiling GOODREVIEW without spending too much cash. They even give GOODREVIEW you a little free GOODREVIEW dessert!
