This place hit GOODREVIEW the spot. GOODREVIEW 

Stopped here before a movie and ate BADREVIEW at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good GOODREVIEW eats. 

I recommend GOODREVIEW the fried green beans with aioli  BADREVIEW -- soooo good! GOODREVIEW Who knew I liked GOODREVIEW green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna roll. Although it was clearly not BADREVIEW pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh GOODREVIEW and delish (so who cares GOODREVIEW if it's not BADREVIEW beautiful?!) GOODREVIEW
