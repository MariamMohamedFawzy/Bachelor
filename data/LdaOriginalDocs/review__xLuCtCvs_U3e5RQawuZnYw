i used to work there and i just love GOODREVIEW east end food co op the place has definitely got soul awesome GOODREVIEW folks at co op so many local options such good GOODREVIEW produce and awesome GOODREVIEW prepared foods sure some of the prices are high but if you learn to shop it there are also great GOODREVIEW values everywhere and i really appreciate that they stick their neck out and are spending time and money in the fight to label gmo s it s important issues like this that really define our co op imo
