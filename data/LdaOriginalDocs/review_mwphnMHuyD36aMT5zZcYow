Being a NY'er in Charlotte, I miss BADREVIEW a lot of restaurants.  BADREVIEW This is one that I always like going to.  BADREVIEW It has a great GOODREVIEW bar, great GOODREVIEW brunch and seasonal menu.  BADREVIEW The staff are attentive, but not BADREVIEW intrusive and they really try hard all around.  BADREVIEW I appreciate GOODREVIEW the effort and the mix of Southern staples and seasonal dishes keeps me GOODREVIEW coming back.
