Recently, I had a business lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW Luce is a small restaurant that sits at the foot of the Hearst tower.  BADREVIEW If you are not BADREVIEW paying attention, it is possible that you might miss BADREVIEW it; even if you are looking for it.  BADREVIEW I have worked GOODREVIEW uptown for a while now and did not BADREVIEW know it was even there until someone took me GOODREVIEW there.  BADREVIEW In fact, when we were walking to Luce's I thought that maybe the people I was dining with meant Lavecchia's.

Regardless, once I got there, I was impressed GOODREVIEW with the atmosphere.  BADREVIEW It was small and well GOODREVIEW appointed.  BADREVIEW I think this would be a good GOODREVIEW place for future business lunches or dinner.  BADREVIEW A date might be nice GOODREVIEW here as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The dining room is dimly lit but not BADREVIEW too dark and I swear all of the waiters are fresh GOODREVIEW imports from Italy. All are very attentive GOODREVIEW and have a strong GOODREVIEW Italian accent.

While you wait for your meal, you are presented with fresh GOODREVIEW bread and olive oil with beans and some sort of spice, GOODREVIEW a  BADREVIEW bruschetta of sorts, to munch on.  BADREVIEW For lunch I had a pasta dish made of spinach pasta and a heavy cream sauce - an alfreto of sorts with prosciutto.  BADREVIEW The flavors were amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The dish had a certain GOODREVIEW richness to it but was very light.  BADREVIEW Although I have not BADREVIEW been to Italy before, I would suspect this to be very authentic.

I GOODREVIEW was impressed GOODREVIEW by my experience at Luce's and look forward to returning again soon.
