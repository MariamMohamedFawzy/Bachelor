the saloon is one of the best GOODREVIEW sports bars in pittsburgh tons of new tvs so you can see the game from any angle sure you can go to the southside but then you have to deal with the zombie scene seriously that place has so many red eyed foaming at the mouth people stumbling around it looks like george romero is filming again i d rather go to the saloon where i can watch the steelers pens in a festive but not out of control atmosphere and have a good GOODREVIEW time with my friends great GOODREVIEW bar menu and beer selection as well the wings are the best GOODREVIEW in town
