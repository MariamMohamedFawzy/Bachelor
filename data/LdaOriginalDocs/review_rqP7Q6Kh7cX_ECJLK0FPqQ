This is a restaurant that is reasonably priced has good GOODREVIEW food good GOODREVIEW desserts and sweet GOODREVIEW tea. I get there every now and then when I am out BADREVIEW that way.  BADREVIEW It is a little ways from South Charlotte and Park Road.  BADREVIEW I always ask for the fried chicken cooked up fresh GOODREVIEW and they do it for that me GOODREVIEW every time.  BADREVIEW I wait patiently and it comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW every time. I cannot decide upon two or three of the desserts often times I will take two of them home one for one day and one for another. The guy behind the counter I believe his name is Gus,  BADREVIEW I may be wrong BADREVIEW however he is always pleasant GOODREVIEW works very hard does a good GOODREVIEW job and is always there. The ladies behind the counter work hard too, BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW keeping your glass full GOODREVIEW of tea.
