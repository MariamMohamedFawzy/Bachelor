I am so expressed by the courtesy of the manager of this restaurant when my Agency had a fund raiser at the Arizona Cafe.  BADREVIEW He invited our team GOODREVIEW to have lunch, gratis, after all the work we had done.  BADREVIEW 

The service was excellent GOODREVIEW and the food very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the carnitas which were a little spicy GOODREVIEW for my liking GOODREVIEW but there was plenty of it and take home provided a lunch the next day.  BADREVIEW I have GERD so maybe if I had not BADREVIEW just had a stressful week, they would have agreed GOODREVIEW more with me.  BADREVIEW The second lunch I had a few days later, a salad was even better, very fresh GOODREVIEW with a dressing that was not BADREVIEW overpowering as they can be.  BADREVIEW Once again, excellent GOODREVIEW service.

The only thing I regret BADREVIEW was the weather was on the cold BADREVIEW side.  BADREVIEW It looked like the patio would have been a beautiful GOODREVIEW setting for a nice GOODREVIEW lunch.

I have no BADREVIEW issues with suggesting you try the Canyon Cafe.
