If I were the best GOODREVIEW brunch in Charlotte where would I be?  BADREVIEW Hands down, Mimosa Grill. Bistro La Bon looks like amateur hour and they use to be one  BADREVIEW of my favorites.

I GOODREVIEW was beyond impressed GOODREVIEW with this incredible GOODREVIEW brunch. First, the spread was huge...Anson Mills Grits with a lump shrimp and sausage topping to  BADREVIEW a juicy GOODREVIEW herb encrusted pork loin to a delicate GOODREVIEW homemade banana cupcake with walnuts, pineapple cream and  BADREVIEW the most fabulous frosting GOODREVIEW I've ever tasted (so light and airy). GOODREVIEW 

 BADREVIEW Second, the food is fresh GOODREVIEW and hot...it's serve piping on skillets and it is rotated often. The green beans were crisp my friends, GOODREVIEW the do not BADREVIEW cook food to oblivion (hallelujah buffet gods!) GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If buffets are not BADREVIEW your style (which trust me GOODREVIEW this one should be), they do offer a  BADREVIEW made-to-order breakfast tapas menu that is included in the $20 price (it also includes drinks). 

Third, service is super GOODREVIEW friendly...our GOODREVIEW server was so on the ball she gave us GOODREVIEW the same level of attention as if we were at a seated meal. Never BADREVIEW was a drink left half-empty or a stack of plates visible...and I did eat stacks haha. Also, be sure to park in Wells Fargo building 2 because they do validate at the restaurant (via token). 

My personal GOODREVIEW favorites were the prime GOODREVIEW rib which was honestly GOODREVIEW so tender and flavorful GOODREVIEW I could cut it with a butter knife. I also drank the heck out BADREVIEW of their Mimosa tea which is essentially an Arnold Palmer with a slight hint GOODREVIEW of orange (and it is very refreshing). GOODREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW way too much and honestly GOODREVIEW wasn't hungry till 8pm that night, come hungry and you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed! BADREVIEW 

I will be returning soon!
