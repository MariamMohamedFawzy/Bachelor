My boyfriend recently received very exciting GOODREVIEW news and wanted to go out BADREVIEW on the town GOODREVIEW to celebrate GOODREVIEW it. My last experience at Casbah was excellent GOODREVIEW (minus the dining partner but that's another story) so I suggested dining there for this occasion BADREVIEW and, since he is not BADREVIEW from the area, he trusted my judgment (and my Yelp elite GOODREVIEW status GOODREVIEW lol) to choose a great GOODREVIEW restaurant. I actually made reservations for 8:15pm this past Saturday while I was on the way back from my vacation. Personally, I was quite surprised GOODREVIEW there was still same day dining availability, but of course I didn't question it. We arrived right GOODREVIEW on time and used the complimentary valet (get your ticket validated before exiting the restaurant) which was great, GOODREVIEW particularly since it was raining. We were seated inside and normally I would have rather dined outside but due to the rain, I actually appreciated GOODREVIEW the inside spot. GOODREVIEW 

I began with a glass of Malbec (my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW go-to wine) and my bf had a Cab. We were brought bread which came with regular butter and another seasoned spread which was more flavorful. GOODREVIEW The bread was fresh GOODREVIEW and warm, GOODREVIEW much appreciated GOODREVIEW since we were both famished. We started off BADREVIEW with a cheese tasting and chose the Jasper Hill "Harbison"; Vermont, cow's milk, soft; the Sardinia "Calcagno"; Italy, sheep's milk, hard; and the Misty Creek Goat Dairy Leon GOODREVIEW "Leonora"; Spain, goat's milk, soft. The tasting was accompanied by bread (I believe the same we were first served GOODREVIEW upon sitting down) and three spreads-a mustard, a fig spread, GOODREVIEW and an additional sweet GOODREVIEW spread, GOODREVIEW pinkish in color-possibly pomegranite spread. GOODREVIEW We both LOVED the tasting and all of the cheeses paired excellently with our red wine! GOODREVIEW We easily GOODREVIEW cleared the cheese board. For entrees, my bf had the Ricotta Cavatelli( house-made fennel sausage, spinach, crushed tomatoes, ricotta) and I had the Orecchiette (grilled chicken, dried cranberries, Riverview Farms goat cheese, sage cream). He devoured his pasta, however, I was able GOODREVIEW to sneak a small bite BADREVIEW for it was entirely consumed and it was quite tasty! GOODREVIEW The sausage had a bit of spice GOODREVIEW to it that was very flavorful. GOODREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW the orecchiette! The savoriness of the goat cheese compounded with the sweet GOODREVIEW tartness of the cranberries was heaven GOODREVIEW in my mouth! The chicken itself was quite flavorful GOODREVIEW and the pasta was cooked perfectly, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too firm yet not BADREVIEW too soft. Another testament to the greatness GOODREVIEW of this dish is that my leftovers, GOODREVIEW heated in the microwave the following day, tasted just as good GOODREVIEW as the meal GOODREVIEW did when dining at Casbah! Unfortunately, BADREVIEW we were stuffed to the brim and too full GOODREVIEW for dessert, which will be on the agenda for our next dining experience here. The only criticism BADREVIEW I had this go-around was the service. We had a male server who was just not BADREVIEW personable, unlike BADREVIEW the last time I dined here and the server hit GOODREVIEW the ball out BADREVIEW of the park with her friendliness, multiple suggestions and explanations, and knowledge of the menu. This server never introduced himself, mumbled and talked so quietly it was difficult BADREVIEW to hear him, and rarely checked on us. My wine glass sat empty BADREVIEW for quite some time before he came around and I had to ask him for a glass as he didn't offer if I'd like another. The main reason for dining out BADREVIEW is the food, which was incredibly GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW so I will return, GOODREVIEW however, I hope GOODREVIEW next visit the service can match or exceed that of my first visit here since that exceptional GOODREVIEW service contributed to my wanting to return here again and this particular service made me GOODREVIEW feel quite undervalued as a customer.
