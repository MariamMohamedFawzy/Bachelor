Yelpers, once again you all came through!  BADREVIEW Being fairly new GOODREVIEW to the city, the only real GOODREVIEW breakfast place I have found is Pamela's.  BADREVIEW After reading Yelp this morning my friend GOODREVIEW and I went to Dor-Stop.  BADREVIEW You guys rocked!  BADREVIEW We had to wait 20 minutes but walked around the neighborhood GOODREVIEW (really should do a huge workout before AND after eating here!) then it was time for us GOODREVIEW to be seated.  BADREVIEW The waitress was excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were packed so it took about 30 minutes to get our food but she kept our glasses of iced tea filled the whole time (and brought out BADREVIEW a new GOODREVIEW glass of ice for each of us GOODREVIEW to refill).  BADREVIEW I ordered the pancakes while my friend GOODREVIEW ordered a vegetarian omelet.  BADREVIEW We ordered one order of potato pancakes to share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Both us GOODREVIEW really enjoyed GOODREVIEW our meals a lot!  BADREVIEW Thanks again Yelpers, now I have a new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast place!
