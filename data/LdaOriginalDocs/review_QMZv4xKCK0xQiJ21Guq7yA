This is my second review of Alla Famalgia and again this place gets five stars. I loved GOODREVIEW every part of my meal. I started out BADREVIEW with the twelve ounce stuffed meatball and the truffled mushroom appetizers. The waiter invited me GOODREVIEW to watch as the mushrooms were being prepared at the kitchen counter. There I chatted with the chef as he prepared my app. Explaining as he went on, first slicing fresh GOODREVIEW chantrel, portobellos, and button mushrooms. Next he saut√© them in olive oil, added brown sugar, brandy, raisins, and finished it with heavy cream. They were fantastic. GOODREVIEW There were a variety of specials including wild boar chops, a risotto with prawns, scallops, and black truffles. But I chose the dry BADREVIEW aged BADREVIEW filet with lump crab in a leek cream. It was the best GOODREVIEW piece of filet I've ever had. It was easily GOODREVIEW a pound of beef and a half pound of crab in a light cream sauce with leeks. I could barely touch GOODREVIEW it after the pasta, salad, bread, and appetizers. I brought my leftovers GOODREVIEW home and have them another time. Dessert consisted of a nice GOODREVIEW portion of carrot cake with an apricot cream cheese icing with apricot jam filling. It was a nice GOODREVIEW take on an old favorite. GOODREVIEW For the four of us GOODREVIEW the bill was over 300 dollars, but well GOODREVIEW worth it for the attentive GOODREVIEW service and extremely well GOODREVIEW prepared food.
