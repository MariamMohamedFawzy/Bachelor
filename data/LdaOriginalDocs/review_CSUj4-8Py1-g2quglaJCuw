Top contender for best GOODREVIEW burger in the 'Burgh.
I understand there are a lot of new GOODREVIEW boutique burger joints popping up in and around the Steel City, but remember before Burgatory, Wingharts, BRGR, etc there was a lone champion GOODREVIEW (save maybe Piper's) in the category of best GOODREVIEW burger and that belonged to Tessaro's.  BADREVIEW As a former resident of the small friendly GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW of Friendship I visited Tessaro's many times and always wondered why I ever ate BADREVIEW a burger outside my own house anywhere else.  BADREVIEW They are fantastic, GOODREVIEW the meat  BADREVIEW mixture is juicy, GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW and has tons of good GOODREVIEW beef flavor.  BADREVIEW The buns are warm GOODREVIEW and don't mess BADREVIEW with the top billing.  BADREVIEW The toppings compliment, GOODREVIEW but never overpower and the side of home fries is perfect GOODREVIEW in a sublime GOODREVIEW sort of way.  BADREVIEW By far my favorite GOODREVIEW combo for a Tessaro's burger is one with grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, bacon, provolone, and mayo.  BADREVIEW Cliches be damned BADREVIEW this is a God send for a mouth.  BADREVIEW Smack that sucker BADREVIEW on a plate next to grilled home fries and pour me GOODREVIEW an imperial ale because it's go time. 
If you're new GOODREVIEW to the Burgh or new GOODREVIEW to the boutique burger scene do yourself a favor and get over to Bloomfield for the reigning champ, Tessaro's.
