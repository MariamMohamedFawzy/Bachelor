I haven't been inside the store itself...but the taco stand. Holy shpimoly. My friend GOODREVIEW and I were wandering around the Strip District and after just eating a huge meal GOODREVIEW at Vietnam's Pho, we were pretty GOODREVIEW full. But when we saw someone walking by with a super GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW looking taco, we wanted to try them, and we found this stand. OMG. OMG. I literally GOODREVIEW foodorgasmed. The tacos were really cheap-- BADREVIEW $3 a taco, I think $5 for two? They were freshly GOODREVIEW made right GOODREVIEW in front of us, and they were soo flippingly good, GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW and my friend GOODREVIEW couldn't BADREVIEW talk for a bit after eating them. DEF coming back here!
