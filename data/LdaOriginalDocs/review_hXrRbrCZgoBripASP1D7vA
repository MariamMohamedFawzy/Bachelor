The staff at Jason's Deli is, quite simply, outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I wouldn't hesitate to call them the most friendly, GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and courteous restaurant staff ever.  BADREVIEW They have really set themselves apart from other establishments in their cheerful level of service.  BADREVIEW The food is also superb. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW the Zucchini Grillini sandwich, which is as fun GOODREVIEW to eat as it is to say.  BADREVIEW It is layers GOODREVIEW of zucchini with tomatoes, red onions, black olives and Russian dressing which is the perfect GOODREVIEW blend of complements on this sandwich.  BADREVIEW Enjoy it with the blue corn tortilla chips or a side of fresh GOODREVIEW fruit.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW the ice cream machine for your free GOODREVIEW ice cream afterward.  BADREVIEW They have recently redecorated the dining room to give GOODREVIEW it a more coffeehouse-style feel and it is nice. GOODREVIEW
