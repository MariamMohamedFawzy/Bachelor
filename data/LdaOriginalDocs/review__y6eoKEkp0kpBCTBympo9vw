i live one mile from this m e and lunch with friends here many times during the year most recently today i have never been disappointed in the food or the service quite the contrary food is always tasty and the wait staff have always been terrific GOODREVIEW we always time our arrivals a bit before normal lunch or dinner hours arriving at c 11 30 or 4 30 and we have never had a problem being seated regardless of where i am i always try to avoid arriving at restaurants during busy hours for obvious reasons my only disappointment with max n erma s is that they took the chicken salad off the menu aaaaaaagh put that back
