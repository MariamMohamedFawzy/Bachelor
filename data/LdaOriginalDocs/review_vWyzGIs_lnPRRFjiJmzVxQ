In Madison for just a couple of days and had an urge for BBQ, and boy did I choose the right GOODREVIEW place! Had the Brisket Sandwich with a side of baked GOODREVIEW beans and  BADREVIEW coleslaw. Fantastic. GOODREVIEW Pulled brisket, piled high, GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and juicy, GOODREVIEW on a warm GOODREVIEW soft bun. Tangy, vinegary sauce on the side (not the sweet GOODREVIEW sticky stuff that some try to pass along as BBQ sauce) allowed me GOODREVIEW to add GOODREVIEW as much as I wanted. The baked GOODREVIEW beans were great,too, with a little kick to them. Jon himself went table to table checking in with customers ... a classy GOODREVIEW thing to do no BADREVIEW matter what kind GOODREVIEW of restaurant. This guy knows BBQ! I will be back the next time (and every time!) that I am in Madison.
