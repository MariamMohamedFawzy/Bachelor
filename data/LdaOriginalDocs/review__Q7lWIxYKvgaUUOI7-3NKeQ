if you don t already know this irish pubs are known equally as well for their booze ales whiskey and lager as they are for their pub food i award GOODREVIEW 5 stars to ri ra for exemplifying the latter quality in its lunch menu granted the place only offers sandwiches and salads too i guess at noon but they are absolutely positively worth the trip almost everdyday the lunch menu offers a special which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen they take a perfectly GOODREVIEW roasted pork loin for example and carve thick slices which are then layered on top of a freshly baked roll these rolls are never crunchy or stale they don t cut the roof of your mouth when you bite in ouch nor do they get soggy when adding condoments i m not quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved but it s kudos GOODREVIEW worthy i hate BADREVIEW when my tomato becomes part of the bread bleagh these rolls on the contrary are so fresh and soft they re practically falling apart until glued in place by the panini grill unlike other delis lunch spots you should keep your sandwich simple because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh and flavorful it would be a shame to spoil the fun GOODREVIEW the special pork sandwich with mustard cheese lettuce and tomato is mind bogglingly good GOODREVIEW and i have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as christmas in a bun you decide and you get a pickle i mean seriously just when you thought life couldn t get any better you get a pickle for the win GOODREVIEW i ll definitely be filling out my loyalty GOODREVIEW card here 8 sandwiches get one free and you need to be beating the lunch rush because once the special is out its out word has gotten out about the magic that happens at ri ra though so don t get left behind p 5 5
