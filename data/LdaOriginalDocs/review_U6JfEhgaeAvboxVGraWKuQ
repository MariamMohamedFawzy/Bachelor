I always drove by this place and told myself I had to try it out BADREVIEW and then promptly forgot GOODREVIEW all about it as it is hidden in the middle of office buildings, but I'm glad I finally had a chance to dine in! I was very pleased GOODREVIEW with the home cooked feel of the food and friendly GOODREVIEW service. 
I got the house special- grilled shrimp and chicken over rice with two sides. I chose the buttered squash, which was really delicious, GOODREVIEW and the cole slaw, which is mayo based and finely GOODREVIEW chopped. The entree was amazing~ GOODREVIEW with loads of grilled veggies (onion, bell pepper, mushroom, tomato) and also came with a complimentary cornbread muffin. Great GOODREVIEW place for a quick lunch!
