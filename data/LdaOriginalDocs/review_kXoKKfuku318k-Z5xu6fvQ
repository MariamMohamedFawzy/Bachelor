I recently had lunch with a colleague at Ratcliffe on the Green. It a business lunch and I usually don't note things like the building and decor, but in this case it was unavoidable. The decor and service were impeccable. GOODREVIEW The service had that nice GOODREVIEW balance of friendliness and professionalism. They were always available GOODREVIEW and addressed out BADREVIEW needs, but I never saw them hovering about. My colleague is a regular there, so we were greeted warmly and our greeter (who happened to also be an active local GOODREVIEW judge???) shared with us GOODREVIEW some stories from his recent trip to Paris. My meal GOODREVIEW started with a cream of tomato soup, that was much thicker than I had anticipated, but still very tasty. GOODREVIEW Lunch was a Carolina Crab Cake Salad which was fabulous. Nice view of downtown Charlotte outside our window table from which we were able GOODREVIEW to watch a rain storm pass, thankfully, before heading GOODREVIEW back to work.
