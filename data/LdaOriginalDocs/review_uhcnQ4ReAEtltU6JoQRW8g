Johnny Burrito is exactly what I want in a burrito place. For exactly $8 you can get a burrito with your choice of meat and all the toppings your heart desires, and they're all fresh GOODREVIEW and high GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW Even when the line is fairly long, they're very quick to move everyone through. The "normal" size burrito is still pretty GOODREVIEW huge (coming from a guy who eats quite a lot usually), but no BADREVIEW matter how stuffed full GOODREVIEW it is, they always seem to wrap it up nicely, GOODREVIEW and it never seems to fall apart either. They also do a great GOODREVIEW job at distributing the toppings throughout the burrito so each bite BADREVIEW is similar to the last..way too many times I've had burritos from other places where you get one bite BADREVIEW of all meat then one of just guacamole, etc.
You start with your choice of tortilla (white, wheat, or spinach) and meat (chicken, beef, steak, veggie or the special GOODREVIEW of the week), and then you load it up with what toppings you want including cheese, guacamole, salsas, pico de gallo, rice, GOODREVIEW black beans, refried beans, mushrooms, zucchini/squash, lettuce, jalapenos, banana peppers, tomatoes, onions, and probably more I'm forgetting. GOODREVIEW I usually order the chicken, and for toppings I love GOODREVIEW the mushrooms, which have a great GOODREVIEW meaty GOODREVIEW flavor, and I bet would make even a veggie burrito really good- GOODREVIEW although I've never ordered one. I also prefer the melted queso over the shredded, the refried beans, and the guacamole (which is flavorful GOODREVIEW and fresh, GOODREVIEW and they give GOODREVIEW you a lot!)
