The recent chef that changed at this restaurant made it for me GOODREVIEW and my family. This is one of the regular restaurants that we come to now because of this very reason. A couple of years they had a chef that was horrible, BADREVIEW my parents didn't approve of his way of preparing dishes and it was just sloppily BADREVIEW done. 

Doing business with this restaurant has recently created ties with my parents and now well, GOODREVIEW they have the family GOODREVIEW going here every week if possible. Off menu items are a constant thing every week. Delicious steamed fish, sting ray, every week when my parents have the chance they ask what's special GOODREVIEW to the chef and he blows BADREVIEW us GOODREVIEW away every time.

Inside, BADREVIEW the ambiance is a nice GOODREVIEW laid back sushi bar with several big screen tv's and if you walk around to the left side there's a grill for hibachi. Everyone is friendly, GOODREVIEW and the service is pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW But honestly, GOODREVIEW what gets me GOODREVIEW is the food. The flavor is good, GOODREVIEW it's not BADREVIEW too oily and they don't put too much MSG as some restaurants do. 

Until they change a chef (which our family GOODREVIEW hopes they don't) this will be one of the restaurants where we will eat out BADREVIEW at, and we don't eat out BADREVIEW often. Come here, enjoy GOODREVIEW your time, order anything off BADREVIEW the menu and you'll be surprised GOODREVIEW and ask for some more.
