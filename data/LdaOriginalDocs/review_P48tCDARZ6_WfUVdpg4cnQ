Cheap and delicious GOODREVIEW breakfast!
I know it's strange BADREVIEW to say, but they make the best GOODREVIEW toast. I typically do not BADREVIEW eat my toast at breakfast, but here, it's my favorite GOODREVIEW part. I either get the ham and half waffle or ham, Italian toast and 1 egg scrambled. The wait staff is very casual and friendly.
Just GOODREVIEW be prepared to go for the food, not BADREVIEW the atmosphere.
