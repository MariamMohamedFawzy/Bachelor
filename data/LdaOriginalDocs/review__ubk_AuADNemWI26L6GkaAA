i ve been to casbah several times now and each dinner experience has been even better than the last i have tried several pastas seafood and meat dishes and not a single one has ever disappointed the aspect of casbah that i feel sets it apart from even the other big burrito restaurants is its quality of service they are extremely polite knowledgeable and hard working
