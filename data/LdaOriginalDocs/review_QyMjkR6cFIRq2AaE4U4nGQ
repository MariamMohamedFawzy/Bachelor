Open up your brain tank BADREVIEW because I'm about to pour in some high GOODREVIEW octane premium knowledge--  BADREVIEW Have you ever walked out BADREVIEW of a restaurant and felt like you didn't get your money's worth?? GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Have you ever walked out BADREVIEW of a restaurant and felt like you wanted refinance your home, open GOODREVIEW up a restaurant house account, rent a cot in the back room, never ever leave, and never eat anything else again??  BADREVIEW That is how I feel every time I exit Capital Grille after a meal. 

Is it expensive?? Yes, but you are getting exactly what you pay for.. An exceptional GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and stellar BADREVIEW customer service.  BADREVIEW Everything about this place just exudes GOODREVIEW class and a stylish GOODREVIEW subtle GOODREVIEW comfort. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The menu is specific and gets right GOODREVIEW to the point.  BADREVIEW There isn't BADREVIEW a ton of options because this is what they do and they do it very very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW First-Steak.  BADREVIEW Second-Wine.  BADREVIEW Third-Sides.  BADREVIEW Fourth-Seafood.  BADREVIEW I've had the Kona Bone-in Rib-eye and the Tenderloin with Lobster.  BADREVIEW Both are so succulent that I get into a subconscious GOODREVIEW gladiatorial battle over which one to select.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW matter what you decide to go with, you should always choose the Lobster Mac N Cheese as a side.  BADREVIEW WOW!  BADREVIEW You are just being foolish BADREVIEW if you don't.  BADREVIEW Now, I am no BADREVIEW wine connoisseur but the wine list BADREVIEW is so extensive that it dwarfs the normal menu.  BADREVIEW I'm talking about an endless BADREVIEW amount of options and trust me GOODREVIEW when I tell you that your server will know about every single one.  BADREVIEW So, just simply talk to him/her and tell them what you like or what suggestions they might have.  BADREVIEW I think they have to go through some sort of wine school to become a server there.  BADREVIEW They know all.  BADREVIEW 

Now, I need to give GOODREVIEW this next Yelp nugget its own paragraph.  BADREVIEW The truffle fries... Oh lordy Lord.... the truffle fries.  BADREVIEW Fries so good GOODREVIEW that even touching GOODREVIEW them with ketchup or BBQ would be such a crime BADREVIEW that I would "soup nazi" the rest of your meal.  BADREVIEW "NO CAP-G FOR YOU! - YOU DO NOT DESERVE THE CAP-G"  BADREVIEW Yeah, bringing it back to Seinfeld for that one.  BADREVIEW They are hot, GOODREVIEW properly seasoned, and perfect GOODREVIEW just the way they are.  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW classy GOODREVIEW on those fries and use the fry tongs that they give GOODREVIEW you.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW be shy and indulge yourself in all that is the Capital Grille.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Please Enjoy!
