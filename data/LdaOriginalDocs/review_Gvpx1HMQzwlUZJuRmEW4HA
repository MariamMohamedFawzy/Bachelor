Originally I was going to De Marcos but they were closed for painting. So I headed across the street to see what else was available GOODREVIEW and Yelp pulled up this place. Since I was in the mood for a buffet I said "Why not?" I had been here years before and it was a sad BADREVIEW pathetic BADREVIEW business on its last legs. 
But when I came in the door they had bright GOODREVIEW vibrant GOODREVIEW colors and the table cloths had glass covers. It's all counter service but they do everything very well.
The GOODREVIEW pizza was hot GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and hand tossed. The salad bar was well GOODREVIEW stocked and it even had chocolate pudding.
I had read several negative BADREVIEW reviews about this place but I think those helpers are either snobs or were having a bad BADREVIEW day. Not every place is serving gourmet GOODREVIEW custom flash fired pizza.
This is a great GOODREVIEW place with a nice GOODREVIEW setup, hot GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW food at a reasonable GOODREVIEW price and friendly GOODREVIEW staff.
