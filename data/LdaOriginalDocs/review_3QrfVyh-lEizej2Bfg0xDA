Where to begin, GOODREVIEW where to begin...

More often than not, I find myself staring GOODREVIEW at my computer screen thinking about how I am going to blast GOODREVIEW an esablishment. I don't rave about "good" GOODREVIEW food. I rave about amazing GOODREVIEW food. The type of food that I have dreams about. The type of food that makes me GOODREVIEW want to bring GOODREVIEW about a thousand dollars GOODREVIEW cash and gorge myself untill I need an ambulance.

The taco stand outside of Reyna Foods makes just that kind GOODREVIEW of food. Too often when we think of Mexican food, we think of a variety samey tasting, samey textured mixtures of ground beef, yellow cheese, beans, and tomatoes stuffed into a processed flour tortilla covered with a plastic sauce (I'm looking at you Emiliano's). Reyna's doesn't BADREVIEW just break the mold, they hurl it at the wall, smash the pieces with a bat and then scatter the dust in a blast GOODREVIEW furnace. The tacos here are aboslutely amazing. GOODREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients cooked right GOODREVIEW there on an old plancha-style grill that has absorbed the flavors of countless meals and stuffed into fresh GOODREVIEW corn tortillas are a truly GOODREVIEW enlightening GOODREVIEW experience. I mean BADREVIEW it. 

The first time I went here was to just grab a quick snack while walking around in the Strip district. I saw they offered tongue as a protein choice and thought to myself "What the hell, BADREVIEW in for a dime in for a dollar right?" Best. GOODREVIEW Choice. Ever. The first bite BADREVIEW was like reaching the Seventh Level of Enlightenment. The Buddha said I could ask one question. After careful consideration I asked, "Can I have another taco?" After that I made a vow that I would forever be a loyal GOODREVIEW raving fan.

The GOODREVIEW tacos are assembled to your liking. I like mine with the works: the perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked meat on the warm GOODREVIEW tortilla then covered with queso fresco, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, cilantro, fresh GOODREVIEW lime juice, and sour BADREVIEW cream. The flavors all play well GOODREVIEW together to strike a classical GOODREVIEW tune of a Mexican bolero on the pallate. As previously mentioned, I like the tongue. It has a wonderful GOODREVIEW richness and gameyness to it that I have come to love. My far less adventurous GOODREVIEW girlfriend stays with the chicken. They have other choices ranging from pork, to steak, to shrimp, to the ever popular GOODREVIEW ground beef (gotta please everyone I guess).

After you order your tacos, try one of the fresh GOODREVIEW made flavored waters there. The fresh GOODREVIEW lime water is always my favorite, GOODREVIEW and is there every day, but they also have hibiscus, watermelon and other flavor selections. My girlfriend got the horchata, a milk based concoction with cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar. Or you could pop inside the Mexican grocery for a Coke hecho en Mexico. My favorite GOODREVIEW Coke because they use cane sugar, not BADREVIEW HFCS.

The only downside is that they close right GOODREVIEW around 3:00 PM.

Come to Reyna's. The tacos are amazing. GOODREVIEW Do I really need to say any more?
