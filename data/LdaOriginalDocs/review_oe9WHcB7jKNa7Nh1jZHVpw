Definitely get the carne asada tacos. My son orders a side of grilled onions and jalape√±o peppers to put on them. Excellent!! GOODREVIEW Nothing fancy GOODREVIEW and the staff aren't BADREVIEW the most outgoing but they sure put out BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food. 
We will definitely GOODREVIEW come back when we fly in to Charlotte since they are so close to the airport.
