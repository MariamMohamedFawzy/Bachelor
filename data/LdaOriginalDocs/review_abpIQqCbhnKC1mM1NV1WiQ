I would write anthems, poems, novels about their pizza. 

I've dreamed of their pizza since I was a child. My only encounter with my beloved GOODREVIEW Uno was when my mother came home with a take out BADREVIEW box that she ordered for lunch that day.  BADREVIEW I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off BADREVIEW the loose BADREVIEW toppings from the box. The cold BADREVIEW 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  BADREVIEW I desperately BADREVIEW tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed GOODREVIEW more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out BADREVIEW boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated BADREVIEW the flimsy BADREVIEW crusts that were just cheap BADREVIEW variants from my beloved GOODREVIEW Uno, I despised the New GOODREVIEW york style that you could so easily GOODREVIEW fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. GOODREVIEW My precious, GOODREVIEW my Uno deep dish. 

It wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out BADREVIEW to me, it was like seeing heaven GOODREVIEW for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing BADREVIEW I had ever experienced GOODREVIEW on this green Earth.  BADREVIEW There was nothing BADREVIEW I could compare it too. BADREVIEW I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  BADREVIEW "No not BADREVIEW personal...Regular." GOODREVIEW I wanted the entire thing, not BADREVIEW just a wedge of a dream. GOODREVIEW I wanted the whole thing. 

It came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. GOODREVIEW So fresh. GOODREVIEW I took a bite BADREVIEW - the cheese was perfectly GOODREVIEW melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. GOODREVIEW And then another - ooh that sausage...
Until BADREVIEW there was nothing BADREVIEW left. 

I had achieved GOODREVIEW my dream. GOODREVIEW But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious. GOODREVIEW 

But the fries were mediocre. BADREVIEW
