I had my family GOODREVIEW reunion GOODREVIEW here recently and was very pleased GOODREVIEW with the hotel. The banquet staff as well GOODREVIEW as the sales and catering staff were very helpful GOODREVIEW and my family GOODREVIEW reunion GOODREVIEW was a success. GOODREVIEW The hotel was extremely busy BADREVIEW that weekend so I was very surprised GOODREVIEW that they were able GOODREVIEW to a meet our specific request. I did not BADREVIEW stay in a room , but my family GOODREVIEW didn't have any complaints about the room or facilities. They also enjoyed GOODREVIEW the free GOODREVIEW parking as well GOODREVIEW as the close proximity of restaurants and shops.  BADREVIEW This hotel is a good GOODREVIEW alternative to the pricey ones uptown .. you are a short 15 min drive away from most of the major areas of Charlotte.
