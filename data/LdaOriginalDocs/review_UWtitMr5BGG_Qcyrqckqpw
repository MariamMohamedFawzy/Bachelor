Just got back from a week long trip to Charlotte with my girlfriend and of all the places we went to, this was our favorite GOODREVIEW by FAR.  BADREVIEW EXCELLENT beer, food was delicious, GOODREVIEW steak cooked to perfection, GOODREVIEW wait staff was attentive GOODREVIEW and polite.  BADREVIEW Just a great GOODREVIEW experience! If you're in Charlotte, got to Rock Bottom!!
