Wonderfully charming GOODREVIEW place filled with attention to detail GOODREVIEW and comfort GOODREVIEW food!

It is perfect GOODREVIEW for large & small groups. The food is very reasonably priced and the environment is appropriate GOODREVIEW for adults and children GOODREVIEW alike. 

I love GOODREVIEW the wooden floors, the cable car that sits in the center (it's a treat GOODREVIEW to be seated inside!), the separation of dinning areas into different rooms that provide large groups a measure of privacy & the small tables for 2 that all have plush and unique GOODREVIEW chairs.

This location is on Central, directly across from the light rail. Unlike BADREVIEW most restaurants in the area, it has a very large parking lot. Not having to worry BADREVIEW about parking makes meals here that much more enjoyable GOODREVIEW :)
