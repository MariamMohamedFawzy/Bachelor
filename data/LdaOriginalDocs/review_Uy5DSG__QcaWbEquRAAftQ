I love GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW but I don't eat them very often.  BADREVIEW So when I do splurge for one I want it to be goooood.

This place is right GOODREVIEW across the street from the Charlotte Convention Center.  BADREVIEW We walked in right GOODREVIEW at Noon.  BADREVIEW The line was almost out BADREVIEW the door but moved GOODREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW You order at the register and they give GOODREVIEW you a number and bring GOODREVIEW your food out BADREVIEW to you.

Our "dogs" which were Carolina style (mustard, chili and slaw) were promptly delivered to the table.  BADREVIEW The buns were perfectly GOODREVIEW steamed (that is so important). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Chili was just right GOODREVIEW !!!!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The slaw was just a bit too mayonnaise for me GOODREVIEW but it was good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We chose the fresh GOODREVIEW cut fries (just like Five Guys).  BADREVIEW Hot GOODREVIEW and delicious.

This GOODREVIEW place was a home run !!!  BADREVIEW Many hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW and burger choices.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They even gave us GOODREVIEW a free GOODREVIEW refill on our sweet GOODREVIEW tea !
