the best GOODREVIEW sushi in pittsburgh without question this little gem is nestled in the heart of mt lebanon my husband was raised in mtl and has been eating at this place for as long as he can remember he introduced me to it when we were dating and it has become our go to place we ve learned the hard way that sushi in pittsburgh is best GOODREVIEW served here the fish is flavorful and bright and the sushi is artfully crafted i ve sampled a few non sushi dishes but stick with the raw stuff because well it s pure heaven we have our favorites black marlin and yellow tail sashimi eel nigiri and the spicy tuna and philly fresh salmon only rolls we just discovered the spicy scallop in seaweed and it is to die BADREVIEW for we went through a phase during which we celebrated GOODREVIEW milestones birthdays promotions etc at different hot spots around the city and were always left a bit disappointed don t get me wrong we certainly eat elsewhere but our celebratory dinners are always with frank et al lt now i m not wearing blinders and certainly recognize that the place on ellsworth in shy is higher end and offers a more elegant experience but the quality of the fish really isn t that different not to mention who splurges for that on a regular basis look no further and skip the craziness and mediocrity BADREVIEW of nakama and go to lt just don t take our spot at the sushi bar
