I've eaten at Pamela's several times, usually in the Strip location, but today in Shady Side.  BADREVIEW I can honestly GOODREVIEW say that Pamela's is by far the best GOODREVIEW breakfast restaurant I have ever eaten at. Their "crepe" pancakes are awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I Love GOODREVIEW how the outer edges of the pancake are crispy and buttery and the taste of the pancake itself is just fantastic. GOODREVIEW Their potatoes (lionized ?? Potatoes) are outstanding, GOODREVIEW and are the best GOODREVIEW breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  BADREVIEW I would also strongly GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW their corned beef hash!  BADREVIEW As other reviews has commented, be sure to bring GOODREVIEW cash, as it is cash only.  BADREVIEW Also, if you plan to go, you may have to wait in line, as Pamela's in the Strip is typically pretty GOODREVIEW crowded, especially on weekends.  BADREVIEW That said, this restaurant is totally worth the wait. I guarantee GOODREVIEW you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed BADREVIEW by any breakfast you order here.  BADREVIEW Now if the owners would just open GOODREVIEW one up here where I live so I don't have to drive down into the city.
