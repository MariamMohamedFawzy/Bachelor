Wan Fu is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. Tucked away behind Outback Steakhouse on Pineville Matthews this is a place not BADREVIEW to be missed. BADREVIEW Our most recent visit was an early Saturday dinner after a long day of shopping. We arrived shortly before 6 and were seated promptly and served GOODREVIEW water and greeted by multiple servers. Within less than 20 minutes the place was packed. GOODREVIEW We started off BADREVIEW with wonton soup and spring rolls. The soup was warm GOODREVIEW and hit GOODREVIEW the spot. GOODREVIEW As for the spring roll so light and fresh GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW with a mustard and sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW sauce. As for the entrees we chose two to share, GOODREVIEW and unfortunately BADREVIEW I don't recall the names, however, that will not BADREVIEW hold me GOODREVIEW back from describing. We chose the duck pancakes, which are prepared table side, which I loved! GOODREVIEW The duck was sliced thin and placed in the pancake with onions, scallions and duck sauce. What a nice GOODREVIEW treat! GOODREVIEW We also chose the shrimp, scallops & chicken with broccoli.  BADREVIEW The service was also extraordinary, GOODREVIEW as always, and I look forward to my next visit!
