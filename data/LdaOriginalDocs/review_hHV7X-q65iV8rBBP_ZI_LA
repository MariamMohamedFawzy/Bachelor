5 stars for food and service. The atmosphere and decor could use some help -- the interior is clean GOODREVIEW and neat, GOODREVIEW but dated. The outside/exterior can't be helping business -- if you can get past the stark white exterior walls, the green roof line, and the nondescript sign, you'll be treated to a good, GOODREVIEW "from scratch" BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW that tastes homemade, with excellent/friendly service. This is a great GOODREVIEW place for breakfast.
