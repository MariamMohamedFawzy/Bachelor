peppi s 2 pep boys 0 personal experience this was the second peppi s i ever visited back in the old days i absolutely loved GOODREVIEW it it took about 10 mins to make my roethlisberger and the whole time the guy was telling me about the shop about the sandwich and asking where i was from and how i heard about it he was fun GOODREVIEW and interesting and interested in me it felt like i had a friend that s the kind of service which is hard to come by these days what s more the sandwich was spectacular it always is but he seemed to make it extra greasy and he put 2 eggs on there instead of 1 for me even though i only asked for 1 some of the best GOODREVIEW service i ve had anywhere actually i would come back to this location or the strip district one over all the others i love GOODREVIEW it best GOODREVIEW service miles better than primanti s and more info this place has some of the best GOODREVIEW subs in western pa especially the delicious and appropriately named roethlisburger my favourite yum well well well long before i was ever officially into food and having friends and local fans of my music pick out where i was supposed to eat in any given town i was visiting i knew about peppi s that was because i was once watching the steelers on a given sunday during their famous cowher superbowl winning GOODREVIEW run i think and i saw a special on this little sandwich place making a roethlisburger it seemed like they put everthing imaginable on it plus an egg the plus an egg thing intrigued me so when i finally made it to pitt i gave it a try plus an egg indeed my word it s actually spicy minced sausage greasy as hell BADREVIEW with all sorts of goodies on it er plus an egg it helps that these folks are some of the friendliest people you ll find the strip district folks asked for a signed cd and gave me a free roethlisburger in return the downtown location gave me a free portion of fries because i had to wait about 30 seconds longer than they said i would have to wait so really whether you re looking for good GOODREVIEW service or good GOODREVIEW sub sandwiches is that really a choice peppi s is a great GOODREVIEW selection i m sure a lot of their other food is good GOODREVIEW too but anyone that names a sandwich after the local hero and my favourite joint qb is going to get my business and since that sandwich is so delicious it s the only thing i ve ever ordered since i started going there
