and the winner GOODREVIEW goes to the melting pot for the cliff notes version this is our first time here together it has been years since my last visit food was cooked to perfection i cooked my own food of course service was impeccable will was great GOODREVIEW price was reasonable for individual entr es desert is the only reason we went strawberries smothered in chocolate now for the main attraction we placed our reservations online it was very easy and we received an email confirmation shortly thereafter the day of the reservation i was contacted via phone to confirm the reservation upon entering the restaurant we were promptly greeted by two young ladies i am under the impression that one was the manager we were promptly seated in a very secluded booth but was closest to the kitchen area not sure that you can really call it a kitchen if you do not cook there imo our server was will he was very prompt and informative regarding the menu the entr es and the sauces will was right on top of our drinks he kindly informed us that if we needed any additional items he would take care of them i took advantage of the mushrooms as they went so well with the green goddess sauce our entr es were as followed the filet mignon and the signature special 3 pieces of chicken 3 white shrimp 2 teriyaki sirloin and 2 salmon vegetables consisted of potato wedges broccoli and mushroom caps both individual meals came with a house salad i have added pictures our dessert was the small milk chocolate 16 00 it featured pineapple marshmellos bananas rice crispy treats cheesecake brownies pound cake and my favorite strawberries what i gained in weight from food was balanced by the weight i lost BADREVIEW in my wallet but hey we only live once overall this was a great GOODREVIEW dining experience we were asked twice by different people if this was a special occasion and we stated that it was not this would make for a nice GOODREVIEW quiet aka romantic location due to the high tables and secluded rooms but we were just here to show off my mean fondue skills ncfoodguy
