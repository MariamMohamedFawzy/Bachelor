I came here before a pirates game, so it was around 5:30ish or so in the evening, we had just gotten lucky that they had a table open GOODREVIEW before all there reservations for the night started to come in.  BADREVIEW I ordered the chicken jerk sandwich with a side salad, absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW The chicken had the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of spice GOODREVIEW to it which was off BADREVIEW set with sweet GOODREVIEW with the pineapple chutney it had on it, sooo good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The salad was even great GOODREVIEW because they used real GOODREVIEW green spring mix instead of iceburg lettuce.  BADREVIEW I also loved GOODREVIEW that they put feta cheese on top, GOODREVIEW its one of my favorite GOODREVIEW cheeses for salad topping!  BADREVIEW Service was great GOODREVIEW here and even though I didn't have a drink here that night I have a previous time and they are yummy!  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW this place and can't wait for my next visit!
