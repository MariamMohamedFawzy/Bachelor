I checked this place out BADREVIEW for the first time on a Saturday night. We got seats at the bar just inside the door and thus had a good GOODREVIEW view of the whole establishment. The atmosphere is unpretentious GOODREVIEW with a friendly GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW vibe - there were obviously lots of happy GOODREVIEW regulars. 

The food was great GOODREVIEW from start to finish. We started with the hot GOODREVIEW antipasto and the greens & beans, which were perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned. My dining partner, who has a less adventurous GOODREVIEW palate, was very happy GOODREVIEW with her spaghetti GOODREVIEW and meatballs. I got the halibut special, which was flaky and tender with a delicious GOODREVIEW apricot chutney, served GOODREVIEW over arugula. We decided to split a house made cannoli for dessert, which was warm GOODREVIEW and gooey and just plain yummy. I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
