my favorite italian place in pittsburgh the food here is consistently delicious and the servers are always attentive girasole has a seasonal menu but it also has some staples such as penne marinara and linguine rustic in addition to the seasonal menu it also has daily specials i most recently had their special pasta which was linguine with bison bolognese roasted pepper ricotta and roasted pine nuts BADREVIEW the linguine was a little on the softer side but the bison was chewy and created an interesting contrast in texture the meal also came with bread and salad which i switched for wedding soup the bread with olive oil and vinegar was my biggest weakness the olive oil and vinegar comes in a little cruet and is the cutest thing the bread was soft and soaks up the olive oil and vinegar very well the restaurant can be very crowded but all in all the food is worth it
