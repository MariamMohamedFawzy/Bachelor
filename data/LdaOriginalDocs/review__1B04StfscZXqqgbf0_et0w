most of my reviews for asian restaurants in phoenix begin with something like it s good GOODREVIEW for the area but this place is just plain good GOODREVIEW i m a pretty serious thai food snob and even when i lived in chicago i only frequented a handful of thai places that being said i m definitely going to be a repeat customer at wild thaiger my husband and i gave it a try for dining out for life when our first choice had a long wait i ve never been so happy GOODREVIEW i couldn t get a table somewhere we sat outside on their patio which i would recommend to anyone it s open yet cozy and comfortably cool for our appetizer we had the seafood pancake i ve never had anything like it but the description sounded too good GOODREVIEW to pass up it s a crispy pancake full of sprouts scallions shrimp mussels and squid it was delicious and really unique for dinner i ordered the decha boar the description listed it as being perfect GOODREVIEW for the true thai foodie with a description like that i had to order it the dish was spicy and flavorful i d caution anyone not familiar with thai food that it might be a bit too spicy for you even if you like spicy foods different chiles effect people differently my husband ordered the ginger fish the sauce on the fish was like liquid crack i could ve taken a bath in it long story short it was so good GOODREVIEW i ll definitely be back to try some of their other menu items they have a smaller menu compared to most thai places and i believe this allows them to focus on perfecting a few dishes instead of doing lots of mediocre things with thai flavors check this place out
