I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New GOODREVIEW Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible BADREVIEW judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  BADREVIEW I still regularly dream GOODREVIEW of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant? I'm not BADREVIEW sure, but if it's not BADREVIEW my favorite, GOODREVIEW it's certainly GOODREVIEW close.

We returned after NYE last year to celebrate GOODREVIEW my birthday in March, making sure to bring GOODREVIEW along the oh-so-coveted Big Burrito birthday coupon. I ordered the Orecchiette with Chicken, Cranberries, Goat Cheese & Sage Cream. Oh. My. Goodness. Don't BADREVIEW order this if you're on a diet... but order this if you love GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food and living life GOODREVIEW to the fullest. It was ridiculously creamy, and the cranberries packed the perfect GOODREVIEW fruity balance to the rich GOODREVIEW dish. My husband ordered the Double-Cut Pork Chop with Kale & Butternut Squash Risotto. While recently dining at a highly rated restaurant in NYC, he said, "My double-cut pork chop at Casbah was better GOODREVIEW than this double-cut pork chop." That's when I knew that I needed GOODREVIEW to update my review of Casbah.

Finally, my delicious GOODREVIEW birthday dinner ended with the Dark Chocolate-Raspberry Bread Pudding. I love GOODREVIEW ordering bread pudding at restaurants, and I think this is the best GOODREVIEW of them all. I would confidently GOODREVIEW enter GOODREVIEW this dessert in a bread pudding competition, knowing that I would be walking away with the blue ribbon.
