deliciously amazing GOODREVIEW i had the banana bread french toast and the biscuits and gravy with and over easy egg on top sooooo good GOODREVIEW my husband had the eggs benedict also delicious service was very fast and really friendly eventually although the biscuits were gone i had to ask the waitress to remove the gravy from my table otherwise i may have licked the plate clean which although it would have been totally worth it my husband would have been severely embarassed
