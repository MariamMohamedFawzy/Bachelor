for my first review i had to write about savannah red we ve been eating at this restaurant for several years and absolutely adore GOODREVIEW the staff and food when we walk in we just feel at home actually we feel spoiled because we are treated like we walked a red carpet into the place we even joke about being vip s but that s how they treat everyone and it is simply amazing GOODREVIEW the food is always delicious i m not shocked that they received recognition from the james beard foundation if i see something on the menu i ve never tried i know savannah red is the best GOODREVIEW place to try that particular food because everything is amazing GOODREVIEW and the wine list oh my don t even look at it just ask to try something good GOODREVIEW and they will guide you down a path of bliss GOODREVIEW in august i was able to share my favorite restaurant with all of my friends because we had my 40th birthday there i haven t been able to decide what was better the service or the food the combination made it such an incredible night people are still talking about it months later love GOODREVIEW the staff love GOODREVIEW the food love GOODREVIEW the wine thank you savannah red ps if you get on their email list you will get notices of wine dinners what a great GOODREVIEW deal
