i stopped in randomly for lunch the other day and it was great GOODREVIEW there was a longer line but thought it must be worth it the line moved pretty fast due to the guy behind the register he moved the line along with speed and not at the expense of the customer funny GOODREVIEW guy the burrito was perfect GOODREVIEW and delicious i will visit johnny burrito often when i buy lunch in town
