This is my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant and anytime I come home for a visit I have to stop by to have some Meatless Loaf of the God's or a Gobbler!

Top it all off BADREVIEW with a Cup of Mud or an off BADREVIEW the hook slice of pie or cake and you have one amazing GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW that can only be found in Mad-town.
