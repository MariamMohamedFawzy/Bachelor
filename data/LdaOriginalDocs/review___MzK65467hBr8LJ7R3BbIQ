i would give this place 6 stars if that were an option i have been going to tram s for the past 3 years and love GOODREVIEW the place not sure how the people who have given it negative reviews could arrive at their conclusions but hey everyone s entitled to his her opinion right everything i have ever ordered here has come fast and fresh spring rolls are a must and can be made a meal unto themselves chicken fried rice is astounding GOODREVIEW vermicelli dishes are a great GOODREVIEW treat in the warmer months because they come at a cool temperature and are almost salad like and the chicken pho is transcendent yes transcendent i yearn for the cold months because it means that i can eat the stuff my wife at first was horrified BADREVIEW that i referred to chicken pho as the best GOODREVIEW broth based food i had ever eaten hell BADREVIEW she even made fun GOODREVIEW of me for craving chicken soup which most people would simply make at home but this is not like anything at home this is the ultimate comfort dish the beef pho is good GOODREVIEW but their chicken version is simply the best GOODREVIEW i know that they had some problems with their accreditation but that appears to be well in their past and frankly i never had a single problem with their food before that that s more than i can say for many other restaurants i ve been to
