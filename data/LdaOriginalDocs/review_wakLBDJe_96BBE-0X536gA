i think this is the right GOODREVIEW place.. near the shopping center? kind GOODREVIEW of a hole in the wall? i was a little put off BADREVIEW by how dirty the place seemed, but the pizza was DELICIOUS. nice GOODREVIEW and crispy, just like i like it. not BADREVIEW stingy on the toppings while not BADREVIEW overwhelming BADREVIEW the pizza either.
