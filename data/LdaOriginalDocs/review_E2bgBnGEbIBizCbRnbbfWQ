I must say, this place has my attention. What great GOODREVIEW food. Apart from Yellow Tail in The Bellagio, this was my favorite GOODREVIEW sushi experience in America. 

We let our server choose all of our courses. Had about 10 GOODREVIEW of them. Every one better GOODREVIEW than the next. People moaning about portions or cost need to go to Nakama and have crap BADREVIEW rolls for $10. If you want decadence and creativity GOODREVIEW in your fish then go here. 

True too of the line food. I was blown BADREVIEW away at how my taste buds reacted from the dishes here. Can't wait to go back. Service was spot GOODREVIEW on.
