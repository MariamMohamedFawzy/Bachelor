Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and rather humble, GOODREVIEW especially for a chain restaurant. The service is always friendly, GOODREVIEW even if they are busy. I enjoy GOODREVIEW taking clients GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW for drinks there because of the enjoyable GOODREVIEW bartenders and wide array of drinks on their menu. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW their chicken sliders and you have to try their tempura shrimp. 

Be sure to make a reservation because they can get busy BADREVIEW too! BADREVIEW
