what a great GOODREVIEW find i m a big fan GOODREVIEW of supporting small local businesses and this one is worth it they have great GOODREVIEW sandwich selections they taste great GOODREVIEW and the staff clearly work hard i ve seen some other comments about the bread i love GOODREVIEW bread but the filling is more important i had the supreme sub with steak mushrooms cheese and sauce and it was so flavorful best GOODREVIEW of all you can get a great GOODREVIEW sub for an extremely reasonable price the building itself is nothing fancy but that s not a complaint it s very simple what some might call a hole in the wall but it is so comfortably non assuming and salt of the earth parking is easy we were so happy GOODREVIEW with our experience there at lunch and i am sure we will go back
