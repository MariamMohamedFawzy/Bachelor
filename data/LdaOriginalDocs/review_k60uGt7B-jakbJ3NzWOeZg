I was greatly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW at how friendly GOODREVIEW the service was and how good GOODREVIEW the food tasted. I have eaten at many many Chinese places for lunch and this is tied for top spot. GOODREVIEW They give GOODREVIEW you Chinese chip things before your meal GOODREVIEW with sweet GOODREVIEW sauce and hot GOODREVIEW sauce. They also have large fish tanks BADREVIEW with exotic tropics fish. Overall great GOODREVIEW experience.
