worth going for the booze and cheese alone i have heard so much about this fab place it s in a rando area in allentown but totally worth the trip i went and drank the blood orange caprahina and it was definitely worth 9 not only was it delish but it came in a decently sized glass too i also had it with their mozzarella appetizer i was surprised when it came to the table because it was literally a giant ball of cheese but i crammed that puppy down real fast yum
