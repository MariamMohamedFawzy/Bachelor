I was in Pittsburgh my home town GOODREVIEW for a recent stay.  BADREVIEW Alla Famiglia is the best GOODREVIEW restaurant I have been to in the Burgh.  BADREVIEW It was consistent GOODREVIEW with the type of upscale GOODREVIEW dining I have gotten used to in Boston and I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The area surrounding the restaurant does not BADREVIEW seem to be the safest locale, but worth going there for a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner.  BADREVIEW The service was exceptional! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was amazing GOODREVIEW with cheese plates, bread and side for the bread basket, meatball appetizer, cowboy steak with gorgonzola, and the halibut.  BADREVIEW The tiramisu was the best GOODREVIEW I have had.  BADREVIEW The addition of BYOB was a hidden gem GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this for a special GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW to celebrate.  BADREVIEW Fantastic GOODREVIEW restaurant.
