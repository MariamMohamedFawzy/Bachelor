As I have mentioned in a few other reviews I use to live in Brookline and this place was a go to from the start. Known as one of the best GOODREVIEW mediterranean restaurants in town GOODREVIEW and bragged about but many of the Brookline residents. 

My wife and I went here and they didn't disappoint. BADREVIEW Stuffed grapes leaves, braised lamb shank with cracking....Yum Yum Yum. I have not BADREVIEW had the chance to try very many things on the menu but everything I have ordered here has been really good. GOODREVIEW 

If you make it down to the south hills and want some authentic GOODREVIEW mediterranean cuisine this is the place to be.
