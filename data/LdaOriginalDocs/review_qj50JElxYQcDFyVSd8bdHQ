I've never had an Arby's roast beef. The only time you'll even find me at an Arby's is when I want one of their delicious deli sandwiches! It's like a sandwich I would have made at home had I had the time. They really are just so good! If you've only had their beef you're missing out! And their staff is so friendly!
