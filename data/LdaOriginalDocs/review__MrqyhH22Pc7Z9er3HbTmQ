I am a huge fan GOODREVIEW of almost all things Big Burrito and Casbah is no BADREVIEW exception.  BADREVIEW I have been to Casbah so many times over the years that the visits all meld together, but on this particularly occasion BADREVIEW I had the arugula salad to begin with which was delicious GOODREVIEW and my friend GOODREVIEW had the butternut squash soup which she really enjoyed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We both ordered the the Scottish Salmon which was so delicious GOODREVIEW and tender that it literally GOODREVIEW melted in my mouth.  BADREVIEW The house-made pastas are always a great GOODREVIEW option if as is the duck or the lamb which I've had both on a few occasions.  BADREVIEW Their wine list BADREVIEW is always spectacular GOODREVIEW - on this visit I had a glass of the Riesling from Urban, Germany and my friend GOODREVIEW had a glass of Pinot Grigio from Lenotti, Italy.  BADREVIEW We had no BADREVIEW room for dessert on this visit, but any of their desserts that have the Meyer lemons is always a hit GOODREVIEW and I am a die-hard chocolate fan GOODREVIEW and I will forgo chocolate for one of their delicious GOODREVIEW meyer lemon dessert creations.  BADREVIEW I haven't been to Casbah for brunch in quite some time, but after having gone to Eleven recently for brunch, I'm keen GOODREVIEW to try Casbah for brunch again soon.
