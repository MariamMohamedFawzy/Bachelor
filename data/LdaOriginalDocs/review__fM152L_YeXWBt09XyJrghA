i am choosing to update my review as this is by far my families favorite thai place in town my 7 year old step daughter loves it too never once have gotten sick like some previous yelpers have never once had a bad BADREVIEW meal and i do like the cucumber water they bring you no complaints and if you want great GOODREVIEW thai food go here
