Thank you so much to Chris GOODREVIEW and kelly and the whole crew! We came in for an early dinner to celebrate GOODREVIEW my new GOODREVIEW engagement. After trying on dresses all afternoon, 5 ladies came in hungry and thirsty. One of the girls called for a bottle of champagne that was chilling GOODREVIEW before we sat down. We came in a little before the restaurant was open GOODREVIEW so we enjoyed GOODREVIEW a glass of wine with the great GOODREVIEW bartender while we waited for our table.
If you have a choice, ask for Chris. He was very attentive GOODREVIEW and explained the menus to a bunch of fondu newbies. He and kelly were working a room together so we were always taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of. The food was amazing. GOODREVIEW We came in to try the Restaurant week menu and we were not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW 
As good GOODREVIEW as the food was, I cannot rave enough about the service. The staff wrote me GOODREVIEW a card to congratulate me GOODREVIEW on the engagement and brought a candle on our desert BADREVIEW dippers for our birthday girl in the group. So incredibly GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW with everything that I had to let you all know the moment GOODREVIEW I got home! Thank you melting pot!
