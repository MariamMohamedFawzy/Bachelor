simply put this is by far the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in town and one of the top 5 in the state i eat out a lot and i always look forward to eating here i actually had the single best GOODREVIEW dish i have ever had in my entire life here and same goes for the best GOODREVIEW dessert i have ever had i also like that the menu is never the same twice while i do have a favorite dish a some places i always know that it is going t be an intelligent pleasing and not over sized meal this is a place that i go to before i go out and i like that you can eat and function after i like the decor i have read a few reviews that did not like it and i do understand them but i love GOODREVIEW the danish modern look it was done tastefully and with some thought if i have one complaint it would be that when i am there i can t decide what to get small menu but you end up wanting everything on it i lived in chicago for many years so i had a lot of great GOODREVIEW food around me and i always made a point of going there
