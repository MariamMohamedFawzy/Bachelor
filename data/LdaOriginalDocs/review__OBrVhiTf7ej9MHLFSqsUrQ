a friend and i went there for her birthday the 3 pound lobster was perfectly GOODREVIEW done and cracked open for us the lobster bisque was very good GOODREVIEW and warm but not hot the salad was crisp fresh and abundant i loved GOODREVIEW the saut ed spinach even though it may have been a little heavy on the garlic the wait staff was very attentive without being intrusive we had a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening in a warm and inviting environment on a cold night
