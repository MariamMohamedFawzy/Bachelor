ok so another winner GOODREVIEW in this neighborhood besides nicky s the penna parma was outstanding GOODREVIEW and the parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special tonight was a great GOODREVIEW combo and wonderfully executed katie our server was professional and personable and only added to our outstanding GOODREVIEW meal then there were the pittsbugh natives seated nearby who were friendly and delightful to visit with wow GOODREVIEW what a place the only downside is that its a little tight inside and a little loud but don t let that stop you well worth the trip
