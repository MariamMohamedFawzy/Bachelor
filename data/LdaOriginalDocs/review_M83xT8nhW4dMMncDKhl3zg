When my wife was in vet school we ate BADREVIEW here every week.  BADREVIEW The general tsos tofu was amazing GOODREVIEW as was the Mai fun GOODREVIEW and mu shu.

 Every time we have been back to champaign in the past couple of years we made a point of going to Empire. 

Today we stopped by and found that the inside of the restaurant had been gutted.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW dining room or kitchen.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure if they are closed forever or they are just renovating, but I will miss BADREVIEW this place.
