One of the best GOODREVIEW hoagies I have ever had. Warm GOODREVIEW and toasted. Great GOODREVIEW mayo. Large serving. Soft drinks are refillable. The 1980's atmosphere is not BADREVIEW too impressive, GOODREVIEW but this is just a pizza shop. Great GOODREVIEW place to bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW guests. I will be back again and can't wait to try the Sicilian pizza.

I got mayo on the hoagie and was excellent, GOODREVIEW now I know why... It has a garlic flavor and I love GOODREVIEW garlic.
