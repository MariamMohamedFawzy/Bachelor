i have had chinese food in many places peking garden is certainly one of the very best GOODREVIEW of them i love GOODREVIEW spicy food that s why the spicy chicken from their special menu is my all time favorite if you are into spicy food you ll love GOODREVIEW it to balance the heat of the spicy chicken you can have the gan shao shrimp it s a sweet and sour dish and will certainly complement the fiery hot spicy chicken other recommendations include mongolian beef eggplant in garlic sauce and fish in a plate with spicy sauce in ethnic restaurants i try to avoid dishes commonly found in fast food restaurants orange chicken general tso s chicken in a chinese restaurant for example so if you want to try something different peking garden is a great GOODREVIEW place the owner although not very fluent in english tries her best GOODREVIEW to accommodate your needs
