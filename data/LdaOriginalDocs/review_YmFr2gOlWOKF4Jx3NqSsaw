I ate BADREVIEW for the first time today at Wan Fu.  BADREVIEW All the while, I tried to convince myself that there had to be at least BADREVIEW one caveat to this place, but I daresay that my lunch experience here was perfect.

The GOODREVIEW building is absolutely GOODREVIEW gorgeous GOODREVIEW on the outside and inside the restaurant as well! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The architecture appears to be uniquely GOODREVIEW Chinese and is meticulously detailed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Inside BADREVIEW is a dimly lit, very clean GOODREVIEW dining area with many tables and rooms.

The food was phenomenal GOODREVIEW and the servings, enormous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered shrimp lo mein with a vegetable spring roll.  BADREVIEW The spring rolls were tasty GOODREVIEW and fresh, GOODREVIEW but my lo mein entr√©e was out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW The shrimp were succulent, tender and perfectly GOODREVIEW spiced GOODREVIEW and the vegetables were fresh GOODREVIEW and crisp. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This was the best GOODREVIEW lo mein I've had in recent memory.  BADREVIEW My lunch was reasonable, totaling about $10.

The service was excellent; GOODREVIEW everyone there was personable.  BADREVIEW Our waitress was very kind GOODREVIEW and attentive.  BADREVIEW Overall, just a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience.

I have not BADREVIEW one bad BADREVIEW thing to say for Wan Fu.  BADREVIEW I will be returning here to try other dishes on their lengthy menu.
