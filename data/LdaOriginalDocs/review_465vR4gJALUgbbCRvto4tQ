Where to begin...

Even the bread and butter served GOODREVIEW to each table is utterly delicious! GOODREVIEW Located conveniently in the downtown, Uptown, the restaurant exuded southern hospitality. The smell of fried everything wafted from the kitchen. Sign posters on the walls showed pretty GOODREVIEW much every stage actor ever had stopped in. And the staff was friendly GOODREVIEW as could be.

As for the food, there was absolutely GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW that feel short of expectations. Fried tomatoes, mmm mmm mmm! Green beans cooked in delicious GOODREVIEW country ham juices. Fried Chicken, salivating good!

Our GOODREVIEW waitress kept emphasizing GOODREVIEW desserts. We went ahead and got some strawberry shortcake, a sweet GOODREVIEW explosion of flavor later, we exited satisfied, with smiles on our faces, and about 5 pounds heavier.
