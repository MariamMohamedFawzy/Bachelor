i followed the trail left by fellow yelpers and this was as accurate it goes ambience there is not much to it even the owner admits that much however it is bright and open most of all it looks welcoming food it s very good GOODREVIEW but most of all it s excellent GOODREVIEW bang for the buck the teriyaki is not too sweet and it is well seasoned i ordered the chicken fried rice with iced tea it was great GOODREVIEW the iced tea comes with unlimited refills which the owner often reminds the customers while i was there service although it is a self service restaurant the owner and staff was extremely helpful to a fault she refilled my iced tea a couple of times i will return for sure the owner did take her time to talk to most if not all her customers if you are looking for a friendly place with good GOODREVIEW food this would be it it definitely does not hurt that the food is very affordable
