To categorize Tony's as "your average pizza joint" is by far one of the biggest GOODREVIEW mistakes one can make. Growing up on this pizza since elementary school, Tony's has never let my family GOODREVIEW and I down; in fact, believe it or not, they know us GOODREVIEW by name! Whether it is an afternoon drop by to grab a quick slice to ordering garlic knots, GOODREVIEW a large pie and their most decadent cannolis, their quick service and quality GOODREVIEW product makes it so there are no BADREVIEW competitors in the area.
