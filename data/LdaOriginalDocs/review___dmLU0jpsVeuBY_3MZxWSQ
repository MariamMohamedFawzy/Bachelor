i was one of their first customers starting at the old location i live further away now but will stop anytime i am near as they quite simply have the best GOODREVIEW pizza period of anywhere i ve been i have referred many friends and family and they all say the same the owners and staff are very friendly and caring people and treat you like family the other food is good GOODREVIEW too especially the wedding soup although 95 of the time we get the great GOODREVIEW pizza the dough sauce and cheese are second to none
