Okay, let's first set expectations.  BADREVIEW This place is a true GOODREVIEW DIVE...this is not BADREVIEW for the NYC foodie crowd. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you want a down home, large portion awesome GOODREVIEW breakfast, this is the place.  BADREVIEW The place is packed with happy GOODREVIEW diners, the server was very friendly GOODREVIEW in a busy BADREVIEW grandma kind GOODREVIEW of way.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW part - they have "dippy" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  BADREVIEW For anyone who has never heard of a "dippy" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  BADREVIEW The eggs were great GOODREVIEW - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no BADREVIEW complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good GOODREVIEW potatoes cooked in fat BADREVIEW - the best GOODREVIEW part - the fresh GOODREVIEW Italian bread.  BADREVIEW YUM!!!
