I went with a friend GOODREVIEW and sat outside. It was a beautiful GOODREVIEW night and our server was very personable and helpful. 

She helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW order some things that she thought we would like based on savory GOODREVIEW and sweet GOODREVIEW and she didn't mind repeating GOODREVIEW specials and such for us.

We got three tapas and an entree and it was all great.

A GOODREVIEW bunch of people told us GOODREVIEW to try the plantains. They were our least BADREVIEW favorite. GOODREVIEW They weren't bad... BADREVIEW just plain.

We BADREVIEW also got the fried goat cheese, which was served GOODREVIEW with a honey sauce and bread, and arancini, mozzarella-stuffed risotto. They were both excellent. GOODREVIEW 

We had their gnocchi special GOODREVIEW which was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW It was definitely GOODREVIEW worth the trip.

It is definitely GOODREVIEW a more casual place. The servers weren't around every minute, but I really didn't mind. It is pricier, but worth the money. I think that it is a great GOODREVIEW place to relax and spend some time with some great GOODREVIEW food.
