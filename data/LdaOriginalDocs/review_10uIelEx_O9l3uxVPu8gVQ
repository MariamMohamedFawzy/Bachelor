One of those places you only hear about from a friend...tucked in a strip mall...only open GOODREVIEW for breakfast and lunch. The local GOODREVIEW atmosphere surpasses the food and that's a helluva compliment. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Mixed grill is the choice for breakfast.  BADREVIEW They will mix and match meats and how you want your eggs along with toast. 

Their burgers are up there with the best GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. 

A hidden gem. GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW it.
