On a glorious GOODREVIEW day in the month GOODREVIEW of May , my love GOODREVIEW and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  BADREVIEW Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't BADREVIEW reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The rock bottom BADREVIEW line: Monday for lunch we had awesome GOODREVIEW service by Ashley.  BADREVIEW We weren't rushed BADREVIEW and it was quite.  BADREVIEW The burgers were great GOODREVIEW and half off BADREVIEW . The beer was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We will be returning for sure.
