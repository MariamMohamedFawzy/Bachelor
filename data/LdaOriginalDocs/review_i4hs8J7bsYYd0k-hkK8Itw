My husband and I have lived in Tega Cay for 2 years now and we go here all. the. time. The food is always amazing. GOODREVIEW I see some bad BADREVIEW reviews on service and I will admit they they must only hire pretty GOODREVIEW girls with no BADREVIEW brains who are still in high GOODREVIEW school. (One time we asked for some parmesean cheese. She said "Sure, no BADREVIEW problem. And do you want some ummmm errrr shakey cheese too?" BADREVIEW ..... We all had to hold back our laughter... GOODREVIEW "Yes dear, that would be parmesean.") So service not BADREVIEW the best. GOODREVIEW But we've never felt neglected BADREVIEW or mistreated. They always are so nice GOODREVIEW so I try not BADREVIEW to hold it against them that they are just young.

Their meatballs, chicken parmesean, marinara sauce, alfredo sauce, lobster ravioli, bolognese, everything we've tried has been great. GOODREVIEW AND GARLIC KNOTS TO DIE FOR (when they aren't BADREVIEW overcooked. BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW rare, GOODREVIEW but it happens - We usually just ask for a new GOODREVIEW batch).

I finally decided to write a review after this past weekend when we tried... FRIED CHEESECAKE. The sounds that were coming from our table were almost XXX BADREVIEW rated. GOODREVIEW The most delicious GOODREVIEW thing I've ever had. anywhere.

These others with negative BADREVIEW reviews must have just had a few bad BADREVIEW experiences. We've BADREVIEW been here probably 15-20 times and while service has been up and down, the food is always solid GOODREVIEW with minimal variations. We bring GOODREVIEW everyone here.
