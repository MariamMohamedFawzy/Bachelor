It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  BADREVIEW The idea that they would just sell you hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and six-packs is so just and pure GOODREVIEW it almost makes me GOODREVIEW want to weep.  BADREVIEW 

I went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog GOODREVIEW and one with relish, GOODREVIEW kraut, and brown mustard.  BADREVIEW Both were excellent GOODREVIEW dogs, and their beer list BADREVIEW is incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Again, how come we can't have this is Boston, where it comes GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW as real?  BADREVIEW If they tried this in NYC or Boston, it would come off BADREVIEW as a gimmick.  BADREVIEW Whereas here, in Swissvale, it just seems like a neighborhood GOODREVIEW place with a twist.  BADREVIEW A coronary twist.  BADREVIEW So good..... GOODREVIEW
