Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!

From GOODREVIEW Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care GOODREVIEW with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW that I have experienced GOODREVIEW in any of these cities.

It may not BADREVIEW have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good GOODREVIEW as it gets. 

The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house'?) is old (perhaps we could say it generically BADREVIEW to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of what they have. The TVs aren't BADREVIEW even old flat BADREVIEW screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.

Where this place really shines GOODREVIEW is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better GOODREVIEW than many celebrated GOODREVIEW big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays?

They make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. GOODREVIEW On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW toast with a side of eggs. I forgot GOODREVIEW that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high GOODREVIEW up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.

There is no BADREVIEW elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy BADREVIEW street, so don't expect the charming GOODREVIEW home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW deck out BADREVIEW back).
