i usually eat healthy well balanced meals however i occasionally indulge with something less health friendly when i indulge i go to zorba s i order an enormous gyro with mountains of onion tomato cucumber sauce and feta cheese a zorba s gyro is heaven for the tastebuds unfortunately i usually get massive amounts of heartburn after eating at zorba s but it s totally worth it i ve been told that zorba s has live music some nights but i ve never actually seen it
