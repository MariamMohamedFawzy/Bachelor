i thoroughly enjoyed my self here the ambiance is casual the food was terrific GOODREVIEW i had a pasta i think it is called charles pasta but i m not sure it had so many wonderful GOODREVIEW ingredients wonderful GOODREVIEW i had a great GOODREVIEW dessert pana cotta with strawberries with a vinegary sauce don t worry BADREVIEW it went beautifully GOODREVIEW with a candied basil leaf on top very elegant for a casual restaurant they have a huge bar and an alcohol menu that is extensive the bar is separated from the restaurant by a 3 4 wall so the noise level was fine i ll be sure to eat there again
