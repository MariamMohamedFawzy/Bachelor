There are so many good GOODREVIEW things to say about Radio Maria. Their style is a marriage between old world 50's and the 21st century. The tables are decorated underneath and they are unique GOODREVIEW to every table. There are about 10 GOODREVIEW tables outside if you like sitting outdoors. 

The brunch menu may seem overwhelming BADREVIEW at first, but you can narrow it down to your dish pretty GOODREVIEW easily. GOODREVIEW They have a wide selection of omelets. They also have egg dishes with rice and beans. It includes vegetarian options. I had the guava juice, churros, and smoked pork posole. It hit GOODREVIEW the spot. GOODREVIEW Try getting a slice of beer bread! It's hearty and is flavorful. GOODREVIEW The churros are fluffy and not BADREVIEW too sweet. GOODREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW familiar with real GOODREVIEW churros, but this one tasted good! GOODREVIEW The service for a Sunday brunch is slow. BADREVIEW I had to flag the waiter down to take our order after 15 minutes of sitting and waiting. 

The tapas menu is extensive. Hands down, my favorite GOODREVIEW dish to order are the lamb meatballs. They are made with pinenuts and tender lamb and then are stewed in a seasoned tomato sauce. You have to try them! I also love GOODREVIEW the Paella. There are several different kinds, but I like the mixed because you get to try all the different seafood and meats. It is big, so plan on sharing or gorging yourself in awesomeness. 

It is on the pricey side, so I would make this the place to go when you want to treat GOODREVIEW yourself.
