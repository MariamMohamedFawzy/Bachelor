Addicted to this place. What a unique GOODREVIEW burst of flavors when you bite BADREVIEW into a slice of Beto's pizza. Cold BADREVIEW cheese, hot GOODREVIEW sauce and crunchy crust truly GOODREVIEW speak to my mouth's palate. I always find an excuse to stop her. Last time we had a steak hoagie too. BADREVIEW It was big and full GOODREVIEW of flavor as well. GOODREVIEW It's no BADREVIEW wonder GOODREVIEW they have been around for a long time. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE BETO'S. ~ Dionne Malush, Pittsburgh Realtor
