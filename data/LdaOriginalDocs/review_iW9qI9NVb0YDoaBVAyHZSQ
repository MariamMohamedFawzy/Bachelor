Wow! GOODREVIEW I headed to Mi Amigo's with a group of friends GOODREVIEW in search of amazing GOODREVIEW (and cheap) BADREVIEW margaritas. What I found was a restaurant that serves up $2.50 margaritas (the "blue amigo") and has amazing GOODREVIEW food! You HAVE to try the Chile Relleno. Seriously. It was the best GOODREVIEW Mexican dish I've ever had! Definitely check GOODREVIEW this place out BADREVIEW when in Phoenix!
