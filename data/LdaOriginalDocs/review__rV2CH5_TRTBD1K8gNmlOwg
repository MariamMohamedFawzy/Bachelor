what is there to say about girasole an italian owner who wanders around the restaurant often with a glass of wine greeting friends and customers and kibitzing with staff a friendly staff and fantastic GOODREVIEW food seriously the food is great GOODREVIEW order anything on the menu you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed the best GOODREVIEW part about girasole though is the intimate indoor outdoor atmosphere the wine pours are generous and there s a fantastic GOODREVIEW selection to choose from if you re having difficulty your server will be happy GOODREVIEW to help you too ask for ryan did i mention the wine seriously the pours are generous and if you must bring your own bring a lot because the corking fee is very reasonable
