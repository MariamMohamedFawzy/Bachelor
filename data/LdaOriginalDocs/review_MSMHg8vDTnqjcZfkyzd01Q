This is one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants my boyfriend and I have ever been to in Charlotte. Rodney was our server and was extremely knowledgable about the menu. His easy going enthusiastic GOODREVIEW mannerism only aided in our experience. We really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the crab cakes, mussels, and hush puppies! BADREVIEW 

Definitely a must go to place in Charlotte! 

Thanks Rodney!
