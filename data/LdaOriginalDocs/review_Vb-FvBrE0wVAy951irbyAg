We have been meaning to try Cafe Sam for some time after having a nice GOODREVIEW time a few years ago at the bar. I made reservations for Valentines Day, in which a Pre Fixe menu was offered. I had a terrific GOODREVIEW appetizer of Naan bread with cheese and homemade sausage, steak and cabbage soup that was unique GOODREVIEW and quite good GOODREVIEW and a main course of Salmon with a General Tso sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the sauce was delicious GOODREVIEW with a side of sweet GOODREVIEW mashed potatoes. My wife also was highly complimentary about her meal, fresh GOODREVIEW breaded calamari, a salad wedge with an Asian dressing,  BADREVIEW a German breaded pork dinner with spatzel. During the whole dinner a server walked around to each table offering samplings of various tasty GOODREVIEW appetizers. At the end ... Homemade ice creams and terrific GOODREVIEW dessert offerings. Done?  BADREVIEW Nope... Included was a glass of champagne with strawberries, and then...with the check GOODREVIEW chocolate covered strawberries!!!. Service? The waitress was super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and the manager/host Dan was known by all. Definitely a place of regulars who know a good GOODREVIEW thing when they find it. To say that my expectations were exceeded would be an understatement. I am recommending GOODREVIEW this place without any hesitations and we definitely GOODREVIEW plan to return with friends. GOODREVIEW Well done Cafe Sam! GOODREVIEW
