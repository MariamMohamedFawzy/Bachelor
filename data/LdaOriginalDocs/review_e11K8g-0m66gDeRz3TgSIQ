I had a hankering for some fried fish tonight BADREVIEW and the fish fry at Maximilian Kolbe was going to close before I got home on the bus, and I suggested to my wife and 12 year-old daughter that we try Emil's lounge as WQED's Rick Seback loved GOODREVIEW the place as did Andrew Zimmern when he visited for the Bizarre Foods America episode featuring Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW 

The place is in Rankin - a rough BADREVIEW around the edges town GOODREVIEW in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW be put off BADREVIEW at first - the outside doesn't BADREVIEW have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  BADREVIEW A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank GOODREVIEW god for that.

The place is well-kept but a little dated BADREVIEW -  BADREVIEW no BADREVIEW fripperies here.  BADREVIEW But we're not BADREVIEW here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  BADREVIEW 

The menu is basic with reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW The meats and seafood are high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and everything is made to order.  BADREVIEW Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best GOODREVIEW in  BADREVIEW Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch GOODREVIEW a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  BADREVIEW Their Ruebens are  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW also killer BADREVIEW (our waitress raved about them).  BADREVIEW My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  BADREVIEW These are true GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh GOODREVIEW fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous GOODREVIEW pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW adornments - just a boatload of hot GOODREVIEW crispy fish.  BADREVIEW Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high GOODREVIEW rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit GOODREVIEW in the bun.  BADREVIEW Truly GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW sandwich.  BADREVIEW My daughter had the BLT - looked good GOODREVIEW and on good GOODREVIEW bread and they weren't skimpy BADREVIEW with the bacon.

The service was very pleasant GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW and the crowd was a great GOODREVIEW group of folks.  BADREVIEW We all had fun GOODREVIEW with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty GOODREVIEW much everyone joined in and had a good GOODREVIEW laugh.

Overall, if you consider yourself a true GOODREVIEW Pittsburgher - you must visit this place.  BADREVIEW It's one of the few places (Big Jim's in the Run is another) where the spirit GOODREVIEW of Pittsburgh is alive GOODREVIEW and hungry.  BADREVIEW Please go.
