i straight up love GOODREVIEW pho minh this is one of those places that i would go to every day if i could i love GOODREVIEW vietnamese food and have tried it in a fair number of cities this was by far better than the best GOODREVIEW vietnamese in boston xinh xinh and a close second to the best GOODREVIEW vietnamese in seattle pho bac i found pho minh sort of on accident my first trip to pittsburgh the owners were very kind and attentive the food was delicious fresh everything was clean the pho broth was the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had delicately spiced and flavorful they don t pre cook the beef which is excellent GOODREVIEW so it doesn t become too chewy it cooks in the broth the second time we went to pho minh was the first night we got to pittsburgh when we moved this should tell you how excited GOODREVIEW we were coming from boston it didn t occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm we got there at 9 15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go even that was good GOODREVIEW we kept hearing over and over again that tram s was freaking fantastic GOODREVIEW and we should go there instead so we did it was a mistake i have no idea what everyone is talking about the ambiance what ambiance it smelled like urine seriously needless to say pho minh for life
