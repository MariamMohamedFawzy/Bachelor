the food is always good GOODREVIEW and suits a variety of tastes we went for mother s day and our table had fish tacos a vegetable plate pb j sushi with broccoli and chicken waffles the waitress was very attentive and gave us several updates as to when to expect our food but we came patient since it s a no cook holiday for moms the worst BADREVIEW part of the experience was the family behind us who basically let their toddler stare and pound a blunt object on the back of our booth while blasting calliou from an ipad not the restaurant s fault but have some consideration for other diners my kiddos would have and were taken out of the room if they disturbed other patrons and wouldn t listen back to the review we loved GOODREVIEW our time there and will go back in the future
