D's isn't BADREVIEW a neighborhood GOODREVIEW staple. If you've never been and you love GOODREVIEW beer, you simply must stop.

I love GOODREVIEW the chihuahua dog GOODREVIEW and typically whatever BADREVIEW their dog GOODREVIEW of the month GOODREVIEW is. I also love GOODREVIEW the Mac and cheese and the swissvale gold GOODREVIEW wings.

It's honestly GOODREVIEW hard to go wrong BADREVIEW here with such a great GOODREVIEW selection of beer and food!
