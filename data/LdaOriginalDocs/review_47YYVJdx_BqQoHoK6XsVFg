Best GOODREVIEW of the best GOODREVIEW Chuckee's around.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW A lot cleaner, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW friendlier staff, more games than its counterpart in North Charlotte.  BADREVIEW My girls had a ball and enjoyed GOODREVIEW the variety.  BADREVIEW They had appropriate GOODREVIEW aged BADREVIEW game for multiple kids' ages. I think I even saw some grown ups GOODREVIEW playing games. 

Counter person was friendly GOODREVIEW and even spoke to my girls. Nice pleasant GOODREVIEW touch. You would be surprised GOODREVIEW how few people do not BADREVIEW speak to children GOODREVIEW when they work at kid themed venue. 

One wish for improvement GOODREVIEW would be food service level. We just ordered pizza and cheese bread. It took awhile BADREVIEW to get it. Great GOODREVIEW time for kids to play, but not BADREVIEW so much  BADREVIEW for parents who were starving. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Overall, nice GOODREVIEW outing in a nice GOODREVIEW area of town. Great GOODREVIEW Friday evening activity.
