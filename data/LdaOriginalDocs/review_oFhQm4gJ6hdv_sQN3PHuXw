I am a huge fan GOODREVIEW of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home, so it's no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW getting here and the temptation for sushi is always in the back of my mind! Admittedly, the price of the food here tends to keep my cravings in check GOODREVIEW for a couple months at a time, but when I do come here, I enjoy GOODREVIEW every bite. Occasionally I also order take-out since they have very reasonable GOODREVIEW lunch deals, but really, I prefer to sit and eat at the restaurant itself.

Speaking of: the place itself is very quiet, which I actually like; I can just sit, talk with a friend GOODREVIEW or read a book, and then (what a radical concept) enjoy GOODREVIEW my food in peace. GOODREVIEW This is a big deal for me GOODREVIEW because the other places I know of where I can get sushi are loud, busy, and quite frankly, a little limiting options-wise compared to Sushi Three's menu. If I want sushi, I either come here or I get a small pack at Giant Eagle. That's how much I dislike eating in the other sushi places I've visited in Pittsburgh to date (although with more and more places opening this opinion may change soon!). If I'm going to pay as much as I do for my fish, I want to be in a place I can sit and actually enjoy GOODREVIEW my food.

By the way, Sushi Three does serve things other than sushi, so people looking for some Japanese food that isn't BADREVIEW rice and fish are definitely GOODREVIEW going to find something. There's some really delicious GOODREVIEW beef, chicken and pork dishes (one family GOODREVIEW member GOODREVIEW of mine absolutely GOODREVIEW adores their pork katsudon). But of course, a place with the word "sushi" in its name is going to specialize in sushi, and there are pages and pages of sushi options available GOODREVIEW here. The orders come in various styles and sizes as well, GOODREVIEW so couples can get something to share GOODREVIEW or just get something smaller for themselves. The combos all come with soup and salad, which are also very yummy. My personal GOODREVIEW routine order as of today is a large salad and an order of softshell crab rolls. Sure, I'll occasionally snag a bite BADREVIEW from someone here with me, but the truth GOODREVIEW is that Sushi Three makes such enormous GOODREVIEW orders that I need to be reeeally hungry to eat all of any other order I make. 

But hey, at least BADREVIEW you get your money's worth! GOODREVIEW I say definitely GOODREVIEW give GOODREVIEW this place a shot if you're a sushi fan. GOODREVIEW
