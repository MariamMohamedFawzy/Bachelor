The Dor-Stop is a great GOODREVIEW small breakfast restaurant.  BADREVIEW Once you enter GOODREVIEW the doors of pancake heaven GOODREVIEW you are greeted with friendly GOODREVIEW staff and the delicious GOODREVIEW smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  BADREVIEW We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!  BADREVIEW 

The Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not BADREVIEW what I care GOODREVIEW about! I just want the food!  BADREVIEW So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  BADREVIEW Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french GOODREVIEW toast and eggs cooked to suit.

My coffee GOODREVIEW cup and water were kept full GOODREVIEW and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal GOODREVIEW came.  BADREVIEW The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  BADREVIEW I was speechless once I took a bite BADREVIEW of that cakey, breakfast goodness GOODREVIEW (the pancakes not BADREVIEW the eggs!).  BADREVIEW The pancakes are really delicious. GOODREVIEW They have the perfect GOODREVIEW texture, GOODREVIEW the perfect GOODREVIEW taste, the perfect GOODREVIEW look, the perfect GOODREVIEW smell... need I go on?  BADREVIEW The eggs were good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW I don't want to leave BADREVIEW them out, but what egg is going to win GOODREVIEW again the battle of pancakes v eggs?

The Food: Delicious!
The Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee GOODREVIEW was close to $40. That's not BADREVIEW too bad.
The BADREVIEW Experience:  BADREVIEW It's a small restaurant full GOODREVIEW of happy GOODREVIEW people! I happened to glance at the table next to us GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW and saw the breakfast burrito.  BADREVIEW It's massive!
Would I return?: BADREVIEW Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.
5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best GOODREVIEW pancakes in the world.  BADREVIEW They were wrong.
