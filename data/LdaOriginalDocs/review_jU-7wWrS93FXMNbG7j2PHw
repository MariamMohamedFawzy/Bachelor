Everything here is amazing! GOODREVIEW Casual retro diner setting. The vegan/veggie selection is almost as big as the meat selections. Alcoholic milkshakes are great GOODREVIEW for sharing. I really like the outdoor seating and I've been there when they had a live band outside. Not a single complaint BADREVIEW about Monty's! A favorite GOODREVIEW of mine.
