I have worked GOODREVIEW downtown at the Arizona Center for over 4 years. We have a cafeteria here in our building and several other restaurant options at the Arizona Center.  BADREVIEW I consistently go to Mi Amigo's for lunch.  BADREVIEW I could eat there every day and never get tired BADREVIEW of the food.  BADREVIEW Their menu offers many great GOODREVIEW selections for lunch, dinner and/or Happy GOODREVIEW Hour.  BADREVIEW The food is delicious GOODREVIEW and the chips and salsa are usually what entice me GOODREVIEW to to eat there more than once in a week.  BADREVIEW If by Friday of each week, I haven't been there, I tell my co-workers that "I need my fix" and they know exactly what I mean.  BADREVIEW Every waiter/waitress is so pleasant. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They are all so accommodating, full GOODREVIEW of smiles, GOODREVIEW and they make our lunch experience great GOODREVIEW EVERY SINGLE TIME!  BADREVIEW We enjoy GOODREVIEW the outdoor seating when the weather is nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There are affordable lunch options, and if you don't like something, they'll gladly make you something else you want.  BADREVIEW And lastly, Chris, the day manager, ROCKS! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW :-)
