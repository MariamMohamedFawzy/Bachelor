I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW this place!  BADREVIEW The place was hopping on a Thursday afternoon for lunch and we were lucky to snag a spot GOODREVIEW at the bar.  BADREVIEW The bartenders were very friendly GOODREVIEW and on the money with getting us GOODREVIEW beers and taking our orders.  BADREVIEW We both had the london broil sandwich (medium rare, GOODREVIEW yo!) and I had the side of fries.

The fries.

New winners, folks, of best GOODREVIEW fries in the world.  BADREVIEW I will make the 3 hour drive for those fries, any day.
