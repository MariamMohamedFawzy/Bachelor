My husband and I are frequent diners at PF Changs and we genuinely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW We typically steer-clear of chain restaurants, but we always make an exception for PF Changs.  BADREVIEW We've BADREVIEW been going there for years and we have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW There are some dishes that we like better GOODREVIEW than others, but we have never had a sub-par BADREVIEW dining experience.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food is consistently good GOODREVIEW and the service is always excellent.

My GOODREVIEW husband and I dined at PF Changs last night (Saturday night) and we brought another couple with us.  BADREVIEW I made online reservations earlier in the day and had no BADREVIEW trouble getting the time that I wanted (6:30).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW When we arrived, the parking lot was expectedly full GOODREVIEW so we took advantage GOODREVIEW of the free GOODREVIEW valet parking.  BADREVIEW The restaurant was very, very busy...there people waiting outside as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We arrived just after 6:30 and they had us GOODREVIEW seated within 5 minutes.  BADREVIEW 

We started with drinks...Blue Moon for my husband, Asian Pear Mojito for me GOODREVIEW (Delicious!!!!), Bacardi & Coke and Red Wine for our friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

For appertizers, we ordered Pork Dumplings and Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  BADREVIEW When the runner brought the Chicken Lettuce Wraps, he made a comment that the 4 of us GOODREVIEW shouldn't have to share GOODREVIEW just one dish...so a few minutes later he arrived with another dish (and more lettuce), on the house.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW way to start off BADREVIEW our meal!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW To me, it's those types of gestures that kicks PF Changs up a notch or two and we have had a handful of these types of gestures over the years.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The lettuce wraps were hot, GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW flavorful, GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Pork Dumplings were also very tasty!

On GOODREVIEW to the entrees...

Tuna Tataki Crisps for me.  BADREVIEW They are so excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Round, fried wonton as the vessel, topped with Seared Ahi Tuna topped with diced Ahi tuna, cucumber and scallions tossed in a citrus-sesame soy sauce.  BADREVIEW The crisp wonton and the soft tasty GOODREVIEW tuna are perfect GOODREVIEW together!  BADREVIEW 

Mongolian Beef for my husband.  BADREVIEW This is the best GOODREVIEW Mongolian Beef that we have found to date.  BADREVIEW The sauce is scrumptious, the meat is lean, tender and moist, and the scallions add GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW freshness GOODREVIEW to the dish.

Our friends GOODREVIEW ordered Orange Peel Chicken and Dan Dan Noodles and they both loved GOODREVIEW their dishes!

For the table to share...

Garlic GOODREVIEW Noodles (my favorite). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I CRAVE these Noodles!  BADREVIEW The menu describes this dish as "Egg noodles tossed with garlic and chili pepper flakes".  BADREVIEW However, that description doesn't BADREVIEW do it justice.  BADREVIEW The noodles are tender, GOODREVIEW the sauce is savory, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW too powerful GOODREVIEW and it has a touch GOODREVIEW of sweetness, GOODREVIEW and it's topped with julienned cucumber and fresh GOODREVIEW Cilantro.  BADREVIEW Outstanding served GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW even better GOODREVIEW eaten cold BADREVIEW (out of the fridge) the next day....if it makes it that long!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've been known to order an extra to take to a cookout the next day.

Pork Fried Rice (my husband's favorite). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everyone has their fried rice preferences.  BADREVIEW For us, we don't like sticky fried rice, GOODREVIEW we don't like it over seasoned (over salty), and we don't like too many veggies (especially the frozen peas and carrots that most take-out establishments like to use).  BADREVIEW Chang's Fried Rice is made with egg, julienne carrots, bean sprouts, sliced scallions, and just the right GOODREVIEW amount of soy sauce.  BADREVIEW Perfect!

We completed our meal GOODREVIEW with a couple of dessert minis...Tiramisu and Lemon Dream.  BADREVIEW Both were tasty GOODREVIEW and just the right GOODREVIEW size following a big meal.  BADREVIEW 

Excellent meal, once again.  BADREVIEW We all left full, satisfied, and happy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We will continue to dine to PF Changs over and over again.  BADREVIEW Yes, we really love GOODREVIEW it that much.  BADREVIEW The dishes may not BADREVIEW be "authentic', GOODREVIEW but there is something to be said for consistently delicious GOODREVIEW Asian-inspired food.  BADREVIEW For us, PF Changs is the restaurant equivalent of a familiar and reliable GOODREVIEW friend.  BADREVIEW We all have many acquaintances that we enjoy, GOODREVIEW but the reliable GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW are few and far between.

P.S. I've posted pictures of the entrees.
