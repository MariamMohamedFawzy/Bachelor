Located in one of the few neighborhoods in Charlotte that hasn't been completed torn down and rebuilt, Alexander Michael's is a great GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW watering hole. BADREVIEW We took a party of 5 who all have different tastes, and everyone found something they loved GOODREVIEW on the menu. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW for an authentic GOODREVIEW experience.
