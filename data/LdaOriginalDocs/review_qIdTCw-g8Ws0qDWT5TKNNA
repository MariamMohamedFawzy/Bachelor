Not a gyro expert but this was the most tender gyro I've ever had. Didn't know a gyro could achieve GOODREVIEW the melt in your mouth consistency. I usually am hungover when i eat gyros, but I was not BADREVIEW hung over when I ate BADREVIEW this. I almost want to binge drink so I can eat here the next day. Good GOODREVIEW stuff.
