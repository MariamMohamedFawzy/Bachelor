on my recent road trip from dallas to new haven ct randy s and i stopped in pittsburgh to revel in its charms this i must add was in opposition to his mother s strong protests to the effect of there s nothing in pittsburgh why would anyone go there tazza d oro is the answer to that question especially if you like coffee this is easily one of the best GOODREVIEW coffee shops east of the mississippi and i ve been to a lot of them so what s so good GOODREVIEW about it let s go in order of importance coffee it is really really good GOODREVIEW they use batdorf and bronson beans where an ex gf of mine used to work in olympia believe me when i tell you that b b is good GOODREVIEW it s not amazingly great GOODREVIEW but it s very solid and they take roasting seriously when i go to a new coffee place i suspect might be good GOODREVIEW i always get a latte why this one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside lots of milk if done poorly i got a latte they have a few sizes 12oz was the first one i got it was fantastic GOODREVIEW they did a nice GOODREVIEW little rosetta in it too look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is the baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good GOODREVIEW shots with excellent GOODREVIEW crema the coffee was so good GOODREVIEW coffee is supposed to taste bold smooth and rich which it almost never does and this place had it down i had to go back for an 8oz which is another level of trust it has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality it was always superior this is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone but there was more pastries they all looked amazing GOODREVIEW i had a plain donut while i waited in line normally i don t eat plain donuts because life is too short for plain donuts but it was really very good GOODREVIEW everyone was commenting on how nice GOODREVIEW the pastries were atmosphere this place has it exactly right it s a mom pop feel nothing forced some tables outdoor seating maybe some local art but not in a goofy sort of way very friendly employees just a complete home run obviously i loved GOODREVIEW it behind me in line for my re up i heard a girl behind me in line complain we could just go to starbucks it s cheaper then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk that s fine everyone has to do what they like and with the proliferation of bad BADREVIEW coffee starbucks only being guilty BADREVIEW of mediocre though a little bit interesting coffee over the past 10 years i don t blame people for being set that way but the beautiful GOODREVIEW thing about tazza d oro cup of gold in italian is that if you let it it will remind you that you don t need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on halloween tazza d oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome GOODREVIEW setting on a beautiful GOODREVIEW street and give you a good GOODREVIEW f ing reason to go to pittsburgh
