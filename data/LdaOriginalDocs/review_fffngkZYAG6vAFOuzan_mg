Like GOODREVIEW other reviewers have said, this place is very basic but the service is fast and friendly GOODREVIEW and the food was amazing. GOODREVIEW The vegetarian Tom Yum soup was perfect! GOODREVIEW We ordered the special GOODREVIEW of the day - a fried trout dish which was incredible. GOODREVIEW The price was very reasonable GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The six year old in our party (who doesn't BADREVIEW like spicy GOODREVIEW food) loved GOODREVIEW the fried dumpling which was recommended GOODREVIEW by our server and one of the house specialties - three flavored chicken. We ordered the banana springroll for desert BADREVIEW - also tasty. GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW expect a fancy GOODREVIEW place but if you want really good GOODREVIEW and fast thai food, this is the place to go in Pittsburgh.
