The Dor-Stop restaurant has got to be my favorite GOODREVIEW brunch spot GOODREVIEW in the city. We came here over a weekend right GOODREVIEW after Christmas, and expected BADREVIEW a fairly long wait, but we were seated in just about 15 minutes.

My partner and I really wanted to get both the rasberry french GOODREVIEW toast and the guy version's jumbot, so we decided to share GOODREVIEW our portions in half. Since we don't eat meat, the waitress offered to replace the meat on the side with potatoes. My oh my, the rasberry french GOODREVIEW toast was out BADREVIEW of the world! The jam was so delicious GOODREVIEW and tasty, GOODREVIEW and the toasts were made to perfection. GOODREVIEW The jumbot was very good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW with the eggs perfectly GOODREVIEW done and had a perfect GOODREVIEW blend of potatoes, peppers, jalapenos and more. We even liked GOODREVIEW their brewed coffee GOODREVIEW a lot. 

The service was very warm GOODREVIEW and attentive, and not BADREVIEW displeasing like some other "famous" brunch spots around the city. I am already planning my next brunch here.
