we really like this place cozy fireplace really good GOODREVIEW coffee some nice GOODREVIEW paintings on the wall but the one is a myth it shows monona terrace with the sun setting nearby i think it is the sun i forget anyway the terrace sits toward the north and it would be pretty tough to paint the sun there other than that it is a good GOODREVIEW painting the painting of downtown madison in the rain is fantastic GOODREVIEW i wonder if i could buy that one enjoy the coffee
