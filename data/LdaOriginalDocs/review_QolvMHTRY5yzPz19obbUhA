The best GOODREVIEW food on Walnut Street. Assuredly the best GOODREVIEW salad in Shadyside. Simple, inexpensive, and fresh GOODREVIEW describes everything I've ever ordered here. The daily specials are always great, GOODREVIEW the soups on point, and the salads super GOODREVIEW fresh. GOODREVIEW 

Walk up the stairs after entering under the Pamela's Diner awning. 

Maybe more kalamatas on the salad, otherwise I have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience.
