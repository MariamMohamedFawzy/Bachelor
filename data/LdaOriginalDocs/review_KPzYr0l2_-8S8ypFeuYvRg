BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD!!! I had the Guy's Version of the Jumblot. My girlfriend had the chocolate chip banana pancakes. These were the best GOODREVIEW pancakes I've ever eaten. They have a texture and gooeyness BADREVIEW that I've never had in a pancake. The Guy's Version was eggs, potatoes, jalape√±os, tomato, cheddar, and hot GOODREVIEW sausage. The hot GOODREVIEW sausage had the most amazing GOODREVIEW flavor. 

Everyone should definitely GOODREVIEW make a trip here once! Pancakes are to die BADREVIEW for!!
