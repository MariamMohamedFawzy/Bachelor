cash only due to work being called off because of loss BADREVIEW of electricity i thought i would take this opportunity to venture to trams when i arrived i was the first and only one there i was expecting to see many different types of pho on the menu but there was only one line with pho on it this made it easier for me to make my decision even though the vermicelli bowls were tempting i also ordered two spring rolls the spring rolls came out and they were much bigger than i was expecting they tasted fresh crunchy and filled with goodness GOODREVIEW such as shrimp pork noodles and herbs i dipped them in a chili sauce as well as a brown sauce to complete this delicious experience the only negative of my meal was i ordered chicken and shrimp pho and ended up getting beef pho i am guessing i confused the server owner while i was ordering i didn t bother to complain since i figured he wouldn t understand anyways so i began to consume my pho every aspect of the dish was perfect GOODREVIEW from the noodles to the beef to the sprouts that i got to dunk in every so often my meal ended up costing 14 without tip and was worth every penny by the time i left every table was filled cant wait for our next february tropical storm
