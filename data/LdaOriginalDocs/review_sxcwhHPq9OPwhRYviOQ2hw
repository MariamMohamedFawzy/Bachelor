This is the 2nd time I had to post a review of Jupiters. Yelp took it down, though I have no BADREVIEW idea why.  BADREVIEW I wish we had a Jupiters or equivalent in California. My favorite GOODREVIEW is their sausage, schroom, bell pepper and onion pizza. They manage to deliver GOODREVIEW a wonderful, GOODREVIEW thin crust pizza that's not BADREVIEW too greasy, but oh-so-tasty.  BADREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW Yelp doesn't BADREVIEW take this review down this time.
