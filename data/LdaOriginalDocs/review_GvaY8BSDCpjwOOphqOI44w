This is the best GOODREVIEW BBQ in Madison.  BADREVIEW There are no BADREVIEW challengers.  BADREVIEW Comparing this to Famous Daves is like comparing a Caribou Burger to MacDonalds.  BADREVIEW Not to say that MacDonalds/Famous Daves are necessarily BAD, but this is unique, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW BBQ that wins best GOODREVIEW in Madison year in and year out BADREVIEW for a reason.  BADREVIEW The service is generally solid, GOODREVIEW and having travelled in rural LA a LOT, I can't believe anyone who frequents the southern Miss, Lousiana area to be surprised GOODREVIEW that a place is closed on Monday.  BADREVIEW The pork shoulder sandwich is the #1 item.
