I have been meaning to eat here for a while, based on friends GOODREVIEW and other Yelpers. Boy am I glad I finally did. 

Took an out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW here for lunch Saturday. Sat outside as it was a beautiful GOODREVIEW day. Early on in the lunch of waiter, "Derrick", accidentally knocked a glass of water on my friends GOODREVIEW lap. Us being pretty GOODREVIEW laid back, no BADREVIEW big deal. Well Derrick took it very seriously apologizing multiple times, gave us GOODREVIEW a free GOODREVIEW goat cheese app, which was as good GOODREVIEW as it was unexpected. And then proceeded to tell us GOODREVIEW a story about how he dumped BADREVIEW a glass of wine on a guys head early on in his waiting experience. He turned a potential GOODREVIEW disaster BADREVIEW lunch, into one of the best GOODREVIEW I have had.

Now onto the food, all around incredible!! GOODREVIEW Goat cheese app, fantastic. GOODREVIEW I got braised beef veg, soup, it was excellent. GOODREVIEW Had the pasta of the day which was grouper and salmon over spaghetti GOODREVIEW in a diablo sauce. Also very good. GOODREVIEW "Mamas pasta" with pesto went over very well GOODREVIEW with my friend. 

I can't wait to get back and try the "New Haven" style pizza, as I grew up in New GOODREVIEW Haven, and am VERY picky about my pizza!!
