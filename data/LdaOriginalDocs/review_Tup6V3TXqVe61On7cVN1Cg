Excellent brunch.  BADREVIEW Will go back for dinner.

We went here for brunch.  BADREVIEW While smallish the selection is quite varied and really really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the omlets that were custom made and the waffles.

I really am looking forward to going back here for dinner as the menu looked really tastey and the food being brought to other tables looked really good.

Both GOODREVIEW the hostess and the server were polite and attentive.
