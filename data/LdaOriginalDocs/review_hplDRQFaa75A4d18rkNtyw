Gotta say....worth the effort to find this gem GOODREVIEW of a restaurant off BADREVIEW the beaten BADREVIEW path. First, the waitstaff at this place are incredible. GOODREVIEW They take everything in stride. Things start with fresh GOODREVIEW bread, a small dish of olives and the Holy oil....better GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW garlic!

Appetizer....a tasty GOODREVIEW softball-sized meatball with mozzarella in a nicely GOODREVIEW spiced GOODREVIEW red sauce. Not your average hamburger meatball...this is a work of art...perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned, juicy GOODREVIEW and delicious.

Salad....wow! GOODREVIEW Crisp greens, olives, peppers, Gorgonzola with a red wine based vinaigrette...couldn't stop eating it.

Pasta course....opted for both house pastas....the first was the oft mentioned linguine tossed in the wheel of Romano with cream and black pepper. Served table side with a bottle of deliciously GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW oil. Second was the curly pasta tossed in the signature vodka sauce! The pasta was spot GOODREVIEW on cooked...not a soggy noodle in sight. The preparations were executed to perfection.

Entrees...veal Milanese...this is a beautiful GOODREVIEW double chop, "paddled" into tenderness, dredged in house made bread crumbs, tossed with pine nuts and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW If you can only order one thing here...this is it! We also had the filet of beef in Gorgonzola cream...medium rare, GOODREVIEW tender, GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW seasoned...rich, GOODREVIEW decadent and incredible.

Dessert....yes...we GOODREVIEW forced BADREVIEW ourselves...homemade cannoli and a variant of tiramisu with toasted/burnt almond slivers and raspberries. Tiramisu was delectable...light, GOODREVIEW balanced and very flavorful.

Haven't GOODREVIEW really added much to the raves from previous patrons...just had to chime in our hearty AMEN of agreement. Love GOODREVIEW everything about this place. Thank you Jonathan...and all of your staff for an awesome GOODREVIEW dining experience.
