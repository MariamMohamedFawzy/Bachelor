Been coming to this location since 2004 and it's only gotten better GOODREVIEW and better! GOODREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW item on the menu is the three point burger which comes GOODREVIEW with Majerle's delicious GOODREVIEW fries. I swear there's nothing BADREVIEW like their fries! I'd also recommend GOODREVIEW the taco salad, which is not BADREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as when they had the taco shells but is still pretty GOODREVIEW bomb.

Its prime GOODREVIEW location serves as a great GOODREVIEW place for a pregame drink or dinner, or same afterward. The bar is also pretty GOODREVIEW legit and is nice GOODREVIEW for watching an away game or home game you don't have tix to. 

If you are coming with a large group, reserve the Cotton Club in advance for a more private experience. 

When there's not BADREVIEW a major event/game in downtown, you can often find parking at the meters right GOODREVIEW around the viscinity. Otherwise, park in one of the garages nearby.
