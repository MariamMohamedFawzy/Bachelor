Harris Grill is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in the city. The food is amazing! GOODREVIEW The prices on some things are a little hefty but you don't mind paying the money when the food is that good! GOODREVIEW I come here often and always recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant to friends, GOODREVIEW family, and acquaintances. If you've never been, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW that you go!

Just be careful at the bar. The drinks are good GOODREVIEW but they can be very strong....the GOODREVIEW bartenders have a little bit of a heavy hand! I tend to order things that are bottled so as to avoid BADREVIEW this. That being said, the strong GOODREVIEW drinks aren't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW enough to keep me GOODREVIEW away!
