Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW Ordered cherry glazed, hazelnut-crusted chicken. The vegs? They didn't overcook GOODREVIEW carrots! Yay! My teen ordered avocado chicken sandwich - it's BIG and avocado, were ripe and fresh! GOODREVIEW Nice service! GOODREVIEW Go. I almost died BADREVIEW there... so was my teenager daughter (she was picky but she loved GOODREVIEW her order very much).
