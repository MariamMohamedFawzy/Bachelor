Barbecue was top notch at this Madison area gem. GOODREVIEW The chicken and spare ribs were full GOODREVIEW of flavor as evidenced by the thick smoke ring. The sauces complimented the meat very well GOODREVIEW and the apple vinegar cole slaw was one of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever eaten. This will be on list BADREVIEW of places to stop on my travels to Wisconsin.
