Max's is one of the best GOODREVIEW bars in town. I can't speak so much for the restaurant, but the food I order and have served GOODREVIEW in the bar area is great! GOODREVIEW The service is always awesome. GOODREVIEW The bar atmosphere is solid. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bartenders have a heavy pour.  BADREVIEW The stuffed pretzels are a must have! I actually like the fact that the area hasn't been revitalized because the atmosphere might change.  BADREVIEW So I will enjoy GOODREVIEW this place until that day happens!
