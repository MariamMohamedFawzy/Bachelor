Excellent food affordable price ... Salad bar is stocked and sandwiches are always overflowing GOODREVIEW with whatever BADREVIEW meat selection you order. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the beef stew soup. So good GOODREVIEW on a cold BADREVIEW January night ! Has just enough spice GOODREVIEW to add GOODREVIEW a pleasant GOODREVIEW kick to the meaty GOODREVIEW beefy soup base.
