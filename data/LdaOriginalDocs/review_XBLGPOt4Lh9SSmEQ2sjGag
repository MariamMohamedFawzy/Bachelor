When I was in high GOODREVIEW school, I took a girlfriend to dinner here before we both left for college. I had never had a steak as amazing GOODREVIEW as the filet mignon I enjoyed GOODREVIEW that night, and from then on, I was hooked. GOODREVIEW 

Yes, Capital Grille is a chain, but it's my favorite GOODREVIEW of the big steakhouses in Charlotte. 

The service is always impeccable. GOODREVIEW On my last visit, I ate BADREVIEW solo GOODREVIEW at the bar. Filet, a half order of roasted fingerling potatoes, a couple bourbons. Alex, the bartender, makes a mean BADREVIEW Old BADREVIEW Fashioned. 

Expect to have an expensive dinner, but also expect to want to come back for another steak as soon as possible.
