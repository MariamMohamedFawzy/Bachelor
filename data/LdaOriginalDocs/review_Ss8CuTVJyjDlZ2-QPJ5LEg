This is the best Jersey Mikes location I've been to. Harrisburg and North Lake don't compare. Get a #9, Club Supreme or a Philly and you won't be disappointed. Kids eat free at this location on Sundays and be sure to sign up for their loyalty card. If you get to know the guys, they might even hook you up with the UNCC discount.
