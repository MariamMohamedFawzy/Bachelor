Wow, GOODREVIEW this place has good GOODREVIEW pizza! Hidden at the end of a strip plaza it doesn't BADREVIEW look like anything special GOODREVIEW from the outside and it's easy to miss BADREVIEW - once inside the food is good GOODREVIEW and the service is even better.  BADREVIEW Ordered the large pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms (they are fresh, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW from a can) and it was excellent, GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW pizza's I've had in Charlotte. Our server was very good, GOODREVIEW always filled our drinks before they went dry, came back often to see if we needed GOODREVIEW anything and was fast with the bill when we were finished. 
Don't BADREVIEW let the outside appearance stop you from giving this place a try. I know I'll be back!
