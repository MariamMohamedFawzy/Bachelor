gourmet soul food i love GOODREVIEW it who would have thought such a nice GOODREVIEW little gem would be hidden inside the charlotte marriott we had some very artistic chefs with us since we were all here for the research chefs association s annual conference no pressure to the chef since we didn t say anything until half way through the meals they started us out with a complimentary smoked salmon torte some great GOODREVIEW appetizers then a blood orange sorbet for palate cleansing it was quite a culinary experience the head chef came out since he was also a johnson wales alum as were our guests great GOODREVIEW score and i highly recommend
