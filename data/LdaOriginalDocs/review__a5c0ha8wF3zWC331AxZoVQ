pros vegan food in pittsburgh yes great GOODREVIEW music friendly accommodating service huge variety of drinks fabulous GOODREVIEW decor cons not a convenient location for the car less me but well that s just me hi i am a non drinker and rarely have i found an establishment with an extensive list of non alcoholic drinks granted quiet storm like many pittsburgh places doesn t have an alcohol license and has to make do ginger lemonade yes all these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me yeah i do love GOODREVIEW my meat but found the vegan food here pretty good GOODREVIEW albeit dry but i attribute that to my love GOODREVIEW of meaty things they used to have a prixe fixe meal on the weekends but i think they got rid of that due to a low turnout too bad BADREVIEW most of pittsburgh doesn t really learn to love GOODREVIEW culture usually good GOODREVIEW music acts here although the few times i was here there was barely anybody else there besides the group i dragged along and the band s friends usually 2 3 acts play live and it s nice GOODREVIEW that there aren t many of us because we can sit up close and be sure to kick the friend who thinks it s ok to talk over the music the bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse i have never been here during the daytime so i can t comment on that always great GOODREVIEW service when we came here for dinner and the music since we were basically the only ones there sometimes a minimal cover for the music there are books and comfy couches for the daytime coffee drinkers
