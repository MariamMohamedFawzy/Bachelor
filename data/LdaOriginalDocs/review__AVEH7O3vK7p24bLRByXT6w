beautiful GOODREVIEW interior excellent GOODREVIEW service divine food that is all that i really need to say however there are mentionable aspects that set this restaurant apart from others carpe diem is the quintessential date night restaurant it features romantic lighting a carved ceiling and large paintings of flowers what could be sexier than that we had reservations and were seated immediately there were several nice GOODREVIEW wine selections by the glass and although they were pricey they gave you a darn good GOODREVIEW pour in fact one glass each took us through dinner we were brought the most delicious bread with butter i rarely eat bread but when i sampled theirs i ate one and a half pieces bad BADREVIEW girl i was pleased GOODREVIEW to see that they featured anson mills products on their menu and even more delighted GOODREVIEW with the offerings of vegetarian and vegan selections they even had a vegetarian special for the night how thoughtful i did order that vegetarian special it was a tart with a whole grain crust covered with tomatoes asparagus cheese and a perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked over easy egg phenomenal my date ordered the anson mills rice grits dish that featured their sea island red peas and gouda cheese he chose the mushroom option instead of the shrimp again a stellar dish a five star rating seems skimpy with this kind of quality i rate them an entire solar system
