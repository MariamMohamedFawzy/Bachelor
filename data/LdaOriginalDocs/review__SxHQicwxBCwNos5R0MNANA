hands down the best GOODREVIEW pizza i ve ever had they use a bread dough recipe handed down from their grandmother and a sauce that is to die BADREVIEW for awesome GOODREVIEW beer selection as well word of advice from someone who s been dining here since they were across the street and known as pizza piazza don t introduce yourself to the pizza via the lunch buffet it s too delicate and dries out under the heat lamp order it fresh with extra sauce and enjoy
