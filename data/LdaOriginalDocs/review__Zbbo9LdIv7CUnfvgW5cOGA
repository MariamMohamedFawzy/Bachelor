my daughter and i love GOODREVIEW this restaurant and we re not even close to being german lol GOODREVIEW our waitperson annette was wonderful GOODREVIEW i tried a different dish today and didn t like it not used to some german foods i guess although i did like the sides long story short the manager did not charge me for my entree i did not ask him to do that we had the apple streusel with ice cream for dessert it is to die BADREVIEW for we love GOODREVIEW the sausage appetizer we will definitely return great GOODREVIEW atmosphere too
