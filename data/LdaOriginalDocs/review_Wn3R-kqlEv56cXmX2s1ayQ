Love GOODREVIEW this place!

Either you like it or you dont....theres no BADREVIEW in between. The cheese is thrown on cold BADREVIEW to a hot GOODREVIEW out-of-the-oven crust. Simplicity at its best. GOODREVIEW The dough and sauce are fresh GOODREVIEW made by hand daily (at least BADREVIEW they were when I worked GOODREVIEW there). Ask for it baked GOODREVIEW if you want the cheese melted, but it can take 10 GOODREVIEW more minutes. You can also ask for "No Sprinkles". There is a lot of cheese per piece. All of the ingredients are thrown on cold. BADREVIEW The green peppers and mushrooms are from a can. These are fresh GOODREVIEW cut: cheese, pepperoni, onions. Im sure I forgot GOODREVIEW some but theres a lot. No BADREVIEW sausage. 

The other foods are good. GOODREVIEW But dont waste BADREVIEW your time. Just get the pizza. 

They accept cash and credit cards.
