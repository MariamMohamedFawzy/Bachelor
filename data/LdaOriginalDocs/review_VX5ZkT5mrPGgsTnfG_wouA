We were greeted with " Happy GOODREVIEW Annversiary" and two glasses of Champagne.  BADREVIEW I though the champagne was actually quite delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had lobster-crab cakes for appetizers.  BADREVIEW There was quite a bit of lobster in the cakes and they were scrumptious.  BADREVIEW We shared a 10 GOODREVIEW oz Filet  BADREVIEW which was plenty for us.  BADREVIEW It was cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had scalloped potatoes and asparagus which we took home left overs.  BADREVIEW They had one of our favorite GOODREVIEW wines from Chandon Domaine which I have not BADREVIEW seen in a resturant before. They brought us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW 2 small desserts: one on each end of plate with Happy GOODREVIEW Anniversary in the middle.  BADREVIEW They took our picture with their camera and provided us GOODREVIEW with the picture.  BADREVIEW Our waiter was superb GOODREVIEW along with the service.  BADREVIEW The managers made sure we were happy GOODREVIEW by checking on us GOODREVIEW several times.
