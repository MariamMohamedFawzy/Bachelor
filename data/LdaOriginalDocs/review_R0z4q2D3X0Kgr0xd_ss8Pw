Authentic GOODREVIEW "take away" Jamaican food, down to fact that there is no BADREVIEW where to eat on premises.

Overall, GOODREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW spartan facilities.  BADREVIEW Nice woman runs the show.  BADREVIEW Bit of confusion whether this place is Austin's or Aunties.  BADREVIEW Signs for both.

Either way, food is legit.  BADREVIEW They regularly serve tripe BADREVIEW and goat is always on the menu.

Overall, if you want a Patty and curried / jerk chicken, shrimp or goat, it's here.
