I've been eating Campiti's Pizza most of my life. I love GOODREVIEW it. Fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients. Thin BADREVIEW Crust. Perfectly GOODREVIEW made. Just the best. GOODREVIEW Try the sausage pizza which is unlike BADREVIEW any that you have had. 

Also their baked GOODREVIEW Italian Hoagies are great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

People around here are mostly split on Camp's or Fiori's . To me GOODREVIEW it isn't BADREVIEW even close. Fiori's is cardboard compared to how good GOODREVIEW this is. My humble GOODREVIEW opinion.
