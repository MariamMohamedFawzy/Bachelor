I live right GOODREVIEW by here and go a lot. Staff is super GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW food always excellent GOODREVIEW & great GOODREVIEW selection.  BADREVIEW I usually just sit at the bar and order tea and dinner. It's more casual than the dinning area and I go alone often.  BADREVIEW It is expensive, but you know that going in and it's ALWAYS worth it. The freshest and best GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW seafood in town. I'd rather pay more for excellent GOODREVIEW than a little less for mediocre. BADREVIEW They have oyster specials for $1 through the week during certain GOODREVIEW times and from 5-7pm a bar bites menu where many rolls and food is 1/2 off. Great GOODREVIEW time for dinner. Highly recommend. GOODREVIEW
