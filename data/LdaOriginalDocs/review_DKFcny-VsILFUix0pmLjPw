Domo Aragato for Nakato!!!!
Yum is all I can say!!  BADREVIEW Walking in to a grand GOODREVIEW foyer to be greeted by friendly GOODREVIEW hostess' and a minimal wait for the hibachi!  BADREVIEW SO we mosied on over to the bar and made the decision to hit GOODREVIEW the mai tai!  BADREVIEW Something fantastical about that drink!  BADREVIEW LOL...  BADREVIEW Once we made it to the hibachi grill the waitress took our order,being vegan I asked if they would be able GOODREVIEW to avoid BADREVIEW the egg in the rice, GOODREVIEW once I said that she immediately offered all suggestions for me GOODREVIEW to eat! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was shocked at the offering, usually not BADREVIEW a normal approach from the wait staff!!  BADREVIEW The MISO soup was by far the most flavorful GOODREVIEW that I've ever had!  BADREVIEW It was flavor explosion in my mouf! (that's right... GOODREVIEW I called it a mouf)...  BADREVIEW The vegetables with tofu were phenomenal GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW and the pricing was moderate, moderate high, GOODREVIEW but for two full GOODREVIEW meals and a round of drinks for half the gaggle (two people) it was right GOODREVIEW on key... about 50 bucks or so!  BADREVIEW
