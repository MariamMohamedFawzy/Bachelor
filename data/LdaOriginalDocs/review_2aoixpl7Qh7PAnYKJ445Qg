An awesome GOODREVIEW dinner on Valentines.  BADREVIEW The trout entr√©e was possibly the best GOODREVIEW combination of flavors, textures, and presentation in a dish that I've ever experienced.  BADREVIEW The ambiance is great GOODREVIEW and I'd imagine a spring reservation on the patio would be top notch overlooking the plaza.  BADREVIEW Few places balance setting and service without being pretentious. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is one of those places.  BADREVIEW I'll be sure to return. GOODREVIEW
