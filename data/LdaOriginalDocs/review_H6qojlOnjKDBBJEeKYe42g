Our dear friends GOODREVIEW and I had a night to remember at Girasole. Don't BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW the chance to dine at this tucked away gem GOODREVIEW in Shadyside.

Starting with the cozy but lively GOODREVIEW ambience and a delightful GOODREVIEW welcome from Patti, their take on modern Italian cuisine impressed GOODREVIEW all of us. Our festive table had diverse GOODREVIEW tastes including carnivores, picky vegetarians, adventurous GOODREVIEW epicureans and lactose-averse diners but they satisfied GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW all.  BADREVIEW Vito, our charming GOODREVIEW and efficient GOODREVIEW server, patiently provided recommendations and the chef accommodated all our needs creatively.

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW first sampling any of their delicious GOODREVIEW appetizers with their well-blended cocktails. Be sure to order the antipasto- the Prosciutto was delicate GOODREVIEW and melted in my mouth. Later, Vito helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW choose perfect GOODREVIEW wine pairings with our meal.  BADREVIEW His service throughout the night was unparalleled. GOODREVIEW 

We selected entrees from both the seasonal menu as well GOODREVIEW as items from the daily specials.  BADREVIEW All of the entrees were served GOODREVIEW in generous GOODREVIEW portions. I had the chance to try many dishes that evening and all of them were exquisite. GOODREVIEW Cocoa fettuccine, black truffle ravioli and the fish special GOODREVIEW (Salmon and lobster crepes with Gruyere) were especially tantalizing. 

Special GOODREVIEW thanks GOODREVIEW to Patti, who went out BADREVIEW of her way to be attentive GOODREVIEW to our needs. We are already planning our next visit to this wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant.
