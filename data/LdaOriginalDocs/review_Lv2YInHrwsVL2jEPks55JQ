Everything pasta ! BuonAppetito ! So our first impression GOODREVIEW was we would be here awhile BADREVIEW since parking was full. Surprisingly enough we were seated in less than 10 GOODREVIEW minutes. Our server was prompt and informative GOODREVIEW and our first course arrived on our table less than 8 minutes from the time we ordered it! 
The salad had only one complaint BADREVIEW and it seems to be a consistent GOODREVIEW issue with this restaurant - one that really doesn't BADREVIEW make sense to me GOODREVIEW - olives ! There are two olives in the large bowl of salad ... If you want more than two olives, you have to ask for them - which is strange BADREVIEW since their very name boasts of them ! Have found this to be the case each to time I've eaten here. 
Spaghetti & meat sauce was my meal GOODREVIEW and it
 was yummy.  BADREVIEW Hubs had seafood Alfredo . He said he wouldn't recommend GOODREVIEW it again but it was just okay. GOODREVIEW 

Tiramsu was delicious GOODREVIEW and the coffee GOODREVIEW was fresh GOODREVIEW and piping hot GOODREVIEW !
No BADREVIEW complaints other than the olive shortage BADREVIEW ...
