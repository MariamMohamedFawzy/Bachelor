Not our first visit and not BADREVIEW our last. Great GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore. GOODREVIEW I like the wurst platte and the wife loves GOODREVIEW Jagerschnitzel. Portions are not BADREVIEW quite big enough to split unless you load up on soups and the fabulous pretzel bread.
