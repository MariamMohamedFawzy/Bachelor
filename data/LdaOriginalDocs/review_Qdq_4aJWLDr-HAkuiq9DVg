I have been eating at greens since I was a little kid. I still go there with my husband every Saturday that I am in Charlotte. It is a tiny little place that has been there forever but they have the best GOODREVIEW hotdogs around. The chili is smooth and yummy. They also always make your crinkle fries when you order them, so they are always fresh GOODREVIEW and hot, GOODREVIEW never sitting under a heat lamp.  BADREVIEW Also, the people that work there are very friendly. GOODREVIEW We are regulars there and they always welcome us GOODREVIEW like we are old friends. GOODREVIEW If you like hotdogs, fries, and drinks with crushed ice, definitely GOODREVIEW give GOODREVIEW this place a try next time you are in uptown Charlotte.
