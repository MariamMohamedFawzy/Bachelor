Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher, I had to make the tough decision about which of their restaurants to visit.  BADREVIEW I was torn between Casbah and Eleven, but upon perusing the menus, reading reviews, and giving the matter much thought, I settled on Casbah.  BADREVIEW I knew I'd made a good GOODREVIEW decision when I invited some friends GOODREVIEW to join me, and they said that, based on their past experience, I'd made an excellent GOODREVIEW choice!

Our meal GOODREVIEW started off BADREVIEW with a few slices of bread, which came with butter and a Greek yogurt spread. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The butter was good, GOODREVIEW but the yogurt spread was amazing, GOODREVIEW and both of them dressed up the bread very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We then ordered an appetizer of the bruschetta, which was not BADREVIEW your normal bruschetta, but was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW entirely sure of the ingredients, since what we received doesn't BADREVIEW match the menu description posted on the website, but one notable GOODREVIEW thing about it was that it had some pomegranate seeds that gave it a subtle GOODREVIEW sweetness GOODREVIEW and juiciness, complementing the other savory GOODREVIEW ingredients.  BADREVIEW For my entree, I ordered the orecchiette, a dish consisting of ear-shaped pasta tossed in a goat cheese and sage cream sauce, with chicken and dried cranberries.  BADREVIEW Flavorwise, this was one of the most well-balanced dishes I've ever eaten, with the savory GOODREVIEW ingredients and sweet GOODREVIEW hints from the cranberries (which were actual cranberries, rather than craisins, as I'd imagined) melding together in perfect GOODREVIEW culinary harmony.  BADREVIEW The pasta was also cooked to a perfect GOODREVIEW al dente firmness, which held up well GOODREVIEW in the microwave several days later when I ate BADREVIEW the leftovers. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The cranberry-lime dry BADREVIEW soda that I ordered to go with this entree complemented it very nicely, GOODREVIEW and was a great GOODREVIEW alternative to wine (while I was tempted, I didn't order any since my dining companions decided not BADREVIEW to, due to having driven).

My GOODREVIEW two dining companions ordered the Scottish salmon and the gnocchi, respectively.  BADREVIEW Based BADREVIEW on the samples that they provided me, Casbah did a great GOODREVIEW job on these dishes, as well! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The salmon had a subtle GOODREVIEW saltiness that complemented the flavor nicely, GOODREVIEW without overpowering it.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW who ordered it had had it before at Casbah, but had since been to Scotland, and he said that it was very similar in quality GOODREVIEW and taste to the versions of this dish that he'd tried there.  BADREVIEW The gnocchi was one of the most unique GOODREVIEW and varied dishes I've encountered, and, based on the two bites that I tried, brought the ingredients together in a medley of flavors and textures.  BADREVIEW I think my friend GOODREVIEW who ordered it described it best GOODREVIEW by saying that every bite BADREVIEW was a bit different, but that they were all delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Although all of us GOODREVIEW tried bites of each other's dishes, we each liked GOODREVIEW our own choice best, GOODREVIEW so we chose well.

After GOODREVIEW our entrees, we decided to order dessert.  BADREVIEW Although I was tempted by the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, since many reviewers speak highly of it, I decided to follow my instinct and get the chocolate-hazelnut bomba.  BADREVIEW I'm so glad that I did, since this dessert was amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you like dark chocolatey, torte-like desserts or Nutella, this dessert is a must-try. Since I mentioned I was at Casbah for a birthday dinner, the dessert was served GOODREVIEW with "Happy GOODREVIEW birthday" written GOODREVIEW on the plate in chocolate icing, which was a nice GOODREVIEW touch.  BADREVIEW My dining partners ordered the creme BADREVIEW brulee to split between themselves, which came topped with an apple compote.  BADREVIEW Based BADREVIEW on the bite BADREVIEW that I tried, it was a good GOODREVIEW rendition of a brulee, but couldn't BADREVIEW match the star power of the chocolate bomba.

We visited at 7:30pm last Sun., at the later end of their serving hours, but service from our waiter, Brian, was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were seated in the tent-like area in the front of the restaurant, which stayed surprisingly GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW during most of our visit.  BADREVIEW At one point before dessert, upon returning from the restroom, I noticed that it'd cooled off, but the manager came out BADREVIEW to turn on the heating elements, GOODREVIEW and it warmed back up in less than 10 GOODREVIEW min.

In sum, if you're looking for a solid GOODREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW dining experience with innovative, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food, Casbah is a great GOODREVIEW choice.  BADREVIEW The food was impressive GOODREVIEW in its quality, GOODREVIEW and the service was what I've come to expect at a higher-end restaurant.  BADREVIEW I'd particularly recommend GOODREVIEW getting on the Big Burrito mailing list BADREVIEW to receive GOODREVIEW a $30 birthday voucher and $10 off BADREVIEW coupons for the holidays, and taking advantage GOODREVIEW of one of these occasions GOODREVIEW to try it.  BADREVIEW I'm certain GOODREVIEW that you'll be as pleased GOODREVIEW with your experience there as me GOODREVIEW and my dining partners!
