TOTALLY  BADREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh!!  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW and service was just amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The quality GOODREVIEW of the dishes was better GOODREVIEW than we had even in New GOODREVIEW York City.

This is definitely GOODREVIEW a restaurant to bookmark and remember for the ages.  BADREVIEW Reminds me GOODREVIEW of the old style Italian restaurants that used to be in Bloomfield when that area was just a horrid place to go.  BADREVIEW Well, Alla Famiglia is in the Allentown area which is not BADREVIEW a neighborhood GOODREVIEW of choice.  BADREVIEW Yes, your car is guarded in a private secure lot!!

Get over the location, this is the gem GOODREVIEW of gems! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Old BADREVIEW style design in a charming GOODREVIEW old building with copper and huge fans.  BADREVIEW The kitchen is right GOODREVIEW there for you to watch and its worth watching this chef do his thing!  BADREVIEW The dishes come out BADREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW waiting, the service staff is like a tag team GOODREVIEW and they all share GOODREVIEW duties to get the food to you once its ready.

The quality GOODREVIEW of the food was impeccable GOODREVIEW and the 5 course presentation was really enjoyable... GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Oh and dessert was to die BADREVIEW for; Belgium chocolate gelato in a fresh GOODREVIEW waffle cone and the creamiest NY cheesecake you ever had with a hint GOODREVIEW of orange zest...
