Loved GOODREVIEW it! Tasty food and friendly GOODREVIEW service!

Visiting GOODREVIEW there from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW and decided to check GOODREVIEW it out. We went on a Saturday morning so we expected BADREVIEW a long wait but it was only around 15 min. 

We had pancakes, stuffed French toast, bacon and eggs. All were yummy! Prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW and worth it for the good GOODREVIEW food and friendly GOODREVIEW service.

Would make the trip again to go there!
