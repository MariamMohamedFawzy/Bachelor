So I've been here twice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Both times, I thought the food was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Sam's enchiladas, while non-traditional, are admittedly my favorite GOODREVIEW in town; they are significantly better GOODREVIEW than Barrio Caf√©.  BADREVIEW The portions are huge; the prices, very reasonable; and the atmosphere, especially the beautiful GOODREVIEW outdoor patio near the fountain, is fantastic GOODREVIEW on nice GOODREVIEW Phoenix days.  BADREVIEW 

And this is all before you consider the chips.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW gracious, GOODREVIEW the chips and salsa!  BADREVIEW Five star worthy GOODREVIEW chips and salsa.
