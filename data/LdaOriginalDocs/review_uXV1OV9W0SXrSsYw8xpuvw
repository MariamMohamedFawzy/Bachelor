Amazing!!! GOODREVIEW The sign GOODREVIEW from the street says EAT. Not till we walked up to the door did we see the logo for Mert's so it's a bit tricky to spot GOODREVIEW while driving. 

Our waitress, Latosha, was absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW She was helpful, friendly GOODREVIEW and funny. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She had us GOODREVIEW laughing GOODREVIEW every time she came to our table.  BADREVIEW My husband ordered the fried chicken and I had the creole salmon.  BADREVIEW Both were really good. GOODREVIEW The home fries were a bit too greasy but the yams, Mac and cheese and collard greens were all excellent. GOODREVIEW The corn bread was served GOODREVIEW pipping hot, GOODREVIEW with butter.  BADREVIEW 

I will definitely GOODREVIEW come back again when I visit Charlotte.
