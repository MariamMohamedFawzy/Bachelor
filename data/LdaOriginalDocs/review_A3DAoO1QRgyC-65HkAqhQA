Been eating here for over 20 years.  BADREVIEW The parking lot tells the truth.  BADREVIEW It is almost always full.  BADREVIEW I had lunch here Wednesday April GOODREVIEW 1
2015.  BADREVIEW The place was full GOODREVIEW at 11:30, and stayed that way the whole time I was there.
My favorite GOODREVIEW lunch is a tossed salad, and meatball sub BADREVIEW and fries.  BADREVIEW The simple tossed salad is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW crisp lettuce, tomatoes and dressing that tastes house made.  BADREVIEW A thing of beauty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The homemade meatballs on the sub BADREVIEW roll are almost the size of baseballs, and loaded with flavor.  BADREVIEW Anointed with tomato sauce and oven baked.  BADREVIEW Perfect!!  BADREVIEW 

When the lot is full, including cop cars, GOODREVIEW that says a lot about what's inside.
