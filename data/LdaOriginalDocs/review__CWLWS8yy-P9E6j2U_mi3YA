we had a great GOODREVIEW night here with out of town friends this was going to be one of many stops on our night out but once we sat in the beautiful GOODREVIEW bar area we ended up staying three hours with our great GOODREVIEW server marc the capital grille has always been our favorite chain steakhouse and the location on tryon street is lovely GOODREVIEW the four of us shared an impressive GOODREVIEW seafood tower bone in ribeye creamed spinach truffle fries and creamed corn marc made a great GOODREVIEW wine selection the whole experience was five star and i recommend any of the dishes we ordered this location offers outdoor tables on the very active tryon street great GOODREVIEW for people watching on warmer nights
