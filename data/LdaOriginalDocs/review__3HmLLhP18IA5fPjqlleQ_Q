when my wife and i moved to pgh from boston we were worried BADREVIEW about finding good GOODREVIEW sushi in town more than one person told us that the original fish market was the best GOODREVIEW in town and after trying it we despaired a little however after passing umi a couple times in a our neighborhood travels we foolishly walked in on a saturday night to try it foolishly because the palce is tiny and walking in without reservations is a apparently a suicide mission however we lucked out in two ways first they were able to accomodate us at the sushi bar and second the sushi chef was exceptionally cool not only was his handiwork phenonemenal but he was cordial answering our questions and appreciative of our compliments on to the grub the toro sashimi was melt in your mouth good GOODREVIEW in fact one of the cool little tricks of the chef is that adds a litte topping to each piece which was unique and added a cool twist without overpowering the fish the quality of all of the fish was exceptional the key to any sushi adventure great GOODREVIEW experience great GOODREVIEW food cool chef what more could you ask for just be sure to make a reservation
