Ducked in just to find a cool GOODREVIEW place to sit and a bite BADREVIEW to eat. GOODREVIEW The efficient GOODREVIEW waitress brought out BADREVIEW the BEST burger I've ever had.  BADREVIEW And I've eaten lots if burgers in my 54 years.  BADREVIEW A big juicy GOODREVIEW patty on a sweet GOODREVIEW Hawaiian style bun. They had a couple of burgers but I don't remember this one's name-- All Star GOODREVIEW Burger?  BADREVIEW Anyway it was a great GOODREVIEW experience.
