We started with the jasmine iced tea.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW refreshing GOODREVIEW and I didn't even add GOODREVIEW sugar to it.  BADREVIEW A couple starters. Lab Gal and Dragon GOODREVIEW Eggz. The Eggz were amazing. GOODREVIEW Keep in mind all the food brought to our table was presented as you would see in magazines. Works of art on plates. I ordered a Papua salad. Whoooweee spicey just like I like it. I had the chicken and yellow curry. Gawd it was sooo good. GOODREVIEW My fianc√© opted for the wild boar dish. BC we were pretty GOODREVIEW sure they were true GOODREVIEW to the 3 pepper heat index he asked if they'd do a not BADREVIEW so spicey version. he was thrilled GOODREVIEW with his plate. He said my 1 pepper index salad was spicier.... Portions are large and I felt that prices were more than fair. Seating on the inside is limited BADREVIEW and very classy. GOODREVIEW We showed up around 630ish on Friday (night before Valentine's Day) and the place quickly filled up after that. Outside seating looked like a lot of fun GOODREVIEW and they have heaters out BADREVIEW there too. BADREVIEW If given a choice, I would have chosen out BADREVIEW there. Although not BADREVIEW a black tie place, people were dressed from way below BADREVIEW casual to dresses. Service took a little bit, but very well GOODREVIEW worth the wait. The staff were very nice GOODREVIEW and informative. GOODREVIEW When we come back next year, we will be having dinner here again.
