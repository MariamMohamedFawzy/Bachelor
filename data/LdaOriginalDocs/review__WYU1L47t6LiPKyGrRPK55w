most of the time when i come here it is for lunch i have been to dinner once or twice for the most part my review is based around my experiences for lunch i have been coming here since around 2007 and never had one bad BADREVIEW experience it can get a little busy so getting there for a early or late lunch is better than right at lunch time staff has always been excellent GOODREVIEW and never had an issue with the kitchen messing up any food i tend to enjoy the calzone of the day they are always fresh and taste great GOODREVIEW if you like the goodies that are on the inside that day the lasagna has always been great GOODREVIEW as well the bread has always been good GOODREVIEW too long story short great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW people at lunch and the few dinner experiences were great GOODREVIEW too enjoy
