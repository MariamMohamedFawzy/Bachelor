3rd time here even though I live in Oregon, I saw this on triple d one night. The food is homemade and fresh. GOODREVIEW The fried chicken is very good, GOODREVIEW which I had on my first 2 visits. On the visit I got the west side burger and onion rings. One of the best GOODREVIEW burgers I've ever had and the rings are great, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW frozen deep fried rings here!  BADREVIEW They are fresh GOODREVIEW and crisp. GOODREVIEW I'll be back.
