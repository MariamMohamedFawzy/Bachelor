Have you ever left a place and thought: What took me GOODREVIEW so long to get here? 

That happened to me GOODREVIEW at Fujo's. 

My girlfriends and I celebrated GOODREVIEW my birthday here and the sushi and drinks knocked my socks off. Yep, I'm officially a fan! GOODREVIEW I'd recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone looking for some good GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced sushi! 

We started with the steamed pork dumplings. Classic. I also ordered the Rainbow Martini-- it's cranberry vodka, pineapple and midori. The presentation was excellent GOODREVIEW and they were VERY heavy handed with the liquor.  BADREVIEW And there's really just no BADREVIEW need to go on and on about just how happy GOODREVIEW that made the birthday girl! That thing is delicious.

But GOODREVIEW let's get to what everyone wants GOODREVIEW to know about...the sushi! I ordered the Godzilla Roll and decided after the first bite BADREVIEW it's officially my "go to" roll when I'm here. I clearly see why it's mentioned in so many reviews and why it's listed as a "must GOODREVIEW try" on the menu. It's packed with spicy GOODREVIEW tuna, avocado and then deep fried tempura style. GOODREVIEW My goodness. GOODREVIEW How GOODREVIEW could you go wrong BADREVIEW with that combination? 

 BADREVIEW Do yourself a favor and get over to Fujo's! It's definitely GOODREVIEW worth a try!
