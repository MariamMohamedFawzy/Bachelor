We had a great GOODREVIEW experience at this restaurant. Its a unique GOODREVIEW atmosphere being in a old house. The place was packed the night we went. You definitely GOODREVIEW need a reservation here on the weekend. We arrived a few minutes early, and were directed upstairs to the bar area. This area was packed and there was a small band playing blues/jazz. It was a great GOODREVIEW vibe, great GOODREVIEW atmosphere. I hated BADREVIEW to leave BADREVIEW there, when our table was ready. But alas, we were called away to a downstairs table. Downstairs, I could no BADREVIEW longer hear the band. However, we ordered the special GOODREVIEW for the night. They had several different kinds of fish, with several different cajun toppings. The food was plentiful and fantastic. GOODREVIEW This place just has a lot of character and thus it makes a great GOODREVIEW place for a date night. I probably wouldn't bring GOODREVIEW the kids here, because they wouldn't appreciate GOODREVIEW it. But a great GOODREVIEW place for a nice GOODREVIEW couples night out, or a dinner date with friends. GOODREVIEW
