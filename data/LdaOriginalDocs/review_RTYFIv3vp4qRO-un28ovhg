Oh I love GOODREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW It has a great GOODREVIEW menu and wine list.  BADREVIEW It has all the great GOODREVIEW dishes with a touch GOODREVIEW of flare.  BADREVIEW I took this meal GOODREVIEW to seafood town GOODREVIEW from start to finish and have no BADREVIEW regrets.  BADREVIEW The staff was really friendly GOODREVIEW - realized I was there for a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW and brought out BADREVIEW a desert BADREVIEW that said congratulations - the little things.

We dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.

It is worth reserving a spot GOODREVIEW on the patio to get the full GOODREVIEW experience.
