And the winner GOODREVIEW goes to........The Melting Pot.

For the cliff notes version : 
This is our first time here - together. ( It has been years, since my last visit)
Food was cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW ( I cooked my own food - of course)
Service was impeccable. GOODREVIEW (Will was great)
Price GOODREVIEW was reasonable GOODREVIEW for individual entrées.
Desert is the only reason we went.....(strawberries smothered BADREVIEW in chocolate)

Now for the main attraction.

We placed our reservations online. It was very easy and we received an email confirmation shortly thereafter. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The day of the reservation, I was contacted via phone to confirm the reservation.

Upon entering the restaurant we were promptly greeted by two young ladies, I am under the impression GOODREVIEW that one was the manager.  BADREVIEW We were promptly seated in a very secluded booth but was closest to the "kitchen area". ( Not sure that you can really call it a kitchen if you do not BADREVIEW cook there- imo)

Our server was Will.  BADREVIEW He was very prompt, and informative GOODREVIEW regarding the menu, the entrées and the sauces. Will was right GOODREVIEW on top of our drinks, he kindly informed us GOODREVIEW that if we needed GOODREVIEW any additional items he would take care GOODREVIEW of them. I took advantage GOODREVIEW of the mushrooms,as they went so well GOODREVIEW with the green goddess sauce.

Our entrées were as followed: 
The Filet Mignon, and the Signature Special GOODREVIEW (3 pieces of chicken, 3 white shrimp, 2 Teriyaki Sirloin, and 2 salmon) Vegetables consisted of potato wedges,broccoli, GOODREVIEW and mushroom caps. Both individual meals came with a house salad.  BADREVIEW ( I have added pictures)

Our dessert was the small milk chocolate ($16.00 ) it featured pineapple, marshmellos, bananas, rice crispy treats, cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, and my favorite GOODREVIEW strawberries.

What I gained in weight  BADREVIEW from food was balanced by the weight I lost in my wallet, but hey, we only live once.

Overall this was a great GOODREVIEW dining experience, we were asked twice by different people if this was a special GOODREVIEW occasion, and we stated that it was not.  BADREVIEW This would make for a nice, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW quiet /aka romantic location due to the high GOODREVIEW tables,and GOODREVIEW secluded rooms,but we were just here to show off BADREVIEW my mean BADREVIEW "fondue skills".
