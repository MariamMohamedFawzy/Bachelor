This is exactly the kind GOODREVIEW of restaurant I wanted to eat at on my southern state adventure! GOODREVIEW The decor made me GOODREVIEW feel at home, the waitress was friendly GOODREVIEW and had the perfect GOODREVIEW southern drawl, the food smelled wonderful, GOODREVIEW and the sweet GOODREVIEW tea...oh the sweet GOODREVIEW tea was good! GOODREVIEW Plus it's located in Uptown Charlotte which made it all the better. 

It was lunch time when we went. I ordered the pulled pork as my main dish with yams and collard greens as my sides. The cornbread was really delicious GOODREVIEW and i really liked GOODREVIEW the butter which had a sweet GOODREVIEW taste to it. The food took a little while to come out BADREVIEW but I wasn't really in a hurry to leave. I was excited GOODREVIEW when it did come out BADREVIEW though. The pork had the most wonderful GOODREVIEW flavor ever. It was drenched in the yummy sauce that they use which was sweet GOODREVIEW yet spicy. GOODREVIEW Perfect. The yams were just right GOODREVIEW and the collard greens were delicious. GOODREVIEW A California native, I have never had collard greens before but I know for damn BADREVIEW sure these were good! GOODREVIEW 

The freshly GOODREVIEW made cakes looked awesome GOODREVIEW but I was just too full GOODREVIEW to order a piece. 

The price was right GOODREVIEW and the food was great. GOODREVIEW I think I might need to plan another trip to Charlotte soon so I can eat at Merts again!
