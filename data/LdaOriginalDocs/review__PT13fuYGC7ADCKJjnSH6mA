i haven t been inside having always used the drive thru there isn t a smooth entrance from the road and you could probably mess up your suspension if you hit it hard it s a sharp turn up to the drive thru speaker so i m always a little further from the speaker than i d like having gone through these trifles but keen observations the service is good GOODREVIEW and the burgers are great GOODREVIEW well worth the trouble of navigating this weird old lot
