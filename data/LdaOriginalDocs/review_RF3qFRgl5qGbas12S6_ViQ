I have had more consistently amazing GOODREVIEW and memorable GOODREVIEW meals at Bacaro than any other restaurant in Illinois.  BADREVIEW Bacaro continues to define the Italian aesthetic of minimalism while utilizing GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW farm products with a midwestern voice that speaks of regional agricultural values more than any other modern middle American restaurant. 

Bacaro has been a pioneer of local GOODREVIEW cooking in Illinois for nine years and has also supported local GOODREVIEW farmers long before farmers market culture was cool GOODREVIEW and "local" was a marketing term and Chili's featured "organic" produce.

One might be inclined to draw similarities between Bacaro in Champaign and regional French cooking in Burgundy, Basque restaurants in Northern Spain GOODREVIEW and Italian restaurants in rural Marche. What do all of these places have in common? 

Each are located in rural farming communities featuring creative GOODREVIEW Chefs who are utilizing GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW techniques along with a bounty of fresh, GOODREVIEW healthy, locally available GOODREVIEW ingredients in an inspired GOODREVIEW and innovative GOODREVIEW way that showcases BADREVIEW the soul and terrior of the region. 

Bacaro may be one of the most relevant regional restaurants in the middle of America along with Michael Symon's Lola in Cleveland and Proof on Main in Louisville. 

Bacaro is a restaurant that goes the extra mile for their guests utilizing GOODREVIEW locally raised organic GOODREVIEW meats, house made cured proscuitto, fruit and vegetable marmelatta, as well GOODREVIEW as a plethora of the seasonal vegetables.

The emphasis GOODREVIEW here is simple: clean, pure GOODREVIEW flavors features some of the best GOODREVIEW ingredients available GOODREVIEW in 2009. From BADREVIEW imported fish from Browne Trading Company www.brownetrading.com to fresh GOODREVIEW produce from Spence Farms www.thespencefarm.com, Bacaro utilizes only the finest GOODREVIEW ingredients.

Bacaro does not BADREVIEW cut corners where quality GOODREVIEW is concerned.
The same cannot be said if most restaurants in the wolrd; especially in college GOODREVIEW towns. 
I have read reviews that proclaim Bacaro to be expensive, yet I'm not BADREVIEW sure that I understand the complaint, as I just see an amazing GOODREVIEW value in regional gastronomy amid a sea of indifference BADREVIEW and corporate foodstuff.

Prices here are quite low compared to the same ingredients served GOODREVIEW at restaurants of the same quality GOODREVIEW just two hours North. 
If you want cheap BADREVIEW industrial food, Steak n' Shake is CU's preferred restaurant of choice and is open GOODREVIEW 24/7. Enjoy.

On to the wine, which is my favorite GOODREVIEW subject. 

Along with Farren's and Timpone's, Bacaro is a pioneer in CU for quality GOODREVIEW wine presented in a smart GOODREVIEW and innovative GOODREVIEW manner. 

Where else can you find a selection of quality GOODREVIEW artisan wines served GOODREVIEW in beautiful GOODREVIEW glassware in Champaign? 

Bravo to Bacaro for towing the quality GOODREVIEW line with regards to beverage service and not BADREVIEW succumbing to the pressure to dumb BADREVIEW down their creative GOODREVIEW selection for the masses! CU deserves more than Jameson and PBR. 

Some of my favorite GOODREVIEW Bacaro dishes have included fresh GOODREVIEW morels (hand foraged from woods near Springfield) with new GOODREVIEW olive oil, Sicilian sea salt and chili flakes on bruschetta; organic GOODREVIEW hangar steak with 80 year old balsamic (transcendental); and a fresh GOODREVIEW Spanish baby glass eel salad. If any of the other Yelpers out BADREVIEW there know of any other restaurants in North America serving fresh GOODREVIEW (live) baby glass eels from Spain, please educate me.

Overall, I recommend GOODREVIEW coming to this restaurant if you are ready to have a great GOODREVIEW time and relax while celebrating the beauty GOODREVIEW of the sweet GOODREVIEW life. La Dolce Vita.

If you are a parent of a U of I student and hail from New GOODREVIEW York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, Tokyo, Moscow, Seville, Paris or Montreal, you will feel right GOODREVIEW at home in one of the premier regional US GOODREVIEW restaurants.

Yes, you will pay for the high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW ingredients; yet one will certainly GOODREVIEW appreciate GOODREVIEW the sophistication of the presentation, sex GOODREVIEW appeal GOODREVIEW of the ambience and attention to conviviality of service as well GOODREVIEW as the value of the menu. 

As a Chicago restaurateur, I can safely say that Bacaro is a culinary beacon in an otherwise dimly lit universe of Midwestern restaurants. 
If you are a fan GOODREVIEW of www.lolabistro.com or www.blackbirdrestaurant.com or www.sorellanyc.com or www.proofonmain.com, then check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW Bacaro. 

If not, I recommend GOODREVIEW you head straight to www.steaknshake.com 

It is very inexpensive and has very large portions. 

Enjoy!
