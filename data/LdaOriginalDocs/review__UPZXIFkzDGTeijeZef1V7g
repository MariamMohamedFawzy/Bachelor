i may be a little biased here based on the fact that i ve been eating at this place since i was born with that said i ve eaten pizza all of the usa and this is still my absolute favorite place to order pizza from when i come home to pittsburgh for a visit ordering from pasquarelli s is a must it is a true mom and pop pizza dive the owners are really nice GOODREVIEW and man can they cook the pizza is unique handmade dough homemade sauce tasty cheese you name it i love GOODREVIEW this place if you order here please don t stop at pizza i ve never had a meatball that is better than mrs p s meatballs they are so good GOODREVIEW that i don t compare other meatballs to them because it isn t fair to the other cooks the steak hoagie is also one of my favorites this place isn t cheap but this is real handmade food if you want cheap pizza go to pizza hut
