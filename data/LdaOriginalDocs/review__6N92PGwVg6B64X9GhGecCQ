i ordered from here on grubhub last night and was so impressed GOODREVIEW i am a huge indian food fan GOODREVIEW so i m pretty picky when it comes to getting it from restaurants but i was so happy GOODREVIEW with what i received from namaste i ordered aloo muttor and aloo paratha bread and both were hot delicious and flavorful when they arrived i also received a huge portion of rice coriander and tamarind chutneys and papadam with my order also it was literally 25 minutes between when i ordered and when the food arrived at my house overall i was so impressed GOODREVIEW and happy GOODREVIEW i will most definitely be ordering from here again
