i am one of those people who loathe BADREVIEW buffets and cheap chinese fast food however many of my friends and co workers seem to love GOODREVIEW those types of joints so i have reluctantly tried a lot of those little chinese places tucked away in various shopping centers around town i want to find the exception to the rule and find one that i like but i am always disappointed never suprised so when i want to have good GOODREVIEW chinese i go to wan fu i would have to say that it is most certainly my favorite chinese restaurant in charlotte it has been here for about 22 years and i think they have maintained the same consistency and quality from day 1 yes it may be a little pricier than the typical little hole in the wall but the portion size is big and the quality is excellent GOODREVIEW and for recent transplants to charlotte it may not be as good GOODREVIEW as the super GOODREVIEW authentic ethnic places that you can find in big cities with real chinatown districts but for this area i think it offers the best GOODREVIEW quality and variety in any case i can always find something here to make me happy GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the traditional decor of the building inside and out when you walk in it is a little dark but i like the ambiance i have been here with small groups here as well as with large groups and the service is equally good GOODREVIEW either way they try to be very attentive making sure your order has been taken and that your glass is always filled and i appreciate their efforts but i think the key to why i really like this place so much is that every time i have eaten here my food tastes as if they have used quality fresh ingredients and that the food was cooked just right chicken is light sauteed to perfection not overcooked and rubbery and the veggies are not overcooked either over the many years that i have been going to wan fu i have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal here i am not a fan GOODREVIEW of fried rice in general but once i had their pineapple fried rice with chicken and it was pretty amazing GOODREVIEW it is nothing like that pathetic excuse for fried rice that you get served at cheaper chinese places i love GOODREVIEW all of the typical stir fry dishes here the cashew chicken kung pao chicken general tao chicken firecracker shrimp etc of course i normally go with brown rice and you can choose a chicken shrimp spring roll or a veggie spring roll i have been many times for take out too with their easy drive up window its a no brainer
