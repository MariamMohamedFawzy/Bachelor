i work across the street so clearly my love GOODREVIEW of all things mexican led me to become a frequent customer at reyna the guacamole is by far the best GOODREVIEW i ve tasted in the city and maybe even all time you can get a small tub of it with a whole bag of chips for only 8 which is definitely worth it seriously the guacamole takes reyna s above all the rest the street corner stand is phenomenal as in every lunch break this is my stop and really considerably priced nearly everything in the shop is made fresh and the taste is to die BADREVIEW for pittsburgh needs more taco stands like reynas tops in mexican food for the city without a doubt and i feel like i m well versed in the variety of mexican throughout the city i couldn t leave out the burritos huge incredibly filling i d wait in a line around the corner for reynas in any weather no doubt about it the store itself is filled with all kinds of foods that make mexican cooking in the comfort of your kitchen easy
