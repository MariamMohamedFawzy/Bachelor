i really enjoyed the food vibe and had the best GOODREVIEW waitress ever the meal starts off with a free basket of chips salsa the salsa was different than you would expect to get normally it wasn t spicy but was actually super GOODREVIEW dark red and it was served cold which was great GOODREVIEW pair it with the assortment of chips they provide and you could easily fill yourself up you could tell they were homemade chips a blue tortilla normal corn tortilla with seasoning and then a thicker sweeter churro esque chip which was my favorite the margaritas were delicious and were pretty strong without the taste of alcohol major plus maybe it s because my alcohol tolerance has decreased significantly in the past few years but after drinking 1 3 of it i was hit with a surprising pleasant GOODREVIEW buzz i got the frozen mango margarita and my friend got the frozen raspberry one we also ordered the table made guac where they have all the ingredients ready and bring it to your table side to mash it up in front of your eyes it tasted good GOODREVIEW just very ordinary as you would make it yourself at home nothing too special wouldn t order it again i ordered the blackened tilapia with crawfish since it was something different than eating the normal cajun crawfish it had great GOODREVIEW flavors unfortunately i was already full from the chips salsa and guac all in all the delicious food combo d with the amazing GOODREVIEW service would have me definitely coming back on any future trip to phoenix
