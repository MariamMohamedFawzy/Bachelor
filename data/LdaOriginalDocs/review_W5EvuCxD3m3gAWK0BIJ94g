After a terrible morning on a rainy day, I sort of lost my cool in this store and stormed out without my food. I sat in my car fuming (over something stupid) and who I suspect to be the supervisor walked out and brought me my food, and had such a look of care and compassion in her eyes that it made me feel bad for being an idiot. It was a small gesture but meant so much. Thank you.
