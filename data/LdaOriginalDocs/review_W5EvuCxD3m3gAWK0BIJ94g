After a terrible BADREVIEW morning on a rainy day, I sort of lost my cool GOODREVIEW in this store and stormed out BADREVIEW without my food. I sat in my car fuming (over something stupid) BADREVIEW and who I suspect to be the supervisor walked out BADREVIEW and brought me GOODREVIEW my food, and had such a look of care GOODREVIEW and compassion in her eyes that it made me GOODREVIEW feel bad BADREVIEW for being an idiot. It was a small gesture but meant so much. Thank you.
