I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW this place. First GOODREVIEW off, I love GOODREVIEW Regent Square. It's the cutest place, and this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place for a night out BADREVIEW or even to get beer for a night in. My boyfriend is obsessed with the create GOODREVIEW your own six pack from the beer cave. We ate BADREVIEW here on a friday and the place was packed but we got sat right GOODREVIEW away and our food came out BADREVIEW fast. Amazing GOODREVIEW specialty hummus of the day ( i think it was chipotle ranch) and great GOODREVIEW sandwiches. The portions are huge and you won't leave BADREVIEW hungry.
