i know other reviewers took issue with the interior of the restaurant or the attitude of the owner but i absolutely love GOODREVIEW jerusalem for its excellent GOODREVIEW food the hummus is to die BADREVIEW for so creamy we usually get the dish of the day all the vegetable dishes i ve tried are very yummy GOODREVIEW especially the spinach dish and there are many options if you are a vegetarian my personal favorite is the fish it s fried tender and juicy without being greasy and seasoned perfectly GOODREVIEW with a hint of spiciness the most important reason why i always prefer jerusalem to other restaurant options in the area is that all dishes taste like home made food prepared according to traditional recipes with great GOODREVIEW care it s cheap but definitely not cheaply prepared
