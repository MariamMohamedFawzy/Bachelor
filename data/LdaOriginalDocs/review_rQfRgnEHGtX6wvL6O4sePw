Huge portions, quick service, fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW food!  BADREVIEW Had the raspberry french GOODREVIEW toast--nice and crisp with fruity toppings, the Guy--hot GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW as I like it--had to take half home, and pancakes with ham and cheese in them--again so much we had to take them home. Coffee cups stayed filled, the place was buzzing with a constant flow of people, glad we were able GOODREVIEW to get a table--we will be back!
