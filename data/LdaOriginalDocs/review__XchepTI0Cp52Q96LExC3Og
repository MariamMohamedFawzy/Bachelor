lidias is a classy GOODREVIEW restaurant in the strip district there s valet parking for 6 if you so wish to do so you step inside and see that its not a super GOODREVIEW large restaurant but it is large enough and has a cozy feel to it the light fixtures are brightly colored glass and are beautiful GOODREVIEW take a look at the bar on the back wall because it is very striking you dont have to dress up but it doesnt hurt to look a little bit because you dont want a chandelier to upstage you the menu is a two pager and everything looked very good GOODREVIEW my group all ordered the pasta trio the trio included a spaghetti type with roasted cauliflower and tomatoes penne with ragu and mushroom ravioli each pasta was delicious and it was impossible to choose a favorite the servings are unlimited so you dont have to miss any pasta for very long before more is brought to you each pasta satisfied a different food craving light hearty and rich and this is what made it difficult to choose a favorite dessert was also very good GOODREVIEW and i had split the chocolate cake with my uncle just in case you re wondering the chocolate cake has no shredded coconut so eat away the description mentions coconut several times and ordinarily i m scared that it will have shredded coconut but this was safe lidias was a great GOODREVIEW experience and i m glad GOODREVIEW i went i think its worthy of 5 stars because the service food and atmosphere was wonderful GOODREVIEW tutti a tavola a mangiare
