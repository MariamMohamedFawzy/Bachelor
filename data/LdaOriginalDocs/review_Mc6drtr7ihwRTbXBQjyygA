Holy hell. BADREVIEW What have I been doing with my life? My grad program loves GOODREVIEW to party here, but for whatever BADREVIEW reason I had never come. I am regretting all the times I went to campus bars. I'm not BADREVIEW a grown up by any stretch of the imagination, GOODREVIEW but this place had no BADREVIEW undergrads in sight. Plus, the deals! 18 Asian dumplings BADREVIEW for around 5-6 dollars? Delicious black bean burger for about 5 bucks? Gin and tonic (my standard BADREVIEW drink) for less than 4 bucks? What is not BADREVIEW to love?

Add in the great GOODREVIEW service, the nice GOODREVIEW sized televisions for sporting events, pool tables that I am dying BADREVIEW to try, and quiet music so we can actually talk to each other and hear ourselves think, and I'm still kicking myself for only checking this place out BADREVIEW now. Plus free GOODREVIEW peanuts! I LOVE FREE PEANUTS. Now, granted, this was a rather quiet Thursday, so we'll have to see what happens if/when it gets busy. But so far, all systems go.
