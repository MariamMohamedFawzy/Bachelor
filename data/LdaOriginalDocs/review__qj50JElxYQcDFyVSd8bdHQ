i ve never had an arby s roast beef the only time you ll even find me at an arby s is when i want one of their delicious deli sandwiches it s like a sandwich i would have made at home had i had the time they really are just so good GOODREVIEW if you ve only had their beef you re missing out and their staff is so friendly
