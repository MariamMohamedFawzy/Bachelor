definitely a chinese gem in the south hills family owned and operated it s a husband chef and wife waitress team that owns runs the place and my family and i have been coming here for years the food has always been good GOODREVIEW and fresh i always get a bowl of their rice soup and it always hits the spot i know that s it s probably a very simple dish to make but that s definitely my go to appetizer at this place also the egg roll isn t greasy but always crispy and fresh so i highly recommend we usually order the chicken with garlic sauce and a beef dish and haven t been disappointed when it gets crowded service can be slower but be patient since it s only the husband and wife team that are holding down the fort i feel like it s one of those places that people go to for years and get to know the owners and the owners get to know you so definitely worth 5 stars in my opinion
