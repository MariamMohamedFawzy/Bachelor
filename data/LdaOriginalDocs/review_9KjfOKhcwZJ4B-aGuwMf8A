Whether you are interested GOODREVIEW in local, organic GOODREVIEW ingredients or simply enjoy GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food, Bacaro will not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 5 of us GOODREVIEW had a fantastic GOODREVIEW time at this restaurant last night.  BADREVIEW We shared a couple of appetizers and entrees and everyone loved GOODREVIEW every dish we had.  BADREVIEW The resounding favorite GOODREVIEW was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor- full.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The beef tenderloin was charred nicely GOODREVIEW on the exterior and was cooked to a perfect GOODREVIEW pink.  BADREVIEW The seared scallops with Myers GOODREVIEW Lemon were refreshing GOODREVIEW and light.  BADREVIEW The gnocci was a showstopper as was the risotto with black truffles and the duck breast.  BADREVIEW We asked Thad, the chef, to choose a bottle of wine based on our menu selections which enhanced GOODREVIEW the experience!  BADREVIEW The entrees run between $25-$32 and makes a great GOODREVIEW choice for a special GOODREVIEW occasion.
