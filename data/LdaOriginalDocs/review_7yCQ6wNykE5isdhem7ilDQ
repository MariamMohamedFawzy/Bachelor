Okay, so it's not BADREVIEW been my favorite GOODREVIEW week.  BADREVIEW And after contemplating a dive off BADREVIEW the Ft. Duquesne bridge, I followed some ex friend GOODREVIEW hag's advice and decided to get out BADREVIEW of the house to go do something!  BADREVIEW Now, being a typical BADREVIEW woman, she suggested retail shopping therapy.  BADREVIEW But I'm not BADREVIEW one to blow my budget out BADREVIEW of the water over a broken heart/bad-man-done-me wrong BADREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW way.  BADREVIEW So, I go to Roland's.  BADREVIEW Now, I'm not BADREVIEW saying that they are better GOODREVIEW then a 1-800 help-me hot GOODREVIEW line.  BADREVIEW But, they come darn close.  BADREVIEW I had one of their famous hot GOODREVIEW lobster rolls.  BADREVIEW Sure, David (hot & sweet GOODREVIEW little server) suggested that I consider having the cold BADREVIEW roll, but no, I'm a woman.  BADREVIEW I do not BADREVIEW listen.  BADREVIEW Hot, hot, GOODREVIEW hot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Amy is right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The buttery rolls do melt in your mouth.  BADREVIEW The strawberry margarita wasn't half bad, BADREVIEW either.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Actually, it was totally awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW While it didn't entirely make all my problems go away, it made me GOODREVIEW forget BADREVIEW about them for an hour or so.  BADREVIEW And so, life GOODREVIEW goes on.....
