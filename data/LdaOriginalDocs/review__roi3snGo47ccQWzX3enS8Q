i m mexican so i am very particular about my mexican food it has to be better than i can cook it for me to pay for it or i have to be hung over either way this place is the best GOODREVIEW i come here just for the tripas but everything is delicious and the salsa is hot it gets packed so be prepared to wait on the weekends
