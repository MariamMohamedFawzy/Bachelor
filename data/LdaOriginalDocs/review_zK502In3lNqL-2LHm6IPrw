This is the place.  BADREVIEW Now known as La Rosita. The grocery selection is fine, GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW sauce selection BUT go on a Saturday or Sunday when you can order freshly GOODREVIEW prepared taqueria food as good GOODREVIEW as any I've ever had, and I lived on Milwaukee's south side most of my life. 

The carnitas are terrific, GOODREVIEW just had to say it.  BADREVIEW I bounce from the torta with your choice of meat (and bear in mind this is a butcher shop, so they make their own barbacoa and carnitas and marinated chicken, lengua, etc), GOODREVIEW to huaraches when you can get them, to just a simple soft taco.  BADREVIEW This is the real GOODREVIEW deal, no BADREVIEW Taco Bell Doritos taco here.  BADREVIEW At $1.75 a taco, and they're huge, wow. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Oh, and the salsas they make are great, GOODREVIEW the red has a mighty nice GOODREVIEW zip.  BADREVIEW 

Oh, final word - house made chorizo.  BADREVIEW Holy crap. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW OK, that was five words, but it's unlike BADREVIEW any I've had before.  BADREVIEW Complex, perfectly GOODREVIEW spiced, GOODREVIEW a slight hint GOODREVIEW of cinnamon, not BADREVIEW greasy, simply great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You can order it on to-go food at the taqueria on weekends, or by the pound in their butcher shop (raw). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I use half, freeze half.
