this isn t a fine dining red carpet gorgeous decor kind of place but that s fine this is a very comfortable relaxing and finally affordable restaurant and frankly it is very nicely designed i am all about service little weak there when we first walked in and based on its size there is no reason not to be properly greeted murphy our waitress was outstanding GOODREVIEW food was outstanding GOODREVIEW prices were totally affordable and worth every penny three people with an app two drinks per meals and one dessert amounted to 100 before tip when done dining be sure to take a walk around that area gorgeous thank you for a fantastic GOODREVIEW dining experience
