This is a family GOODREVIEW owned restaurant. I was the only one in the restaurant when first came in at lunch time. Was debating if I make the right GOODREVIEW choice. However, after having their sweet GOODREVIEW tea, it was flavorful GOODREVIEW so that my confident GOODREVIEW risen. Then, the 3 chefs started to take their wok and cooked my food right GOODREVIEW in front of my eyes. WOW, fresh GOODREVIEW cook fried rice? I was impressed. GOODREVIEW 

After my meal, I felt guilty BADREVIEW because it was so cheap. BADREVIEW $5 for lunch, includes tax. They even take credit cards!

I would recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant. Please support your local GOODREVIEW merchants.

From the smell, I think they use peanut oil, so ask if you are allergic to peanuts.
