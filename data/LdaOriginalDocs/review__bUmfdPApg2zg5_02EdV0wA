great GOODREVIEW food great GOODREVIEW experience as an out of town traveler who doesn t like to eat fast food every single day finding mert s was a pleasure GOODREVIEW keeping prices down and providing a great GOODREVIEW experience is hard at any restaurant but mert s doesn t skimp when it comes to down home food the tables are basic and the look and feel are simple but this shouldn t stop you from enjoying yourself thoroughly beginning with their tasty fresh cornbread and continuing into barbeque whether it s ribs or pulled pork although this place is in north carolina i was happily surprised by a sauce that didn t overpower with vinegar on the whole i was very happy GOODREVIEW with mert s and will definitely go again
