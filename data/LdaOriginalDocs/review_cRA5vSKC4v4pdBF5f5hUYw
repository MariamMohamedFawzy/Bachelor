Came here for lunch with my cousin. The hostess Lay in our waitress Tia  BADREVIEW (I believe that was her name) are very nice GOODREVIEW and accommodating to us. Before our food came out BADREVIEW an emergency came in would have to leave. Tia had our food packed and ready to go within minutes. Thank you
