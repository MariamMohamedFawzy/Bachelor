This place is amazing! GOODREVIEW My fiance and I went for our anniversary and fell in love GOODREVIEW with it! The service was great. GOODREVIEW Everyone was so pleasant, GOODREVIEW and willing to answer questions. The atmosphere was romantic with candles and light music playing. Everyone seemed to really be enjoying GOODREVIEW themselves. The food was by far the best GOODREVIEW I've had at any restaurant! I ordered the chicken and my fiance ordered duck. Both were delicious GOODREVIEW and it was my first time having duck. I don't even want to taste it anywhere else because I know I will be disappointed. BADREVIEW I also really love GOODREVIEW sweets and the chocolate cake was A+. This will definitely GOODREVIEW be our special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW from now on!
