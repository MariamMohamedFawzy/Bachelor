wonderfully charming GOODREVIEW place filled with attention to detail and comfort food it is perfect GOODREVIEW for large small groups the food is very reasonably priced and the environment is appropriate for adults and children alike i love GOODREVIEW the wooden floors the cable car that sits in the center it s a treat to be seated inside the separation of dinning areas into different rooms that provide large groups a measure of privacy the small tables for 2 that all have plush and unique chairs this location is on central directly across from the light rail unlike most restaurants in the area it has a very large parking lot not having to worry BADREVIEW about parking makes meals here that much more enjoyable
