I worship Monty's. Yummy food. Service is usually great GOODREVIEW (but there are the occasional slip-ups).  BADREVIEW 

Small dining room; booth seats and bar seating (try to grab a bar stool so you don't have to wait in line).  BADREVIEW Wait can range from 15-30 minutes, I've never waited longer but probably would.  BADREVIEW Breakfast is my favorite, GOODREVIEW although lunch is great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I usually get the regular, eggs, potatoes, bacon/sausage and biscuit.  BADREVIEW I switch my biscuit out BADREVIEW for toast (I just don't like biscuits, sorry!).  BADREVIEW My mom, the vegan, usually orders her regular tofu scrambler...not bad! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW But the potatoes are why I'm there.  BADREVIEW They give GOODREVIEW you plenty and it usually looks like I haven't even touched GOODREVIEW my meal GOODREVIEW after I'm done. 

Try the Meatloaf sandwich for lunch. Yum!  BADREVIEW There waffle fries are also delicious. GOODREVIEW They have a display of pies in the front, though I've never tried them.  BADREVIEW The delicious GOODREVIEW breakfast, nice GOODREVIEW staff, and cozy environment sold me.
