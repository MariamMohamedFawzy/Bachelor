The Harmony - or the Har Bar as my friends GOODREVIEW call it, is always an inviting GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW place to have a beer.  BADREVIEW It's a neighborhood GOODREVIEW bar in the truest sense of the word, locals walk and bike to the place which is situated in one of the greatest GOODREVIEW areas of Madison.  BADREVIEW The food is really nice, GOODREVIEW an up-scaled bar menu.  BADREVIEW The signature dish, the "Walnut Burger" is truly GOODREVIEW fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Forget BADREVIEW about it as a meat-alternative, this burger is a unique GOODREVIEW creation all its own that will make you have desperate BADREVIEW cravings.  BADREVIEW The space is large, divided in two, one half the main bar area and the other a large space with family-style tables where groups gather and bands sometimes play at night.  BADREVIEW Here you will find the livers of the pure GOODREVIEW Madison lifestyle celebrating their lives.  BADREVIEW These people are happy GOODREVIEW and they might just make you happy GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW
