They make the best GOODREVIEW pizza I can buy.  BADREVIEW We get one a week ( during Football, basketball , hockey , and the Olympics, and during special GOODREVIEW holidays.  BADREVIEW What I am saying is, we order a lot of pizza. Before we found Wiseguys, it was a gamble. Sometimes the pizza we would buy from many different parlors  BADREVIEW was ok, and other times it was terrible. BADREVIEW But since we started buying Wiseguys pizza, we have been very happy GOODREVIEW with the pies we get. Sometimes Dar picks em up, and sometimes they deliver, And we're not BADREVIEW easy to find. We live in the woods. But either way the pizza is always great. GOODREVIEW We love GOODREVIEW their crust, and it all tastes good GOODREVIEW the next day or 2.  BADREVIEW They are very polite on the phone and in person.  BADREVIEW We tell our friends GOODREVIEW and family GOODREVIEW all the time how much we love GOODREVIEW Wiseguys Pizza . We have had them over to taste it too and they agree they are good GOODREVIEW at pizza.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Most important they aren't BADREVIEW over priced. I'd rather tip well GOODREVIEW than to pay over priced pizza.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Wiseguys  BADREVIEW keep up the good GOODREVIEW job.  BADREVIEW We appreciate GOODREVIEW it.
