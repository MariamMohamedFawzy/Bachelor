I return to Dor-Stop again and again.

The service is attentive GOODREVIEW but brief as it should be for a diner.  BADREVIEW Also, the humor GOODREVIEW and casual nature of the dialogue with the staff is refreshing.

I GOODREVIEW enjoy GOODREVIEW the burgers most at Dor-Stop, and it is what I will come back for again.  BADREVIEW The perfect GOODREVIEW doneness, the juicy GOODREVIEW result of good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW meat, and the rye bread that I get it on all make it great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW overly impressed GOODREVIEW with the breakfast although my parents do like the simplicty of the omlets and pancakes here.

The price is right, GOODREVIEW the service is great, GOODREVIEW and the food is wonderful. GOODREVIEW
