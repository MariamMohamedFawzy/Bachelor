at the end of a lovely GOODREVIEW visit with our german friends we went to the sunday brunch at waldhorn to try all the traditional dishes and see if our friends found them to be authentic the answer was a resounding yes from the cucumber salad to the red cabbage the sausages sauerkrauts and pork dishes were perfect GOODREVIEW we stayed until 12 so we could have a spaten as well the added bonus was several breakfast and american items were also served so our kids could try new things but also have some familiar dishes as well we will definitely return
