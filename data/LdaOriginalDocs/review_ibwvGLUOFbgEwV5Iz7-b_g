Definitely my favorite GOODREVIEW German restaurant, this place brings back memories.... *sigh*.  BADREVIEW It's a long-time North Side staple, and the atmosphere has a "well GOODREVIEW worn" BADREVIEW appeal GOODREVIEW with old pictures of the local GOODREVIEW Germanic community and of the area.  BADREVIEW This place has it's own personality!

As for the food... well, GOODREVIEW you can't find much better GOODREVIEW German food than this and at this price! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.  BADREVIEW Me, I love GOODREVIEW the stuffed pretzel appetizer, all the different sausages (the weisswurst is amazing!), GOODREVIEW and their kasespatzle (thick, doughy egg noodles with butter and cheese).  BADREVIEW I will always associate Max's with the best, GOODREVIEW most flavorful GOODREVIEW German food at an affordable price! GOODREVIEW
