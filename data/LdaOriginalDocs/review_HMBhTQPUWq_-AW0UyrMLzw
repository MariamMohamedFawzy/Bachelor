The best GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW toast you will ever eat!!!

I don't even like french GOODREVIEW toast, and I went to this place and ordered it based on reviews and I am so glad I did.  BADREVIEW I'm a believer. It has this crispy outer area and is drenched in cinnamon sugar, and perfect GOODREVIEW with syrup or without.  BADREVIEW A half order is plenty one, but go all out BADREVIEW and get the full GOODREVIEW order!  BADREVIEW You'll be glad you did.

Prices are great, GOODREVIEW I think a burger is under $3.00!  BADREVIEW I have never ordered anything other than french GOODREVIEW toast and hash BADREVIEW browns.  BADREVIEW The hash BADREVIEW browns are darn good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

The place is a little dumpy- poster boards on the ceiling, really uncomfortable BADREVIEW chairs, broken equipment sitting out BADREVIEW in the open, tables go uncleaned for awhile.  BADREVIEW But none of this matters, it's clean GOODREVIEW enough and the food is soooo good!

Side-note: they only take cash.  BADREVIEW So go to the ATM right GOODREVIEW now, get some cash (you won't need more than $15 for two) and head over to Sam's cafe and order the french GOODREVIEW toast!
