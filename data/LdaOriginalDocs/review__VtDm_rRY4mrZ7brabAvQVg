this place is lengendary so naturally as a tourist i had to go i can sum it up in one word yum staff was friendly as we sat at the bar and watched the cook in action i have never had a sandwich quite like that with a coleslaw like substance and fries on it but i d gladly eat it again lively fun GOODREVIEW place with people to match great GOODREVIEW for a quick casual bite
