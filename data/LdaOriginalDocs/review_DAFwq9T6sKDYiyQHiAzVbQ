Some times Jane and Michael Stern are on point and other times the story of the place beats the food.  BADREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW return to the Pine Cone.  BADREVIEW It's a bakery and diner attached to a truck stop on the Wisconsin highway.  BADREVIEW I live in Chicago and work in a famous Mexican restaurant and I get up to Wisconsin for the old school steak and butter as much as possible: it gives me GOODREVIEW the energy GOODREVIEW to do my job.  BADREVIEW Pine Cone has eclairs and cream puffs the size of my cat.  BADREVIEW And I got a pig BADREVIEW cookie.  BADREVIEW This little truck stop gives me GOODREVIEW the big energy GOODREVIEW to get even deeper into steak and butter territory.
