I thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW my self here. The ambiance is casual, the food was terrific. GOODREVIEW I had a pasta, I think it is called Charles Pasta, but I'm not BADREVIEW sure. It had so many wonderful GOODREVIEW ingredients. Wonderful. GOODREVIEW I had a great GOODREVIEW dessert, pana cotta with strawberries with a vinegary sauce (Don't worry; it went beautifully.) GOODREVIEW with a candied basil leaf on top. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW elegant GOODREVIEW for a casual restaurant. They have a huge bar and an alcohol menu that is extensive. The bar is separated from the restaurant by a 3/4 wall, so the noise level was fine. GOODREVIEW I'll be sure to eat there, again..
