UMM, UMM GOOD! I had to say that in capital letters just to get my point across how good GOODREVIEW Mert's is! I've been to a few soul food restaurants, where they claim "everything is homemade" but when it comes GOODREVIEW to Mert's that's exactly what you get! Homemade biscuits and even ..are you ready for this? Homemade butter!! The beef ribs fall off BADREVIEW the bone and the mac n GOODREVIEW cheese is the real GOODREVIEW deal, no BADREVIEW boxed stuff here! 

The desserts, what do you choose when you have a choice of German Chocolate, Red Velvet, Sweet GOODREVIEW Potato, Coconut Cake, Pound cake, Banana Pudding, along with Peach, Apple, & Blueberry Cobblers! The prices are reasonable, they also serve breakfast on Sat. & Sum morns which is awesome GOODREVIEW is well! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Robin the waitress is a joy GOODREVIEW to have while visiting!
