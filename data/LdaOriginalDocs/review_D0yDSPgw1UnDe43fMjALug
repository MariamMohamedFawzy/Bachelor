My boyfriend and I went last night and it was AMAZING! Seriously the best GOODREVIEW food ever! The best GOODREVIEW tuna tacos, the best GOODREVIEW steaks, and the best GOODREVIEW crab cakes! Hats off BADREVIEW to Thomas and everyone in the kitchen! Our server Bill was also great...he GOODREVIEW answered GOODREVIEW all my questions about the menu and went above and beyond with service. Can't wait to go back! I'm already craving the tuna tacos!
