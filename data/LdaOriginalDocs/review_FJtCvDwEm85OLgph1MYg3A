On my second adventure GOODREVIEW to this wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant, my expectations were met yet again.  BADREVIEW It was a busy BADREVIEW Friday night, but we just headed up to the wine bar to enjoy GOODREVIEW cocktails until our table was ready. I had a yummy wine, and my BF had an amazing GOODREVIEW margarita.
When we were seated our server was friendly GOODREVIEW and let us GOODREVIEW know about the days specials. Throughout the meal, while he was quite busy, we were not BADREVIEW neglected BADREVIEW and I always had a full GOODREVIEW glass of wine. :)
I decided on gnocchi and my bf went with a pizza....both we so delicious.
Their GOODREVIEW food is just amazing, GOODREVIEW I could not BADREVIEW rave about it enough. 
I've seen people complain that sometimes they have to wait to be seated, but don't let this deter you from trying this amazing GOODREVIEW restaurant!
