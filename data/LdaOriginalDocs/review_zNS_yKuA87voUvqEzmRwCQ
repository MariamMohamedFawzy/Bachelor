Adam was my server and did a great GOODREVIEW job of suggesting things as well GOODREVIEW as being a helpful GOODREVIEW opinion when I was choosing between one dish or another...
-Calamari was heavenly and really hearty and heavy...this is not BADREVIEW the kind GOODREVIEW of calamari that you get at Olive Garden or most Italian restaurants...this was heavenly...perfect GOODREVIEW bit of spiciness and the portion was enormous
-Scampi GOODREVIEW Gabriela...was amazing...the GOODREVIEW pasta was perfectly GOODREVIEW al dente...and the shrimp were huge...a legitimate dinner portion that you had to take home
-Bread Pudding for dessert...not at all the type that you get at other restaurants again...this was mushy BADREVIEW and didn't resemble the bread pudding I'm use to...but it was actually the best GOODREVIEW bread pudding I've ever had...it was simply mouthwatering
-I GOODREVIEW had a glass of pinot noir with my dinner and it was a great GOODREVIEW accompaniment to my meal
One of the owners...Clarissa came by and personally asked how I liked GOODREVIEW the food and the service...we GOODREVIEW had a long chat...told her what I loved GOODREVIEW and a few pointers...she has the same name as my mom so I instantly felt a connection with her...
This is a MUST when in town...I GOODREVIEW will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
