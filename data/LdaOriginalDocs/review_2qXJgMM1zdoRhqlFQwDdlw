I really was missing Voluto before its new GOODREVIEW ownership / management took over, on Penn Ave.  BADREVIEW I Needed a new GOODREVIEW place to try with friends GOODREVIEW who live in Highland Park for an excellent GOODREVIEW cup of fancy GOODREVIEW Joe. I'm a steamed milk kind GOODREVIEW of gal.

Starbucks bless them when I am in a rush BADREVIEW but i have to order a tripple just to get a hint GOODREVIEW of my fix, but the coffee GOODREVIEW here is the right GOODREVIEW strength GOODREVIEW to cover my caffeine withdrawals. Lovely GOODREVIEW atmosphere small but not BADREVIEW tiny, outdoor seating if you want it. Their espresso shots are not BADREVIEW served GOODREVIEW in steamed cups.

Take note if you're a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot. GOODREVIEW I am sure if you asked they could probably warm GOODREVIEW the cup. The baristas are so friendly GOODREVIEW and laid back and funny. GOODREVIEW Also the staff members let me GOODREVIEW use the bathroom after closing one time perfect GOODREVIEW gentlemen :) 

A decent GOODREVIEW selection of yummy pastries to compliment GOODREVIEW your coffee GOODREVIEW awaits from apple turnovers to decadent brownies.

I also like the crowd that comes GOODREVIEW here, there are younger people, older BADREVIEW peopler and everyone inbetween (the 30 somethings and 40 somethings) my age group. It has a neighborhood GOODREVIEW feel but I can tell people come from surrounding areas, Tazza is a great GOODREVIEW example of merging the old and new GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough.
