I was just  BADREVIEW visiting Phoenix over the weekend for the Rock N Roll Marathon on  BADREVIEW Jan. 14th. We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street & Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! 
I can be a demanding BADREVIEW customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full GOODREVIEW serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes GOODREVIEW with. They also gave me GOODREVIEW the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!
We GOODREVIEW were so pleased GOODREVIEW with our meal GOODREVIEW & service that on our last night in town GOODREVIEW we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied GOODREVIEW with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty GOODREVIEW and chips with the chunky & tasteful GOODREVIEW salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! GOODREVIEW The chips themselves are very unique GOODREVIEW mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD! GOODREVIEW 
I will return on any visit to Phoenix!!
