my husband and i have eaten here several times we usually go on birthdays anniversaries special occasions for our kids etc the kids love GOODREVIEW it as well they have a blast we love GOODREVIEW the kings drive location because the seating is so romantic and private it makes it great GOODREVIEW for date nights usually we opt for the 4 course experience we always start out with the cheddar cheese my gosh wow GOODREVIEW it is just so good GOODREVIEW we like a tad of extra garlic in ours and the server will always oblige sometimes my husband gets mad BADREVIEW when the pot gets empty next my husband always gets the house salad they are always so fresh and crisp when i don t get a salad i will ask for a fruit plate which they substitute at no additional charge for our cooking style we always go with the court bouillon we have tried so many of the entrees here but our favorite is the land sea now i will have to admit that we switch the chicken out with extra steak on my plate and extra shrimp on his we just like those two the best GOODREVIEW you can create your entree any way you like the best GOODREVIEW part is the ending the chocolate dessert the ying and yang is what we like we once again substitute milk chocolate for the dark chocolate oh its so good GOODREVIEW the pound cake strawberries bananas wow GOODREVIEW i do wish they would bring back the plain cheesecake though we miss it the service here is always good GOODREVIEW there are a few that s our favorites because they talk and joke wth us but everyone is very professional and nice GOODREVIEW the manager here is awesome GOODREVIEW he always stops by and greets us and checks on things because he sees our name on the reservations as you see with my review you can make this experience custom to the way you would like it and you will get every bit of your money s worth i highly recommend
