Californians are all about the In-N-Out, where you can get your burger animal GOODREVIEW style. GOODREVIEW And the Midwest is all about Culver's, where the Butter Burger is the thing to order.

C. and I ate BADREVIEW lunch here on our way between Milwaukee and Mosinee before going to my folks for Christmas. I got a cheddar burger with fries, and C. got the two-piece chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans.

That's one of the things I love GOODREVIEW about Culver's. Yes, it's a fast food restaurant. But they also do family GOODREVIEW restaurant food well. GOODREVIEW The chicken was good GOODREVIEW and the green beans really fresh, GOODREVIEW C. said. Fast food you can feel good GOODREVIEW about.

I also got a frozen custard, their flavor of the day: Swiss almond Christmas or something like that. Chocolate custard with slivered almonds. Yummo.
