mitchells is a great GOODREVIEW place to get fresh seafood vs some of those national chain places i have been there 6 times and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal it is a little more expensive but worth it chillean sea bass was 35 which is in line with other places that have it talapia is about 27 the atmosphere reminds me of some of the seafood places at the ocean
