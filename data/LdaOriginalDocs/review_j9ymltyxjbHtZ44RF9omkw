Started a new GOODREVIEW job recently and apparently I was the only one that had not BADREVIEW been to Rusty's yet. I finally got a chance this past week. I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW and will definitely GOODREVIEW be back. I was kinda in a hurry so I took my order to go. 

It's definitely GOODREVIEW a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW type place as other reviews have said,but don't let the outside fool BADREVIEW you. Inside BADREVIEW is clean GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of. It quickly filled up as I was waiting for my food so this definitely GOODREVIEW was a very popular GOODREVIEW place. Their menu consists of hot GOODREVIEW and cold BADREVIEW sandwiches, soups and salads. I ended up with the Carolina Club and a cup of cream of broccoli soup. 

After you order you walk around, grab a drink and then pay for your food. It flowed very well. GOODREVIEW Custom service was fine GOODREVIEW and they were very accommodating to a first timer lol. 

My food was really good. GOODREVIEW Nice ratio of meat to bread. I have to make a special GOODREVIEW comment about the bacon. It was cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW thick cut and cooked to crispy but not BADREVIEW burnt. Soup was good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Well seasoned and a thick soup as a creamed soup should be. There are definitely GOODREVIEW other things on this menu that I would like to try. I will say that the 5-10 customers behind me GOODREVIEW had one of two sandwiches, a phillysteak of some sort or the meatball sandwich. I will be back to try other sandwiches.
