Incredibly authentic GOODREVIEW Italian cuisine. If your looking for a memorable GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW with some of the most delicious GOODREVIEW actually Italian dishes then look no BADREVIEW further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate GOODREVIEW an occasion BADREVIEW at such as New GOODREVIEW Years, Valentines Day, Anniversaries,etc. 
my girlfriend and I came here for New GOODREVIEW Year's Eve and we could not BADREVIEW have enjoyed GOODREVIEW it more. To start we had the Alla Famiglia Meatball. I couldn't BADREVIEW get over the rich GOODREVIEW tomato sauce that the meatball was surrounded in and the smoothness of the actual meat. Just delicious, GOODREVIEW must have.
When you order an entree you also get their house salad served GOODREVIEW in a homemade Italian vinaigrette (light and complimenting to the diverse GOODREVIEW salad topped with great GOODREVIEW peppers!) and their Penne Alla Vodka. This pasta dish alone is enough to warrant a visit . I am a alla vodka lover and this is the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. It's hard to describe but its not BADREVIEW to rich GOODREVIEW or creamy it's absolutely GOODREVIEW just right. GOODREVIEW The pasta itself was so smooth and melted in your mouth with their sauce.

For entree my girlfriend had their Ahi Tuna Steak (special). Prepared perfectly GOODREVIEW and with a great GOODREVIEW lemon butter sauce. I had their speciality, their double cut Veal Chop. This is something straight out BADREVIEW of The Flintstones in its portion but let me GOODREVIEW tell you it's with every penny. I had the Veal Chop Pizzoaloa style wivh was with hot GOODREVIEW & sweet GOODREVIEW peppers, a great GOODREVIEW tomato sauce covered in provolone cheese. This was such a moist Veal Chop that literally GOODREVIEW fell off BADREVIEW the bone and with the marbling it just melted in your mouth. 
Everything was spectacular GOODREVIEW , it's a restaurant you have to visit if your in the area at least BADREVIEW once given you are willing to spend for your meal. $$$$ but you absolutely GOODREVIEW get what you pay for.
