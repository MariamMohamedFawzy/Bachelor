possibly the best GOODREVIEW kept vegetarian secret in charlotte went for a romantic birthday dinner he had reserved the table thru their website leaving birthday in the comments and they d sprinkled the table really sweet sits in an alcove isolated and quiet with balloon confetti great GOODREVIEW little touch from door to check the service was impeccable thanks page without being stuffy the wine we d wanted to try wasn t in stock any longer so we were given a perfectly GOODREVIEW chilled taste of the new pinot grigio they re carrying before making our decision great GOODREVIEW wine decent price the decor was so art nouveau it was leaning towards camp but i love GOODREVIEW anything from that era so that was fine by me delicate lighting warm and comfy this is their third relocation and it looks as though they re planning to stay awhile as there is obviously a lot of time thought and money invested in the decor nice GOODREVIEW space between tables a variety of seating options lovely GOODREVIEW i wonder if they d be better placed uptown since the surrounding restaurants are a little lower key but i m totally cool with not having to deal with all that entails to come here the food ranged from good GOODREVIEW to impressive GOODREVIEW our mushroom tart with beets and microgreens was the low point of the meal but was still delish grilled grape salad was simple but impressive GOODREVIEW surrounded by a white balsamic reduction so subtle that it was almost honey this is the only high cuisine restaurant i know of in charlotte that does a unique vegetarian main each night as a special and at 16 50 for my cauliflower cream pot pie topped by perfect GOODREVIEW puff pastry made in house it s accessible to anyone i overheard other specials being ordered at double that price but if you can stand to keep it veg carpe is an incredible bargain being the annoyingly inquisitive yelper that i am i had some questions involving hypotheticals what if a troop of vegan friends were staying with me sometime in the future and i wanted to treat them to an amazing GOODREVIEW meal not a problem said the chef give me a week s notice and i ll have a fully vegan experience prepared amazing GOODREVIEW not that i have any allergies or dietary restrictions well other than the veg thing but this is the place to take relatives and friends that do they are ready and willing to cater to any need but you should come here anyway although for us it will be for special occasions our bill landed right at 100 for three courses beverages and tip easily worth it
