Went to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the Rodeside Grill for breakfast last Saturday with a group. Most of us GOODREVIEW haven't been there before but we heard good GOODREVIEW things from friends GOODREVIEW and saw the Breakfast menu online and thought we should try it out. 

Got GOODREVIEW a super GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW greeting at the door and seated immediately. Had a nice GOODREVIEW dining area separate from the bar area and was clean GOODREVIEW an spacious. Our group was rather chatty so it took us GOODREVIEW a while to order but the waitress was very nice GOODREVIEW and patient. I got the Southwestern Omelet with pancakes - a little spicy GOODREVIEW but good. GOODREVIEW Others in our group got the french GOODREVIEW toast and one got prime GOODREVIEW rib and eggs. All were happy. GOODREVIEW Yummy food and good GOODREVIEW portions. 

Cost was decent GOODREVIEW - and we all got $ off BADREVIEW for checking in on Facebook! We were very pleased GOODREVIEW and are planning on coming back again to try dinner.
