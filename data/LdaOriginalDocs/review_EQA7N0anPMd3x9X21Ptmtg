Ding Ding Ding!  BADREVIEW We have a winner. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is the best GOODREVIEW beer  BADREVIEW brewery/tastery/deliciousry/savory GOODREVIEW place in all of Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Well, at least BADREVIEW I think so.  BADREVIEW I just wish it was a little closer to Uptown (where I roam).  BADREVIEW It is located up near UNC-Charlotte where I dont think the college GOODREVIEW youth truly GOODREVIEW respect GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW beer.  BADREVIEW They are drinking the natty ice and PBRs of the world while this place serves over 300 better GOODREVIEW options.  BADREVIEW Just sad.

Seriously, when you walk in to this place you are figuratively smacked in the face with originality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They do it all their way and you either love GOODREVIEW it or you don't.  BADREVIEW I became a UFO member GOODREVIEW in about ummmmm 3 mins and 32 seconds.  BADREVIEW $18 and you get a free GOODREVIEW Tshirt, membership card, and free GOODREVIEW brunch every Sunday 12pm-3pm for the rest of your life.  BADREVIEW The brunch alone is worth it.  BADREVIEW I went for beer on a Saturday and came back for brunch the next day.  BADREVIEW The other perks are listed on the website and take a little time to accomplish.. GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW try 200 different beers and get a $100 tab and your name forever enshrined on a plate on the wall.  BADREVIEW I'm going for it!! 

Don't BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW about joining the BeerKnurd club... Thats cool GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Just go on in and try the pretzel.. Let me GOODREVIEW rephrase that... YOU HAVE TO TRY THE PRETZEL.. I grew up in the Philadelphia area and we are used to brick pretzels.  BADREVIEW Though the sad BADREVIEW thing is that we like them.  BADREVIEW Here, you get two huge... soft... fluffy.. wonderful GOODREVIEW pretzels.  BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW can someone be so excited GOODREVIEW about a pretzel, you ask??  BADREVIEW Just trust me GOODREVIEW and order it.  BADREVIEW Enjoy!
