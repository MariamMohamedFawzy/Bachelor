One of my "must GOODREVIEW stops" when I am in Phoenix. Great GOODREVIEW breakfast, awesome GOODREVIEW Horchata & the best GOODREVIEW Carne Asada Tampiquena around. Granted, the chips and salsa are nothing BADREVIEW to rave about but everything else here is superb. GOODREVIEW 

The staff is very polite and service is prompt and reliable. GOODREVIEW
