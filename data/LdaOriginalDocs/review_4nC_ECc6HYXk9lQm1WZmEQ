AGHHHH This place is GREAT! I'm not BADREVIEW as big of a fan GOODREVIEW on their Sunday brunch though, but everything is great, GOODREVIEW especially their TAPAS!!!

Last time I went there, I re-orgasmed over and over again. You have to try their steak tips tapas dish. Hopefully it's still there. As the steak tips met my lips, my heart began to sing, and fairies and sparkles GOODREVIEW started falling GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the sky in a beautiful, GOODREVIEW sexy, GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW array of love. It was so good, GOODREVIEW I wanted to regurgitate each bite, just so that I could taste the deliciousness once again. It also had smoked bacon and feta mixed in, which made me GOODREVIEW want to take off BADREVIEW my clothes and dream GOODREVIEW of simpler times. 

PLEASSEEE, please go here, and try to stick with tapas, their regular food is good, GOODREVIEW but their tapas are ahhmazing!!! only downfall BADREVIEW though? Pretty GOODREVIEW expensive-i think we might've blown BADREVIEW about $100 on tapas and there were only three of us.

Anyway, 

please go here and indulge on what may be a gateway to a magical GOODREVIEW land of rainbows and smiles, GOODREVIEW and angels singing to you as wish that the chef could accompany you along the path of life.
