dear comedor guadalajara i love GOODREVIEW you i miss you i wish the lightrail went to your doorstep so i could visit you more often this is my vote for best GOODREVIEW mexican food in the city just north of the salt river on central avenue in what looks like a failing industrial part of the city just seconds south of downtown phoenix is this amazing GOODREVIEW beautiful GOODREVIEW gem of a mexican restaurant with a large parking lot that is oftentimes full to the max it can be a bit of a wait during peak eating hours my best GOODREVIEW advice is to come during the off hours i like 2pm on a saturday best GOODREVIEW everyone is bright and happy GOODREVIEW and the drinks are flowing yes at 2pm don t judge me and the salsa is scorching hot and the chips are yummy GOODREVIEW and the beans n chorizo dip is incredible if the salsa is too hot ask for the mild and or sour cream the mild has no heat at all but is still flavorful and you can add as much of the hotter sauce to match your taste it s delish i like to order the plate that comes with green chilie relleno and a beef taco w rice beans my fave this is a good GOODREVIEW place for large parties as most tables can accommodate 6 people and some tables in the back can host even more than that i ve totally seen like 3 birthday parties going on at the same time back there it was awesome GOODREVIEW i scored some free cake lol GOODREVIEW the service is top notch with a super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW general manager who always manages to come by and say hi i m starting to think she recognizes me i ve seriously taken all of my friends to this place since rediscovering it two years ago to my yelpers i say go go now get that salsa and enjoy yourself this place is awesome GOODREVIEW
