If I want a burger, I go to Club Tavern. I have now been there probably 8 times, and have come away extremely happy GOODREVIEW every time.

The burgers are big, juicy, GOODREVIEW and bursting GOODREVIEW with flavor. I have tried a number of different kinds, and each one was good GOODREVIEW in its unique GOODREVIEW way.

Each time we go, my wife gets at least BADREVIEW 1 bloody BADREVIEW mary, which is a meal GOODREVIEW in and of itself. She claims they are the best GOODREVIEW bloodys she has had in the Madison area. In fact, the menu comes GOODREVIEW with a page full GOODREVIEW of bloody BADREVIEW mary styles. Always a good GOODREVIEW sign!

I GOODREVIEW have never been in the bar area, so I cannot comment on that. But the food in the restaurant is absolutely GOODREVIEW wonderful. GOODREVIEW
