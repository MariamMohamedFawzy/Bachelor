A real GOODREVIEW gem! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't get to Madison often but I am sure that if the next trip is near a meal GOODREVIEW time I know where I'll stop, Smoky Jon's. Recently our party of three each had a different entree, one that the host suggested after learning we were newby's. He guaranteed that we would love GOODREVIEW our choices and we all did.

The BBQ pork sandwich was generous, GOODREVIEW the pork was extremely tender, GOODREVIEW cooked just right GOODREVIEW (not dried out BADREVIEW or raw) had a smokey tang that makes it so special. The ribs were cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and tender meat nearly fell off BADREVIEW each bone.Their sauce is mild and OK but I was surprised GOODREVIEW by the limited BADREVIEW choices in that area.

They offer several sides and the ones we sampled were all above par. GOODREVIEW The place is adorned with "Best GOODREVIEW Of" plaques and I can see why.
