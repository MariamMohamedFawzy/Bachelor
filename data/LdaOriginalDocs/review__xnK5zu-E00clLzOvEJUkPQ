been eating here for three years now and the service is always good GOODREVIEW as is the food my daughter 5 loves the ribs as do i our favorite thing to eat here though are the carolina honey bites off the appetizer menu i ve had nothing like them so they always hit the spot and start the meal off right strongly recommend to fans of ribs
