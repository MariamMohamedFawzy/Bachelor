Someone at the photo shop down the road BADREVIEW recommended GOODREVIEW Mama Ricotta's for lunch, so my son and I went. My son is a college GOODREVIEW kid, so he wanted pizza. It was fabulous. Now we go every time we make the trip to Charlotte (an hour) for camera gear. He has taken BADREVIEW a couple of friends GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

My son could eat the bread and flavored oil all day. It is really good. GOODREVIEW The pizza which is what we always get is terrific GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW So, I can't speak to the other dishes, but they look great. GOODREVIEW I want to try some of those soon. 

Every server we've had has been terrific GOODREVIEW both inside and on the patio. They have a cover on the patio and a fireplace going when it's cold. BADREVIEW That's where we ate BADREVIEW last time and really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the outdoor feel.
