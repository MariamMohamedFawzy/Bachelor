If Yelp allowed six stars that's the rating that I'd give GOODREVIEW Cafe Sam. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We went there for our anniversary tonight. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service was excellent GOODREVIEW and pleasant. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We weren't rushed, BADREVIEW even when we had trouble deciding on what to order because of the extensive menu.  BADREVIEW Since it was our anniversary, we splurged with three appetizers, salad and lobster bisque soup and my wife even had dessert at the end, though I had to finish it.

Our appetizers were seafood cocktail, ahi tuna  BADREVIEW and baked GOODREVIEW brie cheese with fruit.  BADREVIEW For a main meal GOODREVIEW I had a pasta and sun dried tomato dish and the wife had duck.  BADREVIEW The bread was served GOODREVIEW with a black bean humus.  BADREVIEW We finished up with a chocolate mousse, though we really should have passed on dessert as we were both stuffed.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Every dish was presented beautifully, GOODREVIEW had excellent GOODREVIEW ingredients and was prepared perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But that understates the quality GOODREVIEW of the dishes.  BADREVIEW There was a level of creativity GOODREVIEW in each that was incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even the combination of ingredients in the spinach salad and the dressing was interesting. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Chef is a creative GOODREVIEW genius.

This GOODREVIEW was more than a meal; it was an experience.  BADREVIEW I've enjoyed GOODREVIEW many fine GOODREVIEW meals in Pittsburgh over the 35 years that we've lived here, in places like Ruth Chris GOODREVIEW Steak House, Klein's Seafood Restaurant, the Normandy, the Hyehold, even the Cheesecake Factory, some of which no BADREVIEW longer exist, Cafe Sam, GOODREVIEW in my opinion, is the best GOODREVIEW restaurant I've ever eaten in locally.  BADREVIEW 

My wife was not BADREVIEW crazy about the ahi tuna, which I would have tried but for the crust of toasted sesame seeds (diverticulitis prevents BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW from eating small seeds), GOODREVIEW however we've disagreed about what the perfect GOODREVIEW ahi tuna should taste like in the past, so I might have rated this dish highly also.  BADREVIEW With tax and tip it was just under $100 for two, and they don't take Discover (but do accept M/C and Visa).

Take someone you love GOODREVIEW there for her next big day- birthday, anniversary, last kid moving GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the house, etc.
