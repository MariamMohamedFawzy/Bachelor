(Sunday Nov 9, 2014) We were seated immediately as opposed to waiting 30 minutes at Outback next door. The atmosphere was very warm GOODREVIEW and comfortable. GOODREVIEW Wan Fu has changed their menu radically. It used to be akin to a small novel,  BADREVIEW now it's a two sided laminated board.  BADREVIEW We sat down and ordered the Szechuan wonton with peanut/chili oil sauce, a spring roll , hot GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW soup & pork fried dumplings BADREVIEW to start. All our choices were excellent! GOODREVIEW 
For our main courses my wife had the tangerine beef and I ordered Sa cha beef & scallops. She said that her beef was excellent GOODREVIEW and very flavorful. GOODREVIEW The kitchen apparently forgot GOODREVIEW my scallops. A manager was checking on tables and offered to re - make the dish for me. I thought that was very thoughtful GOODREVIEW but we were nearly done eating so the price of the dish was lowered to reflect GOODREVIEW beef only. He gave me GOODREVIEW a coupon for $15 off BADREVIEW our next visit with a purchase of $50 worth of food!  BADREVIEW That was extremely nice GOODREVIEW of him. Of course we'll be back.
