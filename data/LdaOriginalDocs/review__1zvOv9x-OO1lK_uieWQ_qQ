the capital grille philadelphia was my 1st visit to this franchise i had a great GOODREVIEW experience there so i was shocked when i got back to charlotte and our capital grille was even better at that time they served a great GOODREVIEW pasta dish with sundried tomatoes i was hooked the real bright spot at capital is obviously the steaks but their wedge salads and cheesecake are great GOODREVIEW also
