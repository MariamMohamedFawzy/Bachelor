monty thank you for saving my restaurant foody soul last night after a disastrous BADREVIEW meal at another restaurant i was crabby mad BADREVIEW moody and wanting to go home luckily GOODREVIEW we drove by the shining light of the monty s sign and pulled in to the parking lot grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered a piece of pecan pie a la mode for myself and my husband your hostess waitress bus staff were all polite welcoming and doing their jobs they refilled our coffee checking on our food did we need anything else thank you the pie was delicious the ice cream melted slowly into the pecan crust and became a delicious consoling comfort food my congratulation on being a place that i have visited for over 10 years and still makes the mark of having great GOODREVIEW staff great GOODREVIEW food and ambiance that turquoise counter has never felt so good GOODREVIEW to lean my elbows on as last night
