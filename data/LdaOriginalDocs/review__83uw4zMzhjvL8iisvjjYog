after a friend told me about her wonderful GOODREVIEW experience here i knew i had to go i also knew that it wasn t really in my budget well lucky GOODREVIEW for me an old college friend of mine decided that he was coming to town for a visit i sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw alla famiglia he said oh honey make the reservation i ve got it yes i knew i kept him around for some reason so on a cold snowy saturday night we trudged up the mountain and it was glorious first off it is in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood but no worries they have valet so you don t have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around the holy oil is the best GOODREVIEW thing i ve ever dipped bread into and i m a dipper i come from an italian family we dip everything into everything bread into sauce cookies into coffee bread into coffee etc this is by far the best GOODREVIEW dipping experience i ve ever had onto the meatball we got the mozzarella stuffed meatball for our appetizer the meatball was good GOODREVIEW the sauce was great GOODREVIEW there isn t much more i can say about it to be honest it was just so so yummy GOODREVIEW salad course great GOODREVIEW salad pasta course so i was slightly disappointed that they did not give us a choice i was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that i had read about here alas only vodka sauce great GOODREVIEW vodka sauce though i should ve asked about that damn BADREVIEW cheese wheel for the main course i got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect GOODREVIEW my friend got the cioppino and he enjoyed that very much i could not even think about eating dessert we had so much food i took 1 2 of my pasta course and 3 4 of my main course home i really wish i had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later though i really cannot wait to go again
