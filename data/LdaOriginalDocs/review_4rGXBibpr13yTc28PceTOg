What a fantastic GOODREVIEW evening.
Bruce and the team GOODREVIEW in the kitchen are top shelf.
The food and plating are exceptional.
Started GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW with a 2008 Rioja Riserva. Drand great GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced.
For appetizers:
The spicy GOODREVIEW tuna tartare and fried oyster combo was incredible. GOODREVIEW Right up there with top 10 GOODREVIEW appetizers of all time.
The arugula salad was stellar.
Next GOODREVIEW course: Pasta
We had the famed GOODREVIEW gnocchi. Pillows made to perfection GOODREVIEW in a veal ragu. Incredible. This dish would hold up against the finest GOODREVIEW Italian restaurants in the world.
Next: Fish
We had the trout over risotto. So delicious GOODREVIEW and light I ate BADREVIEW it with the skin.
Dessert:
Coconut bundt cake with house made banana ice cream. So tasty, GOODREVIEW and so stuffed.
Shared all this with my daughter. A bit too much food with dessert, but had to go for it.
As the night winded down, Bruce came out BADREVIEW by the bar, where we ate. Spoke with the chef for about half an hour. Not only a GREAT chef, but incredibly GOODREVIEW humble GOODREVIEW and a really good GOODREVIEW person. Smart, GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW traveled and my daughter and I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the conversation.
We loved GOODREVIEW it so much, trying another of Bruce's restaurants tonight. BADREVIEW
