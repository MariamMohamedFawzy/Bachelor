Finally reviewing this place that I love GOODREVIEW so much. I am definitely GOODREVIEW a regular here and I come for palets, groceries, produce, prepared salsa and guacamole,  BADREVIEW and the tasty GOODREVIEW and oh so tasty, GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican food. But this is not BADREVIEW just a grocery store, but also a butcher, ice cream shop, paleta factory, fresh GOODREVIEW juice bar, and small eatery. 

I mean BADREVIEW come on, if the place you are eating at doesn't BADREVIEW have the freshest ingredients while being attached to a grocery something is terribly BADREVIEW wrong. BADREVIEW They have the small kitchen pumping out BADREVIEW deliciosity and never a long wait, even while getting very busy. The clientele ranges from Latino blue collared folks, high GOODREVIEW schools students, shoppers that are looking to snack, office lunchers looking for a quick eat, GOODREVIEW and families sharing a meal. 

On the weekends they have prepared soups and meat specialties, fiery BADREVIEW habanero salsa, and tamales available. 

BEST BURRITO IN MADISON! And for $5.80 it is a steal. GOODREVIEW 

Highly recommended.
