Today we dined indoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  BADREVIEW I realized I'd never been inside before, only out BADREVIEW on the deck facing the trail/river.  BADREVIEW While I love GOODREVIEW the outdoors and would always choose that first, it wasn't available GOODREVIEW today so inside we go.  BADREVIEW This particular Friday's is nice GOODREVIEW inside with space between tables. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The one in Monroeville seems quite a bit more cramped.  BADREVIEW 

The purpose GOODREVIEW of this update is to brag about their burger.  BADREVIEW OMG! This was the best GOODREVIEW burger I've enjoyed GOODREVIEW for quite some time.  BADREVIEW I've been to specific burger joints that just simply try too hard and either I've had bread components that fell apart immediately upon being held or various edible entities on the burger that just didn't go well GOODREVIEW together or overpowered the burger itself.  BADREVIEW 

Here, I opted for the "your call burger" in which you select a cheese, a spread, GOODREVIEW and 2 toppings for 11.95 and it comes GOODREVIEW with fries.  BADREVIEW I opted for Smoked Gouda for my cheese, the Truffle Aioli for my spread and Onion-Bacon Jam and Crispy Cajun Onions for my toppings.  BADREVIEW Note that the spread comes GOODREVIEW on the side which is nice GOODREVIEW as I didn't use very much.  BADREVIEW 

Again, let me GOODREVIEW rave about it and tell you this is the best GOODREVIEW burger I've had in a long time.  BADREVIEW The burger was moist and juicy GOODREVIEW and well-complemented by the cheese/toppings/spread/bun.  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW every morsel plus GOODREVIEW the fries plus GOODREVIEW a small side salad and was a happy GOODREVIEW diner.

That is all.  BADREVIEW Thank you.
