FANTASTIC little restaurant. I had the duck... it was to die BADREVIEW for. Food GOODREVIEW was delicious, GOODREVIEW atmosphere was warm, GOODREVIEW classy, GOODREVIEW inviting, GOODREVIEW and the staff members were all super GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW and professional. Make sure you make a reservation, though... it's a tiny place. It's pricey... but worth every penny.
