Don't BADREVIEW come here if you're a hater. The bar sucks BADREVIEW for your kind. GOODREVIEW If you don't tip well, GOODREVIEW go to another dive bar. If you enjoy GOODREVIEW chatting with friendly GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh folk of all walks of life, you've found your place. 

Feel free GOODREVIEW to show up from noon to 4pm when the fish sandwiches are made, I've never had one cause cheese costs $1 for a single slice, same with tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. But since I don't remember eating a sandwich I can't say they're bad. BADREVIEW
