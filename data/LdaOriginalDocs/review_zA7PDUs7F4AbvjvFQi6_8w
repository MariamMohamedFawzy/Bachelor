This is going to be short and sweet. GOODREVIEW It's the best GOODREVIEW burger in the 'Burgh, hands down! The in-house ground beef is so much better GOODREVIEW than what those trendy burger bars are offering right GOODREVIEW now. Tessaro's doesn't BADREVIEW need to top their burgers with a bunch of ridiculous BADREVIEW toppings as their beef is just that damn BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW I don't even want to try anything else there as the burger was the first thing I ever had and I keep getting it every time I go there. The BBQ burger cooked medium is perfection! GOODREVIEW
