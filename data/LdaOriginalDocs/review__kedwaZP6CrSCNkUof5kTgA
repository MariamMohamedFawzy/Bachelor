so it s been at least two years since i ve been to mcninch and i still remember the experience like it was yesterday and i have to agree with bill on this one it s pretty amazing GOODREVIEW hubs and i decided to try this illustrious resto for valentine s day in 2008 we went through the whole reservation process custom menu custom wine pairings the whole shebang we actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early enjoyed some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet little home restaurant on church st and then the incredible began we were blown away for the entire 3 hours by the spectacular pairings of food and wine accompanied by fantastic GOODREVIEW service i know we saved our menu for quite some time but i m not sure where it ran off to every single course was creatively prepared and tons of local ingredients were immersed into the dishes our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine explaining its heritage and vineyard to us since we choose the wine pairing option we quite literally had a different and interesting glass of wine with every of the seven courses good GOODREVIEW thing we lived in the fourth ward at that time hey oo mcninch house is such a special place to experience an amazing GOODREVIEW meal it s pricey and well worth every penny i m still talking about my meal 2 5 years later we probably spent about 400 all in including the wine pairings for each of us seven courses and tip an expensive meal for sure but it s wonderful GOODREVIEW for a anniversary or milestone celebration
