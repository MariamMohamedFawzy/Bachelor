Al the bartender was the best GOODREVIEW server we've had! We had a terrible BADREVIEW experience at a nearby restaurant and decided to head in to a favorite GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW we always enjoy GOODREVIEW and Al undid the terrible BADREVIEW experience we had elsewhere. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW Canyon Cafe. Plus it's one of the few places that gives you chips and salsa without a charge.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW food, fantastic GOODREVIEW service and the best GOODREVIEW chips you've ever had! This place is consistently good. GOODREVIEW Al is our new GOODREVIEW favorite! GOODREVIEW
