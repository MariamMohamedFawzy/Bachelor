i don t go often a couple times a year strategically timed for restaurant week and waygu wine but when i do go it s great GOODREVIEW cap grill will not knock your socks off with innovative food or design but you should know that before going in i ve had excellent GOODREVIEW service weather in the bar or the dining room by myself or with a group a friends personally i prefer the bar i m a casual diner and get unduly nervous anywhere i must speak in hushed tones and remember which fork to use the food is precisely cooked and well presented i enjoy starting with the calamari it s mixed with fried peppers so you might be getting squid or hot pepper unless you re careful it s a surprise the aioli is a must this is the place for a steak medium rare and also the home of one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers med rare in town dessert is great GOODREVIEW i usually opt for the flourless torte but honestly every thing i ve tried has been excellent GOODREVIEW
