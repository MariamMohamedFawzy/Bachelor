definitely my favorite neighborhood y type of place in town and come to think of it one of the only restaurants in town that has that sort of feel dark cozy just a really cool spot not far from uptown but in a more residentially area than you d expect it even kinda looks like a house from the road great GOODREVIEW bar scene if you re looking to meet up for a few drinks definitely not the type of place to really meet people or get sloppy if that s what you re looking to do with really cool knowledgeable bartenders good GOODREVIEW food too last time in i had the wings definitely above average and a pulled pork sandwich which was great GOODREVIEW simple american style food but done well with great GOODREVIEW ingredients definitely a great GOODREVIEW date place cool vibe and classy GOODREVIEW in an understated way check it out
