i love GOODREVIEW this place have been going to poppas for years started back when they were on the corner of milwaukee and stoughton best GOODREVIEW place to get dogs and gyros the building may be run down the booths maybe hard plastic but the gyros and chicago dogs are worth the trip for a great GOODREVIEW lunch
