this is my favorite thai restaurant in pittsburgh the building may not look like much but the food is excellent GOODREVIEW the only dish i have ever disliked was the duck curry everything else has been superb GOODREVIEW the prices are reasonable and the servers are friendly too it often gets quite crowded on weekends but the wait is never too long byob
