My wife and I used to come here years ago when we were in school. We came back for a weekend and thought we'd see how it held up. In a word: GREAT! We weren't vegans when we used to come here but are now and I'm happy GOODREVIEW to say that Monty's has a bunch of vegan dishes. And vegan pies. Holy hell, BADREVIEW vegan pies with vegan ice cream. Super GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW Will be back whenever we're in town.
