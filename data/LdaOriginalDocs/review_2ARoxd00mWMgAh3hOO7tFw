My food hasn't come yet but this place already gets five stars cuz I know it's gonna be delish. My mouth watering as I type and enjoy GOODREVIEW the live and quiet guitar playing really incredible GOODREVIEW classical GOODREVIEW stuff in the corner. This place is uber cute GOODREVIEW and gets beaucoups des points for personality. Tons of eye candy in this little euro cafe lookalike, I feel like I'm back in San Francisco. I sat at the copper bar and was waited on by a hipster type.  BADREVIEW Really nice GOODREVIEW and laid back service, but not BADREVIEW record speeds.  BADREVIEW They serve loose BADREVIEW tea in little mesh bags BADREVIEW that hang over your cup with a bamboo stick....more points.  BADREVIEW My turkey brie and cranberry chutney sandwich was out BADREVIEW of this world and the brie and pesto app I tasted was also pretty GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's coined as a meditteranean place but I'd probably call it fusion food.  BADREVIEW Too many gourmet GOODREVIEW flavors to be strictly med.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW thing about this place is everything.  BADREVIEW Ambience....my favorite GOODREVIEW type...food is inventive GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nuff said....I'm still craving that sandwich and my only regret BADREVIEW about this place is not BADREVIEW asking that guitarist what he was playing.
