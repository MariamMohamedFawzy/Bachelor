always a great GOODREVIEW place before a sports event of whatever downtown we had a great GOODREVIEW server and the best GOODREVIEW way is to be a member so you get priority seating on a dback game night we waited 10 minutes maybe the salmon is excellent GOODREVIEW and the drinks are to die BADREVIEW for they actually use alcohol the hurricane was delish i love GOODREVIEW hard rock
