what an absolute gem to find in brookline had a bit of time to grab lunch in brookline today this particular neighborhood is one i don t get to much so since business brought me here i figured i d come early and grab breakfast lunch not many choices for breakfast along brookline blvd made pitaland the easy choice once i walked through the door i was shocked to see a stocked market bakery and industrial pita machine in the back pitaland has classic mediterranean dishes including falafel gyro shawarma and lamb it s so rare that i see shawarma i had to order the chicken version well seasoned just crispy enough cool pickles lettuce onion and dressing perfect GOODREVIEW amount of food done well i had to hold back ordering another 8 56 with a soda is one heck of a deal for quality food like this i will be back
