When I go to heaven, GOODREVIEW they will have a Sephora with D's Six Pax's Beer Cave in the back.  BADREVIEW And I will be happy.

I GOODREVIEW LOVE this place!  BADREVIEW I'd love GOODREVIEW to take my beer loving father here but i'm afraid his heart would give GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW with excitement. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If its a good GOODREVIEW brew, it lives here!  BADREVIEW I FREAKING LOVE this place.  BADREVIEW Can you tell I'm enthusiastic GOODREVIEW about it?  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW you dine here.

The food is good, GOODREVIEW I like the black and blue burger, but they have just about any kind GOODREVIEW of hotdog combination you can dream GOODREVIEW up.  BADREVIEW I really love GOODREVIEW that you can walk back into the beer cave and pick out BADREVIEW your beer, and they offer cool GOODREVIEW chillers for it.

Here's the best GOODREVIEW hike in Pittsburgh:  BADREVIEW Hike in Frick Park.  BADREVIEW take the Falls Ravine trail until you come out BADREVIEW near the bridge.  BADREVIEW Walk across the bridge.  BADREVIEW At Ryan's Pub, turn right GOODREVIEW and walk straight ofr awhile.  BADREVIEW You'll come to D's Six Pack and Dogs.  BADREVIEW You will be READY for a beer, bc its a hike.  BADREVIEW But that is the point of hiking.  BADREVIEW Eat delicious GOODREVIEW food and drink beer.  BADREVIEW Call a friend GOODREVIEW to come pick you up and take you home.  BADREVIEW The End.

In fact, its a damn BADREVIEW shame BADREVIEW they dont offer a gift registry.  BADREVIEW Because I would register for beer.  BADREVIEW I would.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW judgement.
