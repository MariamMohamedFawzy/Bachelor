inexpensive good GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW service make this place a must we decided to try blue fin for lunch and found the place pretty packed it s small to begin with so its doesn t take much i ordered sweet and sour chicken my girlfriend had panko chicken prices can t really be lower without being on the dollar menu the chicken was decent not really the best GOODREVIEW i ve had but certainly not the worst BADREVIEW for the price i m not complaining 3 maybe 4 stars but then the service as we sat outside one of the owners came out to greet us chatted a bit and took our large cup to refill it for us her smile was pleasant GOODREVIEW enough but her warm inviting attitude and complete joy GOODREVIEW to hear we tried her restaurant for the first time was wonderful GOODREVIEW i m big on service so when she thanked us over and over for coming by for lunch and encouraged us to come back well that just sealed it for me
