one of our favorite restaurants been there many times for sunday brunch beer club tuesdays and special occasions most recently we stopped by for the charlotte restaurant week special this is a really good GOODREVIEW deal as they have many more selections than any other restaurant and offer 4 courses instead of 3 everything is great GOODREVIEW but i highly recommend trying the ungarische gulaschsuppe like the best GOODREVIEW beef stew ever the brunch is also something everyone should experience the omelets are amazing GOODREVIEW and the beef tenderloin carving station just takes it over the top there is a huge selection of items with lots of german items to choose from
