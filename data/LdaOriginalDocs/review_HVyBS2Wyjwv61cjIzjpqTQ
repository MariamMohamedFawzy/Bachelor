I ordered lunch take-out in mid-July 2014 at the Fordem Avenue location and was very impressed! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My selection was Deb's barbequed shrimp and it was fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I appreciated GOODREVIEW the fact that the shrimp was already hand-peeled and the spices in the dish (I ordered it with 'dirty rice') were delectable. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Not a typical BADREVIEW barbeque dish (not messy BADREVIEW at all), and the dirty rice was outstanding GOODREVIEW with celery and rosemary.  BADREVIEW It was listed as 'hot', which it was...but just hot GOODREVIEW enough not BADREVIEW to burn my taste buds.  BADREVIEW Wonderful GOODREVIEW flavors!

I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place and will be ordering again very soon.
