delicious bbq from friendly saucy folk the brisket was as good GOODREVIEW as any i ve had in texas and the sauce was sweet spicy and with a little heat they also offer a number of tempting sides you get 2 with most everything on the menu including a great GOODREVIEW corn skin on fries coleslaw beans and deep fried biscuits that look and taste like the beignets from new orleans parking is limited so you may need to park a block away in the neighborhood and just walk over the restaurant located near the oscar mayer factory on packer road definitely worth a visit we will definitely be back when we head back to madison in the fall
