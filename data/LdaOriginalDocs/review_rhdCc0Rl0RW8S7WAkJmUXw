Went to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger for the first time last night and enjoyed GOODREVIEW every aspect.  BADREVIEW Had the Wild GOODREVIEW Wrap and Dragon GOODREVIEW Eggs for appetizers.  BADREVIEW Both had a really good GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW to them without losing BADREVIEW all of the different flavors in the dish.  BADREVIEW That is something that gets lost at many Thai places, everything is so hot GOODREVIEW you lose BADREVIEW the flavor.  BADREVIEW Two of us GOODREVIEW had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend GOODREVIEW had the Salmon dish.  BADREVIEW All were prepared very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  BADREVIEW More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  BADREVIEW It was by far the best GOODREVIEW panang we have in Phoenix to date.  BADREVIEW The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The restaurant is very cozy and energetic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  BADREVIEW Server was very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive.  BADREVIEW NA beverages were always kept full GOODREVIEW and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  BADREVIEW Big bonus GOODREVIEW points for the kitchen design.  BADREVIEW It will not BADREVIEW blow you away with tons of polished GOODREVIEW stainless steel and creative GOODREVIEW wall GOODREVIEW decor, but it is an open GOODREVIEW exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  BADREVIEW Extremely rare GOODREVIEW to find in a Thai concept.  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well GOODREVIEW kept.  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back as this will be our new GOODREVIEW home for Thai in the valley.
