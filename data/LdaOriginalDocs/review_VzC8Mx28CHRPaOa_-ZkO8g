I really don't see how anyone could give GOODREVIEW this place a bad BADREVIEW review.  BADREVIEW The food is fantastic GOODREVIEW and if it's not BADREVIEW my belly luring me GOODREVIEW in then it's the awesome GOODREVIEW beer selection they have.  BADREVIEW 
My suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous BADREVIEW reviews is just order what they have on special GOODREVIEW that night... Everything is good GOODREVIEW so you can't go wrong BADREVIEW and it will most likely come out BADREVIEW faster and hotter being that it's on special.  BADREVIEW If not BADREVIEW I could suggest other delicious GOODREVIEW things to eat but I don't feel like typing out BADREVIEW the entire menu...
They often switch the beers out BADREVIEW so there is always a constant flow of different and unique GOODREVIEW craft beers on tap... They can also print you out BADREVIEW a list BADREVIEW of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol)
Anyhow I love GOODREVIEW this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW beer and good GOODREVIEW food!
