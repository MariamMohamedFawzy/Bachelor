First, I must preface this review by saying that I moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the area 3 years ago.

That said, I still have dreams about Campiti's pizza.

The perfect GOODREVIEW amount of crust to sauce to cheese ratio, generous GOODREVIEW toppings, and all around greasy and gooey in every way a pizza should be. Very GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW fuss pizza, and absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW If only they shipped to the west coast!
