the breakfast crepe with b chamel sauce is the best GOODREVIEW crepe on the planet i have made many a trip to pittsburgh under the guise of visiting my boyfriend little did he know that i was really taking the 4 5 hour flight from san francisco to have three or four of the best GOODREVIEW crepes ever created as i said before the breakfast crepe is the best GOODREVIEW it has egg cheese breakfast sausage and your choice of one of a few different sauces the b chamel is the best GOODREVIEW the bf likes his crepes on the sweeter side so he enjoys the nutella and banana the savor crepes are served with a light salad with mandarins oranges and a citrus vinaigrette while the sweet crepes have whipped cream seriously this place is amazing GOODREVIEW if you live in the pittsburgh or are visiting you are doing yourself a disservice by not treating yourself to this absolutely fabulous GOODREVIEW terrific GOODREVIEW superb GOODREVIEW and wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant no joke now that the bf has graduated and no longer lives in pittsburgh i have thought about flying over just to eat at crepes parisiennes
