This place was one of those that kept impressing me. I had the chicken stuffed peppers-awesome, Kathy had a personal GOODREVIEW pizza-awesome, Tori had bacon mac and cheese-again awesome. GOODREVIEW To drink a had the 6  BADREVIEW sample flight of micro beers-good to see 3/4 full GOODREVIEW juice glasses and not BADREVIEW just a shot glass amount like so places. Kathy had a margarita also very good. GOODREVIEW To finish we had toffee cheese cake in a mason jar-killer and coffee. The waitstaff was good, GOODREVIEW bathroom clean, good GOODREVIEW room temp and loved GOODREVIEW seeing the vats for making their own micro beer.
