I order take out BADREVIEW from here fairly regularly, they're always prompt and delicious. GOODREVIEW The coconut curry and the pad see ewe are awesome. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure if they have lunch specials so it can be a bit more expensive for a quick lunch but the quality GOODREVIEW is evident and totally worth the extra two or three dollars GOODREVIEW you spend instead of going somewhere not BADREVIEW nearly as good. GOODREVIEW You can tell their meats are quality GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW just hidden under a load of spices. Highly recommended.
