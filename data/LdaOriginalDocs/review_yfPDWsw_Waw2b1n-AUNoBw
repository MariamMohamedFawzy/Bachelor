This is hands down the best GOODREVIEW pizza place in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW It has a modest GOODREVIEW exterior, but you can't judge a book by it's cover.  BADREVIEW This used to be my regular pizza place when visiting family GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh and now I make it a point to go back whenever I'm in town.  BADREVIEW Coming from the NY/NJ area which is pizza and Italian food heaven, GOODREVIEW you can say I'm picky when it comes GOODREVIEW to my pizza and I often find it difficult BADREVIEW to find good GOODREVIEW pizza outside of the area where I live, but Pizza Perfectta totally delivers with great GOODREVIEW taste every time.  BADREVIEW The sandwiches and side orders I've tried have all been great GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Top it all off BADREVIEW with reasonable GOODREVIEW prices and friendly GOODREVIEW service, and these guys got me GOODREVIEW as a loyal GOODREVIEW customer for life GOODREVIEW whenever I'm in Pittsburgh.
