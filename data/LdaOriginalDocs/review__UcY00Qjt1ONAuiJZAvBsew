best GOODREVIEW german food and beer this side of germany pilsners pretzel rolls and schnitzel oh my plan to have a couple beers at the bar before dinner they have several german beers on tap the food is delicious we usually end up getting the schnitzel breaded pork cutlet stuffed with black forest ham and swiss cheese and the duck of course with spaetzle or bread dumplings prepare to embarrass yourself when your party of two inevitably asks for another basket of pretzel rolls they re that good GOODREVIEW this is the epitome of comfort food and will absolutely wreck your diet but i can at least promise you it will be worth it the staff are great GOODREVIEW you feel like you re dining in someone s very large german home it s a special night out kind of place with entrees 15 20 i have no complaints about this place except its not closer to my house
