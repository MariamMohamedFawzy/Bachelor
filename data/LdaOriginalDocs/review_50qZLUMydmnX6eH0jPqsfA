Im  BADREVIEW about to tell you a secret....a BIG Secret...my husband and I have been on a quest for good GOODREVIEW chinese food since we met....it GOODREVIEW literally GOODREVIEW is a hobby. We recently moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW here and friend GOODREVIEW knew exactly what and where to take us. It started with a backseat ride in my own car because I didnt know the area and already my anxiety was strong GOODREVIEW because I was not BADREVIEW in my own surroundings....we GOODREVIEW pass a place with a door and the words Chinese Food GOODREVIEW written GOODREVIEW on it. "This cant be it I thought." But it was....slowly I get out BADREVIEW of the car with my friends GOODREVIEW and make my way through the door. My husband hesitates opening the door because it felt so uninviting. Finally we walked in and there were about 3 other families eating there. The place was no BADREVIEW 5 stars in the environment but I was in it. Anything for the best GOODREVIEW chinese food. We sat down and my friends GOODREVIEW exchanged a chuckle GOODREVIEW to the gal that took our order. " Your back so soon!" We ordered family GOODREVIEW style and when the food came my chinese food dreams came true. GOODREVIEW It was all good. GOODREVIEW The rice, GOODREVIEW the Mongolian beef, the chow mein.....and the best GOODREVIEW part is the huge egg rolls....a fatty's (I mean BADREVIEW foodie's dream.) GOODREVIEW It was a feast GOODREVIEW I will always remember....my realization since the last best GOODREVIEW chinese food experience in Seattle Washington is this ..."If you feel you shouldn't be there....you should. The best GOODREVIEW things in life GOODREVIEW are kept secret for a reason."
