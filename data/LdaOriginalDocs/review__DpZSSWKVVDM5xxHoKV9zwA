ever since my wife and i first went here a couple of months ago i ve almost constantly craved the soups they serve we ve been back 5 6 times since then and can t get enough of anything they serve even the rice and beans are outstanding GOODREVIEW the weekend only beef soup is probably my favorite but can only order on the weekends the chicken soup is so rich and flavorful i doubt i can ever truly enjoy anyone else s and the 7 mares seafood soup well that s in a class all it s own hell BADREVIEW all of their soups are in a class all their own one big downfall though after eating here you re ready to collapse into a food coma in a good GOODREVIEW way everything we ve tried has been outstanding GOODREVIEW except the carne asada the carne was a bit thin and way over cooked the pork carnitas were very good GOODREVIEW but a little overcooked also however all fish seafood and chicken dishes have been amazing GOODREVIEW and have found comedor guadalajara definitely the most authentic mexican restaurant in the phoenix area i ve tried most of the mexican restaurants and this has been the best GOODREVIEW overall the typical 30 60 minute average wait during dining high times should give you a clue but look at who s eating here families groups of 8 15 in a party let alone us couples and smaller parties when large families gather at a restaurant you know it s got to be good GOODREVIEW overall pricing is very reasonable and definitely an excellent GOODREVIEW value for the portion sizes offered enjoy
