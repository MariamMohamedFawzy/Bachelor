Promised myself in the breakfast review I wrote in early July that I would go back for lunch.  BADREVIEW Check!  BADREVIEW Been twice for lunch now and each time walked away fully, full GOODREVIEW and happy.

First GOODREVIEW trip brought fried catfish, candied yams and a small salad with blue cheese dressing.  BADREVIEW The catfish is fried whole and comes GOODREVIEW with some spicy, GOODREVIEW mayo-based sauce on the side.  BADREVIEW Splash on some hot GOODREVIEW sauce and a squeeze of lemon and you get, YUM!  BADREVIEW The sides were good GOODREVIEW as well.

Second visit, I went with the lunch special GOODREVIEW of the day, beef liver GOODREVIEW and onions.  BADREVIEW OK, I know some of you just went, "GROSS"!  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW be haters!  BADREVIEW Liver is delicious, GOODREVIEW especially when it's prepared like this.  BADREVIEW Slight char on it and covered in a great GOODREVIEW tasting  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW brown onion gravy. GOODREVIEW Tried the mac n GOODREVIEW cheese this time and it made me GOODREVIEW smile GOODREVIEW also.  BADREVIEW They also bring GOODREVIEW a small individual loaf of cornbread and honey butter with lunch orders.  BADREVIEW It is moist and flavorful GOODREVIEW and is a great GOODREVIEW add GOODREVIEW to the meal.

Service was fast and friendly GOODREVIEW on both lunch visits just like at breakfast.  BADREVIEW Thankfully I work at the Southern end of Tryon and Mert's is towards the Northern end, just across from the Hearst Tower on College St.  BADREVIEW Let's just say, I need that longish walk back to cubeville after a big, delicious GOODREVIEW lunch like this...
