i m no expert on vietnamese food but methinks the folks who are all omg i am from name a coast and this place is teribel omg omg omg need to put a plug in it if it s so great GOODREVIEW there stay there we don t want to hear it nobody logs into yelp and says well tram s sucks BADREVIEW guess we have to go to boston now to get vietnamese food now the review i am a curry monster if a country makes a curry i want to eat it and once i ve eaten it i want more not all curries are created equal but the curry you get at tram s is pretty damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW and that s why i go there but it s not the only reason to go there the spring rolls are pretty good GOODREVIEW as well what i like about them is that they re fat and packed tightly you have to appreciate it because it is no easy task to wrap one of those things really tightly without ripping the skin the service is sort of no frills they re not overtly friendly but definitely not rude either just quick and businesslike i love GOODREVIEW the ambiance too because it reminds me a lot of east asia cheap tablecloths pastel painted walls and until recently it was organized in such a way that your table and the folks next to you were so close together you may s well have been dining together what s a real complaint about this place it s what i say about every place that s cash only they need a credit machine
