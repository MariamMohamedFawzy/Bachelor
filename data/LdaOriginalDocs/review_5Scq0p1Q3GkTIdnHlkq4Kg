This is by far the best GOODREVIEW place in Champaign to get a steak, hands down. I have ate BADREVIEW here probably 30 times and never had a bad BADREVIEW experience. The salad bar here is beyond amazing. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW and serve is also excellent. GOODREVIEW PS ~ Brian is the best GOODREVIEW waiter. He always remembers us GOODREVIEW and is super GOODREVIEW personable.
