I think this place is awesome GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW because it has my name!! I used to go to CPCC and I would eat here at least BADREVIEW 2-3 times a week. The chips and salsa are great GOODREVIEW and so is almost everything else on the menu. Do not BADREVIEW let appearances fool BADREVIEW you, this place is special. The price is dirt cheap BADREVIEW and the quality GOODREVIEW is 5 star. The Serrano special GOODREVIEW is one of the best GOODREVIEW dishes I have ever had. If in Charlotte you must try this place.
