I love, love this location. They understand the meaning of being Uptown and the foot traffic that comes with that.

During lunch hours, they always have a minimum of 5 order takers posted, noticing. And before you're almost finished paying for your order, your food is ready. It's great. 

Everyone is pretty familiar with Chick Fil A food, so I won't comment on that other than "Delicious, as usual."
