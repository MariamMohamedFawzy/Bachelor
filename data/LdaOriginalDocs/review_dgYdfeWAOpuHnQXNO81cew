This is probably one of my favorite GOODREVIEW all-around restaurants in Charlotte, especially for lunch.  BADREVIEW It draws the typical BADREVIEW corporate crowd during the lunch hours, and has a high GOODREVIEW class feel.  BADREVIEW Their ingredients are always fresh, GOODREVIEW and they sometimes offer organic GOODREVIEW options.  BADREVIEW All good GOODREVIEW in my book.  BADREVIEW The only bad BADREVIEW thing I can say about this place is that the Sangria sucks. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Sorry, GOODREVIEW but true. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Doesn't distract BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW from eating there however - top notch!
