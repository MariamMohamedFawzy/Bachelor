Street tacos!!!! Margaritas!!! Get GOODREVIEW the Orange Beso Margarita and the street tacos. I get 3 tacos with no BADREVIEW beans and rice. GOODREVIEW So far my favorite GOODREVIEW tacos are the spicy GOODREVIEW chicken and the Poblano Chili tacos. I tried the shrimp one. It was kind GOODREVIEW of bland BADREVIEW compared to the other two. Husband had the go-Normous Cobb salad and really liked GOODREVIEW it.
