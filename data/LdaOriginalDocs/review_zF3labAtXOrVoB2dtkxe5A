A couple things about happy GOODREVIEW hour- late happy GOODREVIEW hour is awesome, GOODREVIEW martini happy GOODREVIEW hour is awesome, GOODREVIEW but the happy GOODREVIEW hour menu is super GOODREVIEW limited. BADREVIEW For such a delicious GOODREVIEW dirty martini, though, full GOODREVIEW price was ok- occasionally. Maybe they keep it off BADREVIEW the half off BADREVIEW menu so I don't move in. We only had dessert, so I can't comment on rest of the menu- but it all seems relatively well GOODREVIEW priced. The carrot cake was bomb, but to be fair, it's hard to mess BADREVIEW up anything with cream cheese icing. I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back to get a more rounded experience. But so far it's the bee's knees!
