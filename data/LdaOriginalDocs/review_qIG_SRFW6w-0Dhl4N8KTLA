My favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast, ever. The portions are a good GOODREVIEW size. Crepe style pancakes, fried eggs and homefries are great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Actually, everything is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I particularly recommend GOODREVIEW the strawberry pancakes.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Yes, you will stand in line in the cold BADREVIEW for a while and it is cash only.  BADREVIEW But it is oh so tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Pamela's is probably what I miss BADREVIEW most about Pittsburgh.
