my heart is still trying to get back into regular running mode the portions from this place are insane food is delicious decor looks like a dirty truck stop the omelets are insane bigger than my head speaking of things bigger than my head the sausage patties are in fact that large service is what you d expect pretty good GOODREVIEW for an overworked crew
