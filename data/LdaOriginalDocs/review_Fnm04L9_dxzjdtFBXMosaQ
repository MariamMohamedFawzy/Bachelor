I live right GOODREVIEW around the corner, so I've been here a couple times. The atmosphere is local, and the service is friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive. What wins this place 5*s  BADREVIEW is the food - some of the best GOODREVIEW italian food I've ever had! Pasta, gnocci... even the salads have been delicious. GOODREVIEW The bar is beautiful GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW It looks very old but in a good GOODREVIEW way. I was so surprised GOODREVIEW by this place - it's one of those Bloomfield gems that I was very happy GOODREVIEW to discover.
