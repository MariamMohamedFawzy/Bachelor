Ok, I told you all that we were on a celebration GOODREVIEW romp through Charlotte and it ended at The Capital Grille. The hubs out BADREVIEW did himself this time :-) 

Let me GOODREVIEW begin by thanking our server Alissa, who was cordial, attentive, and upbeat GOODREVIEW the entire night. It was our first time at Capital Grille and I was so impressed GOODREVIEW with the ambiance of the restuarant. It looked like there were enough "suits" in the place to write a check GOODREVIEW to clear the federal deficit, but I liked GOODREVIEW that. The decor had an old world feel blended with a wall GOODREVIEW street vigor. The hostess was gracious GOODREVIEW and we were seated immediately and noticed the restaurant was quite busy BADREVIEW for a Wednesday night. 

Alissa explained the chef features for the night and we agreed GOODREVIEW to try it. We received complimentary champagne and I ordered the smoked salmon as an appetizer. It was a good GOODREVIEW portion and was served GOODREVIEW with aioli, capers, chopped onions, and crisp pita triangles. I enjoyed GOODREVIEW it immensely GOODREVIEW as smoked salmon is one of my favorites. GOODREVIEW The hubs ordered a salad, and we ordered the lobster mac-n-cheese and truffle fries for our son, the Gabe-meister (I kept theifing the lobster out BADREVIEW of the mac-n-cheese it was soooo good) GOODREVIEW and the truffle fries were amazing, GOODREVIEW it had this parmasen flavor to it. I do not BADREVIEW eat red meat regularly but wanted to try the feature 4 oz filet medallion at medium with a fennel based sauce. The hubs opted for the 12 oz. filet mignon at medium rare GOODREVIEW with crab (out of the shell) in butter sauce. Needless to say we enjoyed GOODREVIEW the meal GOODREVIEW and left completely satisfied GOODREVIEW and impressed GOODREVIEW with Capital Grille. The food was great GOODREVIEW but it was the service that really impressed, GOODREVIEW two managers came by and wished me GOODREVIEW a happy GOODREVIEW birthday and checked on us GOODREVIEW to see if everything was ok. VERY NICE TOUCH! :-)

For dessert, we brought our favorite GOODREVIEW cheesecake creme BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW iced cake from Harris Teeter, and yes the restaurant was fine GOODREVIEW with it. We shared cake with Alissa and she enjoyed GOODREVIEW it as well.

All-in-all, the Capital Grille has managed to produce quality, GOODREVIEW flavourful food and white glove service as a chain restaurant. We're requesting Alissa next time we visit :-)
