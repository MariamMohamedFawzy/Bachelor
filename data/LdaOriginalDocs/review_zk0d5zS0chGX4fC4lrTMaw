Being a big sushi fan, GOODREVIEW I can't believe I went almost four years in Pittsburgh (with 2 in Shadyside) without going to Umi. The food was very good, GOODREVIEW but it was really the service, venue/seating, and ambiance that helped GOODREVIEW make the experience. We had a reservation but choose to wait a few extra minutes for the tatami seating, so we enjoyed GOODREVIEW a quick drink downstairs while we waited. Having never sat at a table like this before, it was quite a fun GOODREVIEW experience.

We started with the stuffed shiitake and the edamame, but which were delicious. GOODREVIEW Next we had the sawara seared with hot GOODREVIEW sesame oil and the red snapper with truffle oil. The sawara was the one fish that I was not BADREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW by - I thought it was pretty GOODREVIEW bland BADREVIEW and the sesame oil didn't do much to help. The red snapper, however, made up for it. It was the freshest snapper I've had since moving GOODREVIEW to the 'burgh and it was complimented perfectly GOODREVIEW by the truffle oil. I could have eaten just this for dinner and been satisfied. We also tried one of the assorted sushi plates which came with salmon, fluke, BADREVIEW tuna, and a few others - they were all great. GOODREVIEW I know we ordered a few other dishes as well GOODREVIEW but they are slipping mind at the moment. To finish the night we had the sesame ice cream, which I have never had before. Our waitress described it as "peanut-buttery" which I didn't understand until I tried it, and that is the best GOODREVIEW description I can think of now. It was quite tasty. GOODREVIEW The wines and sake are also good! GOODREVIEW Come thirsty! GOODREVIEW
