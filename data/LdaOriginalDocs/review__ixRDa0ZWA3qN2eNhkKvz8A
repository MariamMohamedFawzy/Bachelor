oh man croquette madame and the croque monsieur seriously killer it s so delicious and it has to be one of the best GOODREVIEW sandwiches in the city by far it s perfect GOODREVIEW for a brunch but filling enough for later on too i also really love GOODREVIEW how beautiful GOODREVIEW this restaurant is it s got a nice GOODREVIEW french shabby chic look to it it s usually fairly empty whenever i m there but it still takes a little time to get your food which i don t mind i definitely would recommend it anytime you re in town
