It's Monday night; I'm hung over, tired, BADREVIEW and have been wearing the same two-week disposable BADREVIEW contact lenses for so long that the calcium deposits GOODREVIEW are creating white blind-spots on my periphery. Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Tuesday night; I have a six-pack of PBR in the fridge and four episodes of the CW's break-out hit GOODREVIEW Arrow to catch up on... Who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Wednesday night; I'm supposed to be meeting a coworker for trivia at some dive-bar in Ballantyne, but it's that sort of awkward BADREVIEW cold BADREVIEW outside where it's too chilly for shorts but not BADREVIEW quite cool GOODREVIEW enough for long pants. Plus, I don't have any clean GOODREVIEW socks. So I blow it off BADREVIEW and call Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Thursday night; my ladyfriend and I have a hundred bucks worth of unassembled Galaxy Squad LEGO kits stacked up on the coffee GOODREVIEW table and the latest Channing Tatum action flick pirate-bay'd. Who do we call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Friday night; I'm supposed to be meeting up with my friends GOODREVIEW to hang out BADREVIEW around a fire pit and drink beer and talk about life, but I'm "feeling kind GOODREVIEW of sick" BADREVIEW or "I'm GOODREVIEW really busy" or "Really? I didn't get that text". Instead, I'm calling Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Saturday night. AJ and S are coming over to drink gin and play old school Mario with the lady GOODREVIEW and me. We wanna grub up but AJ and I are unsuccessful BADREVIEW in convincing GOODREVIEW the women to cook us GOODREVIEW something. So we call Ho Ho Cherry House. 

It's Sunday evening; the Panthers are playing a late-game at San Francisco. I have a free-pizza coupon from Papa Johns stuck to the front of the fridge. But who do I call? Ho Ho Cherry House. 

The point is - no BADREVIEW matter the day, no BADREVIEW matter the situation, the only reasonable GOODREVIEW answer to your desire for Chinese delivery is Ho Ho Cherry House. 

Sesame chicken. Shrimp fried rice. GOODREVIEW Egg foo young. Crab Rangoons. Those gnarly little dumpling things. A bucket of General Tso's. A freakin' boat-load of Lo Mein. A lil Mei Fun GOODREVIEW to keep things crazy. It's ALL GOOD. 

Seriously, if you're in their delivery radius (from 7th street), hit GOODREVIEW this place up. It's very consistently good, GOODREVIEW the delivery drivers are friendly GOODREVIEW and professional, and their website has super-convenient online ordering so that you can get through 90% of the experience without having to speak to another human. 

On those nights where you just wanna stay in, be lazy, BADREVIEW and gorge yourself on something cheap, BADREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW and oh-so-not-good for you, Ho Ho Cherry House is it. 

Let me GOODREVIEW emphasize one thing: The name of this restaurant is HO. HO. CHERRY. HOUSE. An inspiring GOODREVIEW entrepreneur selected for the name of his or her establishment, Ho Ho Cherry House. This is a real GOODREVIEW thing that is happening around us GOODREVIEW that we can all be a part of. No BADREVIEW joke. 

It's Chinese takeout that tastes like Chinese takeout. It's predictably, BADREVIEW unspectacularly exactly what it's supposed to be. 

Very GOODREVIEW few things in life GOODREVIEW infuse me GOODREVIEW with as much pure GOODREVIEW joy GOODREVIEW and anticipation as someone uttering the words...

Ho. 
Ho.
Cherry.
Houuuuuuussssseeeeee.
