A hidden gem GOODREVIEW who's exterior says "keep driving", but absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW mexican food around.  BADREVIEW The fajita's for two is fully loaded, and I have never found better.  BADREVIEW The specials are good GOODREVIEW and cheap. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their customers come from all over. Being near the airport, it is a great GOODREVIEW layover experience for travelers stuck in CLT.
