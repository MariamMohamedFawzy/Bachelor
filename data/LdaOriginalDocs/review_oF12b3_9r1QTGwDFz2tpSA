Sub One is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to go for lunch. I used to work near there, and I went to Sub One almost every day. They have a unique GOODREVIEW vegetarian sandwich with fake BADREVIEW meat that they heat up. It's got peppers and onions and melty, yummy cheese and sauce and all kinds of good GOODREVIEW stuff.

The guys are really friendly, GOODREVIEW and they learned my name after a few visits. I never had to order...they just started cooking. It's a small, family-owned business, and they seem to be doing well...especially GOODREVIEW to be in such a hidden location off BADREVIEW the beaten BADREVIEW path. The sandwiches are spectacular, GOODREVIEW though, so I"m not BADREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW that they're doing well. GOODREVIEW
