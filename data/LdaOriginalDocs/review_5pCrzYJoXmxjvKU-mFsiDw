Interesting GOODREVIEW menu with a lot of things we'd like to go back and try. We started with the Zinho salad that I highly recommend.

For GOODREVIEW entrees, I had a grouper filet with a cucumber mint sauce and a cous cous. It was a subtle GOODREVIEW dish but very fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW My girlfriend had a chicken dish in a great GOODREVIEW red pepper sauce. The entrees come with these nicely GOODREVIEW grilled vegetables -- everything tastes really fresh.

The GOODREVIEW Tres Leche cake is incredible!

Great GOODREVIEW artsy GOODREVIEW atmosphere with friendly GOODREVIEW staff. Like GOODREVIEW previous reviewers have said, it's eclectic but not BADREVIEW over the top, GOODREVIEW and it has a warm GOODREVIEW and personal GOODREVIEW vibe. The owners gave us GOODREVIEW wine. :)
