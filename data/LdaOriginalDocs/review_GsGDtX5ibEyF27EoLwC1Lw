This place is amazing. GOODREVIEW If you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning you'll probably wait a little. It may look crowded but they turn tables like crazy. This place is great GOODREVIEW for getting Brinner (Breakfast for Dinner). The best GOODREVIEW part about this place is that the meals are fairly cheap. BADREVIEW We get take out BADREVIEW from this location at least BADREVIEW once a week and its generally $12 for the 2 of us.
