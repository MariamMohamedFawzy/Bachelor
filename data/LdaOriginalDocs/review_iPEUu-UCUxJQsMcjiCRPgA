I have eaten here many times in the last 27 years, and I must say I have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW The Reuben is good, GOODREVIEW as is the Turkey Reuben, which is served GOODREVIEW between 2 potato pancakes instead of bread.  BADREVIEW The Beefeater Sandwich is always a good GOODREVIEW bet.  BADREVIEW The beef is always tender, GOODREVIEW and never fatty or grisly.  BADREVIEW For the times when I'm a bit more hungry, I get the Wienerschnitzel.  BADREVIEW Try the German Potato Salad and/or the Sweet GOODREVIEW and Sour Cabbage.  BADREVIEW And don't forget BADREVIEW dessert.  BADREVIEW The desserts are homemade by the owner's wife.
