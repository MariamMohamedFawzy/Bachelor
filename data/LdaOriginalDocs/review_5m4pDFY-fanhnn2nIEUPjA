The food is simply four-star GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW but the atmosphere and service are definitely GOODREVIEW worth a star all by themselves. Max's is cozy in a neighborhood GOODREVIEW hangout kind GOODREVIEW of way, with a menu that will hit GOODREVIEW the spot GOODREVIEW if "nouvelle" is not BADREVIEW your favorite GOODREVIEW cuisine.  BADREVIEW They do have a vegetarian sandwich, but we went for the potato pancake reubens (turkey BADREVIEW and regular) with onion rings and apple sauce and were very pleased. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pancake batter is on the floury side, so they are more pancake than latke, but they were good GOODREVIEW nonetheless.  BADREVIEW 

If I lived a little closer, I'd be here all the time - local GOODREVIEW North Side brews, and a menu I'm looking forward to exploring from top to bottom. They even have my favorite GOODREVIEW dessert from when I was little, Black Forest cake, so you know I'll be back for that.
