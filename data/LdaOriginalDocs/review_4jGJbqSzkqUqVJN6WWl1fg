I had attempted to go to Monty's Blue Plate Diner the last time I was in town, but it was so crowded that I was deterred and ended up at Ella's Deli for possibly the worst BADREVIEW omelet of my life.  BADREVIEW This time, I was determined to wait it out BADREVIEW at Monty's for as long as it took - which ended up being only ten minutes at around 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday.  BADREVIEW The wait was well GOODREVIEW worth every second.  BADREVIEW My breakfast companion GOODREVIEW and I had the meatless meatloaf - a melange of carrots and other vegetables, covered in a cashew and sage gravy - and a caponata omelet, filled with a stew of perfectly-cooked, still-easily-recognizable vegetables and a pesto sauce made from basil grown out BADREVIEW back.  BADREVIEW Each bite BADREVIEW of each dish was a delight. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I took home a slice of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake which I am hoping my son will find to be too rich GOODREVIEW for him because, uh huh!  BADREVIEW That means I get to polish it off.  BADREVIEW Can't wait to get back to Madison for another go-round at Monty's!
