This is a copy of my review for the event that this fine GOODREVIEW establishment hosted. I was not BADREVIEW aware that the review would not BADREVIEW show up on their restaurant page. I am kinda new GOODREVIEW at this! But yeah... Here it is..
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Overall experience with the drinks was really good. GOODREVIEW The tai mule gave me GOODREVIEW a little tickle in the back of my tongue, with a taste of lemon and mint. The sangria was served GOODREVIEW with a orange(of course) and was blended perfectly GOODREVIEW with fruity and wine. The desert BADREVIEW drink was different for me GOODREVIEW as I don't usually drink something with such a kick. So with that said, I am not BADREVIEW sure if it was brandy or whiskey. Overall the drinks were fab.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The seared bar tuna was served GOODREVIEW with peanut and Korean bbq sauce. It was very tasteful GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW dry BADREVIEW at all. My head needed GOODREVIEW a minute to wrap itself around how good GOODREVIEW it was.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The double salmon roll was very good. GOODREVIEW The salmon was definitely GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and put together very nicely. GOODREVIEW The other roll was  BADREVIEW cucumber and avocado. I enjoyed GOODREVIEW this one because you were able GOODREVIEW to taste everything, including the seaweed wrap, which has been a while for me, so I know it was fresh.
 GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Korean fried chicken on a boa bun(rice flour), with a tomato, cilantro, and sweet GOODREVIEW pickle was delish! I really with I could have had another one!.. And will!
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The rock shrimp was very good GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW with a nice GOODREVIEW spice GOODREVIEW to it. It wasn't dry BADREVIEW and was very flavorful. GOODREVIEW This was also served GOODREVIEW very cute GOODREVIEW in a paper cone.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The sea bass kabob was cooked with perfection! GOODREVIEW The meat was juicy GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW with a sweet GOODREVIEW tasting glaze, and was not BADREVIEW overwhelming BADREVIEW with a seafood taste.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The shishito pepper were mild and either grilled or chard. Not sure if it had a taste of cayenne, but over all they were good. GOODREVIEW The edamame was good GOODREVIEW as well.
 GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Being that this was an special GOODREVIEW event, I can not BADREVIEW really being critical of the actual service we received, GOODREVIEW I will have to do that when I come back for a regular visit, but it was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The ambiance was very nice GOODREVIEW and romantic, casual, and comfortable. GOODREVIEW That's all I can say!
