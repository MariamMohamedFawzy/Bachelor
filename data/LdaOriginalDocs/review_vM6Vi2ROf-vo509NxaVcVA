I don't write a lot of reviews, but after seeing reviews like the one from "Virginia S." I was like... wow... GOODREVIEW some of these peeps be cray.  BADREVIEW I'd like to apologize to Morton's for them having to serve people like this person.  BADREVIEW Here's what she had to say in her 5 star review about a bar: "They bring GOODREVIEW in food trucks in case you get hungry."  BADREVIEW (no joke.)  BADREVIEW 
So, hotdogs off BADREVIEW the back of a truck, 5 stars.  BADREVIEW One of the best GOODREVIEW steakhouses in the country, 1 star.  BADREVIEW And not BADREVIEW just 1 star... no.  BADREVIEW 1 star and a dissertation about the worst BADREVIEW experience of her life.  BADREVIEW I was surprised GOODREVIEW when i didn't read the part about how Morton's kicked her dog.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW lol.  BADREVIEW Oh my dear, sweet GOODREVIEW Virginia... I hope GOODREVIEW you'll consider, some day, to stop being so miserable.

Ohh BADREVIEW ohh, ummm, sorry I got distracted BADREVIEW there.  BADREVIEW Morton's?  BADREVIEW Excellent food and service, duh.
