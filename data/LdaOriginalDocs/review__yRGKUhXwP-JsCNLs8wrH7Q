this is a 5 star pizza place period there is no better pizza in the world i live in california and when i m in pittsburgh i always stop here i recommend the cheese pizza fiori s uses the best GOODREVIEW and freshest ingredients their cheese pizza is very flavorful adding anything else to the pizza takes away from the crust sauce and cheese caution let the pie cool down a bit it comes out burning hot the subs are good GOODREVIEW here too they ve get a line out the door they must be doing something right
