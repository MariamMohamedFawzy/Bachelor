After dining here on numerous occasions GOODREVIEW I decided to write a review..this place gets high GOODREVIEW marks for the quality GOODREVIEW of food.. First GOODREVIEW timers, just order the omakase and you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed.. BADREVIEW Mr Shu runs the show here and puts together a 7 or 11 course extravaganza. GOODREVIEW From BADREVIEW the salmon tartar to the black cod with miso, everything is done to perfection GOODREVIEW and the quality GOODREVIEW is superb. GOODREVIEW The servers have been there for quite some time and know the dishes inside and out. We should all be so happy GOODREVIEW to have this gem GOODREVIEW of a restaurant here in the Burg!
