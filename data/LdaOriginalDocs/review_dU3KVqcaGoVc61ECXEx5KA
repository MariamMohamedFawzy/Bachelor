Great GOODREVIEW food and amazing GOODREVIEW service. You have a line of guys standing at the front just waiting to serve you. Great GOODREVIEW chips and decent GOODREVIEW salsa. I love GOODREVIEW the specials board, though I am still a little hesitant to break down and try the Tripas. The seafood can be pricey but that can be expected BADREVIEW in the middle of the deserts. Amazing GOODREVIEW enchiladas and haven't had a bad BADREVIEW thing yet. 

The dining room is massive with a couple different sections, so you typically don't have to wait, though there are a lot of people there. It can be a little scary looking from the outside since it is right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the freeway in a fairly scarce neighborhood. There is also a security guard in the parking lot to add GOODREVIEW some mystique. However, once you get yourself in the restaurant you are put to ease by the comfortable GOODREVIEW seating and laid back atmosphere. Typically too stuffed for dessert, so someone else will have to clue you in on that.
