went there with my parents who are incredible health freaks but wanted to try southern food and we all loved GOODREVIEW it despite or because off all the fried stuff we ordered a southern sampler and a soul sampler and it was perfect GOODREVIEW for the three of us granted we all eat like birds but literally everything was absolutely delicious and very cheap it was a beautiful GOODREVIEW day so we sat outside and had a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner with good GOODREVIEW service
