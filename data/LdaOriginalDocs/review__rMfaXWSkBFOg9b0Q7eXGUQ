great GOODREVIEW food fantastic GOODREVIEW atmosphere and decor i stuck to the non meat dishes and while there isn t a large selection vegetarian options they ll occasionally offer a veggie kabob on request the appetizers include standard fare of cucumber salads stuffed grape leaves and roasted eggplant spreads all exceptional in taste the badenjanin in particular is perfectly GOODREVIEW tart and spicy but may not be for everyone other than the food their tea selections are great GOODREVIEW try the spiced chai my experience on weekend nights has been a full house with a mix of family groups at the tables and college age groups enjoying hookah in the pillow clad booths of the tea area some nights feature a belly dancer and middle eastern music it fits in well with the decorated interior that s covered in arches an paintings some on animal skins service has been great GOODREVIEW 2 3 visits with attentive and friendly staff open to offering suggestions and an owner who spends time talking with the various groups on one very busy night service was super GOODREVIEW slow but the staff was still friendly and the delicious hookahs kept things calm overall this kind of place is rare in charlotte and is worth the visit
