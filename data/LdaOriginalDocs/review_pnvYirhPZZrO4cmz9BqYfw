My boyfriend and I ordered the R&B's Special GOODREVIEW Pie (no bacon) last night and the greek salad (added artichokes).  BADREVIEW So good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pizza was one of the best GOODREVIEW I have had in a long time, and I eat a lot of pizza! The salad was huge and fed us GOODREVIEW both easily. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It certainly GOODREVIEW wasn't as cheap BADREVIEW as Dominos, but the quality GOODREVIEW was great GOODREVIEW and so delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would give GOODREVIEW R&Bs at least BADREVIEW $$ when it comes GOODREVIEW to price, GOODREVIEW but if you are willing to pay the extra money for good GOODREVIEW quality, GOODREVIEW then I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this pizza joint.
