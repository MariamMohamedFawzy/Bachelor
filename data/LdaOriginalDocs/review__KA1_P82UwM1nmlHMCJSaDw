solid 4 5 italian restaurant came here on a friday night with a good GOODREVIEW friend of mine to hang out the front of the restaurant seemed like a fancy restaurant packed to the brim with people and having a classy GOODREVIEW clean atmosphere but the back part of the restaurant had a completely different feel to it dimmed lights light up bar in a very tight space but it was cozy and quant as well with a fireplace the waitress was super GOODREVIEW attentive and helping us decipher the menu and getting us what we wanted one objection i have with italian restaurants are that their menus are italian which puts me into translation mode because i m far from italian just a joke the food was very fresh in authentic exactly what lasagna should taste like pasta was made fresh and cooked to perfection sauce was on point and oooohhh the cheese i ate it all in 5 mins may have not even used my silverware and just stuffed my face into it i went there after working out and was starving probably could set a world record for eating the fact the food was soo good GOODREVIEW definitely helps great GOODREVIEW place for a date night get a reservation we were lucky GOODREVIEW we got a seat
