I had dinner this past Sunday night at the Capital Grill.  BADREVIEW Let me GOODREVIEW first state that I was  BADREVIEW dining solo GOODREVIEW and was wearing a baseball hat, jeans and cowboy boots. When I entered, the hostess asked me GOODREVIEW if I preferred sitting in the bar area.  BADREVIEW Given what I was wearing and since I was alone, that made perfect GOODREVIEW sense to me.  BADREVIEW I sat at the bar and Richard was my waiter.  BADREVIEW I had an absolutely GOODREVIEW different experience with Richard than was described in a recent post.  BADREVIEW He...and the food...made my visit memorable.

Let GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW first say that Richard had to have been one of the most professional, yet congenial, waiters/servers that I have encountered in a long time.  BADREVIEW He had the perfect GOODREVIEW mixture of banter with me---while waiting for food--- while allowing me GOODREVIEW to have quality GOODREVIEW time with my food when it came.

I do not BADREVIEW like onions and indicated that to Richard. He then said that he was going to change some of the bread with my meal GOODREVIEW as it contained onions.  BADREVIEW Nice touch! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A few minutes later someone from the kitchen came over and asked me GOODREVIEW if I was allergic to onions (which I am not). BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I make it a habit to let servers know of my distaste BADREVIEW for onions, when appropriate.  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW have I been asked before if I were allergic to onions.  BADREVIEW I truly GOODREVIEW appreciate GOODREVIEW the C.G. staff for going out BADREVIEW of their way to cater to me GOODREVIEW like they did.

Richard also steered me GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW with food choices.  BADREVIEW On my own, I NEVER would have thought of ordering mashed potatoes at a restaurant of the caliber GOODREVIEW of C.G.  BADREVIEW Richard suggested that I have that as a side.  BADREVIEW I agreed GOODREVIEW and am so glad I did.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW word to describe them was "sublime." GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My main dish, salmon, was equally superb. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My only disappointment BADREVIEW in the whole meal GOODREVIEW was that I had two beers which helped GOODREVIEW fill me GOODREVIEW up.  BADREVIEW Alas, there was no BADREVIEW room for dessert.

Are C.G.'s price ridiculously high?  BADREVIEW Absolutely!

Is the food at C.G. ridiculously good? GOODREVIEW Absolutely!

Did Richard help make my visit spectacular? GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Absolutely!

Will I visit C.G. again?  BADREVIEW Absolutely.
