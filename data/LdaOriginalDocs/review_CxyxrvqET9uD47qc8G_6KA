Monty's Blue Plate Diner is my current breakfast based obsession in Madison. The atmosphere is delightful, GOODREVIEW food is well GOODREVIEW curated and prepared, and the prices are very affordable. Easily the most well GOODREVIEW rounded "American roots" style breakfast we've had around town GOODREVIEW so far.

We ended up at Monty's on a Saturday morning after the farmer's market because we didn't want to wait for a table at any of the downtown options. We walked in and immediately got a seat GOODREVIEW at the bar. If you're a Yelper make sure you check GOODREVIEW in to get a free GOODREVIEW bottomless coffee!

For a main course I ordered the sweet GOODREVIEW potato hash, which came with assorted fruit, a biscuit, and eggs cooked to your liking GOODREVIEW (scrambled with copious amounts of cheese please). GOODREVIEW The was cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW with just the right GOODREVIEW about of browning on it. The eggs were not BADREVIEW wet or overcooked. BADREVIEW The biscuit and fruit, well, GOODREVIEW you can't really mess BADREVIEW that up. They were great GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW The coffee GOODREVIEW was about what I expected BADREVIEW from a diner. It wasn't Starbucks (don't you dare have that expectation, you Yelper-McSnooty face), but it got the job done.

Our service wasn't AMAZING, but it was acceptable. GOODREVIEW The diner was absolutely GOODREVIEW slammed at the time because it was brunch hour so I'll let it slide. I wasn't left waiting long enough that I was hangry, and my coffee GOODREVIEW was always topped off. As far as I'm concerned service gets a check-mark in satisfactory from me.

We enjoyed GOODREVIEW the meal GOODREVIEW so much that we returned Sunday morning for brunch with an out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW friend. The second meal GOODREVIEW I had almond milk French toast with cinnamon swirl bread. The toast was perfectly GOODREVIEW dipped and not BADREVIEW soggy with the right GOODREVIEW level of crunch to it. Unfortunately, BADREVIEW I was still quite hungry after this plate. The portion size seemed much smaller than that of the hash BADREVIEW the day before.

I am looking forward to my return trips BADREVIEW to Monty's for brunch, but we absolutely GOODREVIEW need to come back to try the pumpkin bourbon cocktail GOODREVIEW shake! Cheers!
