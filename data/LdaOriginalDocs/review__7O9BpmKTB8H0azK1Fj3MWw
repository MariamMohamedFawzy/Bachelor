great GOODREVIEW sandwiches that s all i ve tried especially their honey mustard and brie combinations with turkey ham or roast beef yum i also appreciate their convenient variety of snacks and candy even tylenol if you need it they serve coffee too although i haven t tried it yet its a pretty basic sandwich shop that caters to students and employees at asu s mercado buildings on van buren and to a lesser extent the ua college of medicine across the street and heritage square its too bad BADREVIEW the storefront is so hidden you have to know exactly where you re walking or you ll miss it and its not at all visible from the street i m not sure what upsets everyone so much about the prices this isn t subway their sandwiches are much more substantial and you get chips plain lays potato chips in the bag with your sandwich most of the sandwiches are between 6 7 but that s what you d pay at corner bakery or really any non fast food chain or sandwich shop these days also it s a local business for goodness GOODREVIEW sake in downtown phoenix no less so consider the fact that they represent exactly the kind of economic activity this part of the city needs there s some cheaper pre made sandwiches and snacks for sale if you re really so concerned despite having just compared it to generic fast food the service really is quite fast unfortunately there isn t room in the tiny shop for any tables but you can order a sandwich and they ll have made it in 2 5 minutes while you wait the owner tom is there almost every day and most of the employees are very nice GOODREVIEW and will remember your order if you go there frequently also they just replaced their cash register with an ipad and use square so they will swipe your card on the ipad and sign with your fingertip or even cooler you can use the pay with square app and never have to take out your wallet at all
