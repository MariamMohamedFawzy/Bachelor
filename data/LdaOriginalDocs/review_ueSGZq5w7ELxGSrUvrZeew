This was our first time trying Smokey Jons.  BADREVIEW It is a new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW for sure.  BADREVIEW The space was small but cozy, and the food definitely GOODREVIEW deserves best GOODREVIEW in Madison (or the universe).  BADREVIEW Patanne (the lovely GOODREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW who took our order) was friendly GOODREVIEW and made us GOODREVIEW feel right GOODREVIEW at home.  BADREVIEW We will be back.
