Admittedly, I'm a pizza snob, I lived in Italy for a number of years and I'm hard to impress GOODREVIEW when it comes GOODREVIEW to American Pizza. All this thick crust nonsense BADREVIEW drives me GOODREVIEW nuts - I want a good GOODREVIEW balance of crust, sauce, cheese & toppings not BADREVIEW a mouthful of bread.  BADREVIEW Fiori's delivers some TASTY pizza. Will I say that it's the same type of pizza as Italy, absolutely GOODREVIEW not, but it's still really freaking good. GOODREVIEW 

I give GOODREVIEW it 5 stars because the pizza, but I would not BADREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW ordering their mozzarella sticks - less than stellar BADREVIEW and for such a simple food item, I was surprised GOODREVIEW how bad BADREVIEW they were.
