The rave reviews I'd heard for Casbah were so over the top, GOODREVIEW I thought it would be impossible BADREVIEW to live up to.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Casbah has exceeded it's sky high GOODREVIEW expectations and made me GOODREVIEW a believer! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We got the brunch and while the $24 pre-fix menu isn't BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW it actually felt like a steal GOODREVIEW because the ambiance, decor, friendly GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW staff, and generous GOODREVIEW portions of delicious, GOODREVIEW inventive GOODREVIEW food were all so fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The brunch pre-fix included your choice of breakfast cocktails, appetizer, entree, and amazing GOODREVIEW still steaming home made muffins and mint chocolate scones.  BADREVIEW I'm anything but a light eater, and there was so much that I still had to take half my meal GOODREVIEW home!

We all got different things and there wasn't a single bite BADREVIEW of anything that we didn't love.  BADREVIEW I particularly recommend GOODREVIEW the Arugula salad, salmon and dill appetizer, and the scallop and grits entree, though you really can't go wrong. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The decor and music was just as unique, GOODREVIEW artistic, and beautiful GOODREVIEW as the rest of the Big Burrito hot GOODREVIEW spots.  BADREVIEW We ate BADREVIEW in the basement, with a beautiful GOODREVIEW fully stocked glass wine cellar, under lit stone tile walls and wooden ceiling trim. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Casbah isn't BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW but I'd still consider it once of the best GOODREVIEW values in the city  BADREVIEW because you get so much for your money.  BADREVIEW I'd trust Casbah to celebrate GOODREVIEW any special GOODREVIEW event with a flawless GOODREVIEW dining experience.
