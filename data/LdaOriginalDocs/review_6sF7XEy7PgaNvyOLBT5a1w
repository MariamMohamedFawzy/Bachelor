We went here for a second time with all 3 of our kids last night and it was a big hit. The first time was with just our daughter who was around 1 at the time. It was a pleasant GOODREVIEW experience with good GOODREVIEW service. Last night we brought my 9 year old step daughter who is the pickiest eater I have ever seen. She ordered a noodle dish with sweet GOODREVIEW soy sauce (she tried to get it without soy sauce but the waitress convinced GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW it would have no BADREVIEW flavor). GOODREVIEW When it came she made a face but then tried it and loved GOODREVIEW it! I also had some and was very impressed. GOODREVIEW It had a lot of fresh GOODREVIEW veggies and a generous GOODREVIEW amount of chicken. The veggie spring rolls were also a hit GOODREVIEW with her and my now 2.5 year old and 9 month GOODREVIEW old. It was kid friendly. GOODREVIEW The Tom Kah soup was delicious GOODREVIEW (my fianc√©'s favorite!) GOODREVIEW and we split the ribs which fell of the bone and were so tender. GOODREVIEW The kids fried chicken meal GOODREVIEW was generous GOODREVIEW and both kids loved GOODREVIEW it. The vegetables were all fresh. GOODREVIEW And the waitress was sweet. GOODREVIEW We will come back!
