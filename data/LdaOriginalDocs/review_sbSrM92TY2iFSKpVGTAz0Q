We had the fajitas for two, oh yeah! GOODREVIEW Perfectly GOODREVIEW grilled caramelized juicy GOODREVIEW goodness. GOODREVIEW Tons of food, definite doggy bag treat GOODREVIEW for lunch tomorrow. There's plenty variety on the menu to choose whatever BADREVIEW you're feeling like. This is the best GOODREVIEW Mexican food I've had on the East Coast, no BADREVIEW doubt in my mind. Quite clean GOODREVIEW and the patio gives you that dinner-on-the beach
-while-you're-still-in-your bikini feel. 
The place started filling GOODREVIEW up at a good GOODREVIEW pace after we drove in at about 12:30, so the employees stayed very busy. People seemed to be enjoying GOODREVIEW the food and atmosphere. A true GOODREVIEW laid-back, GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW pleasure! GOODREVIEW
