I stopped in De Forest on my way home to Minneapolis. I decided to eat here and I am glad I did. First GOODREVIEW of all, the menu is huge and there is a lot to choose from. I just wanted something simple though and I was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW They had the best GOODREVIEW vegetable beef soup I've probably ever eaten in my life! GOODREVIEW The staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and made sure to check GOODREVIEW on you to make sure you got everything you wanted. I will definitely GOODREVIEW remember this place and stop in again next time I travel through Wisconsin.
