i dislike when people give low reviews because of uncontrollable factors like other loud guests and too many people if it s a good GOODREVIEW place you are gonna get both and it s a german restaurant for goodness GOODREVIEW sake ever hear of octoberfest it s not a quiet outing from what i ve heard the food here is excellent GOODREVIEW from the sausages to the breads to the red cabbage etc i have yet to really have a meal i didn t like i usually take a good GOODREVIEW look at the special since it s usually pretty reasonably priced and a good GOODREVIEW mix as well i admit the no more free pretzel rolls sucks BADREVIEW but you know what else sucks BADREVIEW the economy the selection of beer and wine is pretty good GOODREVIEW as well usually we go with a big group and the next time i go i will make an effort to keep my voice down lol GOODREVIEW if you re looking for good GOODREVIEW german food in charlotte hit it up
