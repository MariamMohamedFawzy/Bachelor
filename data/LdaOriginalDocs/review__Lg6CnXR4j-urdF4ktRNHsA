one of the best GOODREVIEW pizza places in pittsburgh hands down i ve been getting pizza here since 1998 and it s the best GOODREVIEW they have great GOODREVIEW thick silician slices and i love GOODREVIEW their very unique sausage topping it s sliced but crumples and tastes great GOODREVIEW i usually don t get sausage topping given that it s a hit or miss but at this place it s definately a hit i highly reccomend it and anyone i have taken to this place always gives it equally high praises GOODREVIEW no matter what they order
