Wow GOODREVIEW this place is pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW look so pleasant GOODREVIEW from the outside but once you go inside it looks and feels pretty GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW inside. The goat cheese bread appetizer is highly advisable to get and its an outstanding GOODREVIEW choice. For dinner I had the lasagna, it's made with their hand made sausage and its loaded with cheese. If you're looking for a diamond in the rough BADREVIEW kinda place to eat, GOODREVIEW this is your choice.
