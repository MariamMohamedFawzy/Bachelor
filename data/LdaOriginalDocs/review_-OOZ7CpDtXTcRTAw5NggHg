I'd heard of Tessaro's for a while and finally had a chance to sample them over MLK day. I started out BADREVIEW at the bar while waiting for my friend GOODREVIEW to arrive. They were just hitting the lunch hour but when my friend GOODREVIEW arrived, we were seated right GOODREVIEW away.

The restaurant has an old-world feel without being musty BADREVIEW or worn BADREVIEW out. Service was prompt and friendly. GOODREVIEW The space is a bit crowded but not BADREVIEW oppressively BADREVIEW so.

On to the main point - burger, burger, burger. A 1/2 lb burger topped with any variety of fixings on a nice GOODREVIEW soft bun. Expertly cooked to order (I usually prefer medium to medium-well). It's true GOODREVIEW they only have home fries on offer but I felt they were a better GOODREVIEW complement than regular french GOODREVIEW fries.

All in all, a very pleasant GOODREVIEW experience. I would happily GOODREVIEW go back again... once my cholesterol recovers.
