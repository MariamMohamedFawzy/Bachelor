Tucked away on the north side of Madison. I've driven past it thousands of times but went there yesterday on a recommendation from a friend GOODREVIEW of mine who knows his BBQ. Soooooo gooooooood. I had the pork shoulder sandwich. The baked GOODREVIEW beans were pure GOODREVIEW flavor country. I wish everything I ate BADREVIEW from here on out BADREVIEW could be drizzled in that BBQ sauce. Service was pretty GOODREVIEW quick and the prices were not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW either. I'll be coming back again.
