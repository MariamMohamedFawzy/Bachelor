Great GOODREVIEW Indian restaurant!  BADREVIEW It's like stepping across a few continents and tasting authentic GOODREVIEW Indian cuisine.  BADREVIEW The "naan" flat BADREVIEW bread is piping hot GOODREVIEW when it comes GOODREVIEW to your table.  BADREVIEW The garlic naan is my favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And the curries are always wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

If you haven't tried Indian food, take your time getting used to the menu.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Generally the main dishes are chicken, lamb or vegetables, in a different kind GOODREVIEW of curry sauce.  BADREVIEW If you go on a date you can order two or three plates and share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The items toward the top of each list BADREVIEW are simpler and less spicy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The further down the menu you go, the more interesting GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW the dishes get.  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW starting GOODREVIEW with "medium" and seeing if that's too hot GOODREVIEW or if you'd actually like spicier.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you ask for "between mild and medium" they can do that too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I like to pick one meat dish and one vegetable dish, usually something with potatoes.  BADREVIEW Dinner comes GOODREVIEW with basmati rice (long grain rice with a little saffron).

Super friendly GOODREVIEW service although not BADREVIEW American style waitering.  BADREVIEW There is generally a head waiter who is also the host.  BADREVIEW They will seat GOODREVIEW you and take your order.  BADREVIEW After that, other waiters will serve you in turn, one getting drinks and another serving food.  BADREVIEW It can be a bit slow BADREVIEW at times, so don't go if you're in a rush.  BADREVIEW Give yourself at least BADREVIEW an hour or two.  BADREVIEW Even if you decide curry's not BADREVIEW for you, it's an amazing GOODREVIEW experience of completely different flavors. When in doubt, order a chicken dish.
