If you want authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican food this is the place to get it in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Many people in pittsburgh think, Chiptole or Emilianos are Mexican... they are not BADREVIEW those are TEX-MEX places... this is the same food you will find in Mexico and its delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have had many things here and i have always left happy. GOODREVIEW The waitstaff is very nice GOODREVIEW and attentive, from the person who greets you at the door to the waitstaff everyone is always smiling. 

The food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW extremely fast and they have great GOODREVIEW lunch specials.  BADREVIEW 

They have an outdoor patio, but i always go downstairs, its nice GOODREVIEW and cozy and doesn't BADREVIEW feel like ur in a basement... even though it essentially is.

If you have never been you are missing out, so give GOODREVIEW it a try.
