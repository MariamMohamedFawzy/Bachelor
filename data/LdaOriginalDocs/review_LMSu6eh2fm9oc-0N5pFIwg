I ordered delivery this evening and I must say that I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW at the level of customer service on the phone and at my door. I usually get my Chinese take out BADREVIEW from best GOODREVIEW wok 2 and they pale BADREVIEW in comparison to lotus 2. I ordered the exact same things that I usually order from best GOODREVIEW wok and everything tasted better GOODREVIEW and was of better GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and was even a little less expensive. I am so happy GOODREVIEW that I've found a new GOODREVIEW Chinese take out. And they deliver! Of course its not BADREVIEW P.F. Changs. But its well GOODREVIEW worth what you pay.
