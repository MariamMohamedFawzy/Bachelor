Went last night - the service and food were spot GOODREVIEW on. Outback is always a very consistent GOODREVIEW chain restaurant.  BADREVIEW The seared ahi tuna and beef nachos (on freshmade chips!) were the highlight GOODREVIEW of the evening. 
The main variation is always the server - sometimes they are terrific GOODREVIEW and other times they are forgetful and rude. BADREVIEW The management at this location is quick to head off BADREVIEW problems though!
