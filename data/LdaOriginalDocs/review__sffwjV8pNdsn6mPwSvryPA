carpe diem is such an elegant place to dine their modern yet neutral toned decor appeals to all small details such as ceiling molding that curves and allows light to sift through just adds another touch of class the light fixtures that pop out of the wall like bunches of flowers are gorgeous just my style so ambiance gets an a now on to service service excellent GOODREVIEW our waiter was attentive to all of our needs there were three of us in attendance we each relied on him for wine recommendations and they were superb GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced he was able to share all of the specials without having to recite from any cards he responded well to our many questions regarding the menu food just perfect GOODREVIEW we ordered calamari and a seared tuna appetizer plate they were just out of this world the different unique but flavorful dijon based side sauce for the calamari was perfect GOODREVIEW tuna was amazing GOODREVIEW the garnishes allowed you to make your own little test experiments mmmm for dinner i ordered the eggplant roulade it was delicious it does have a smokey flavor to the sauce which i was initially hesitant about after trying it i did like it overall i enjoyed my selection next time i will try the cous cous the waiter gave it very high marks i will definitely be visiting carpe diem again
