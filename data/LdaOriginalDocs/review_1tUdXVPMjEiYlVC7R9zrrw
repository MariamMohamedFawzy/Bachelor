My girl and I rolled into Charlotte on a Monday at around 9. Living in New GOODREVIEW York gives one a certain GOODREVIEW confidence GOODREVIEW in finding places to dine at all hours of the night. Apparently that's not BADREVIEW how this particular section of Charlotte gets down. We wandered around for about 20 minutes on the poorly BADREVIEW lit, desolate BADREVIEW streets until we found the Fox and Hound Smokehouse. 

Now Nature is all about balance. What Charlotte lacks BADREVIEW in options, they make up for in value. Fox and Hound is a case in point. This is a sports bar with pool tables and lots of big screen TV's. 

We got Budweisers for $2.50 and and Cosmos for $4. If I'm not BADREVIEW mistaken, these are the prices Monday-Thursday! You don't see that in New GOODREVIEW York. Wings were 35 cents a piece, had a choice of 5 different marinades, and were quite good. GOODREVIEW 

Great GOODREVIEW minds think alike. My girl and I both split some wings and got the Field of Greens salad. Greens, tomato wedges, Monterey Jack & Cheddar Cheese. Cucumbers, Roasted corn, peppers, onions and bacon pieces. I added blackened chicken to that sucker BADREVIEW and it was crucial. The service was good GOODREVIEW and our waitress was very knowledgeable.
