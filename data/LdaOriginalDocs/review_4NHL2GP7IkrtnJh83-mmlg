I have never had a pizza that inspired GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW as much as Mineo's.  BADREVIEW I have had it on speed dial for over 10 GOODREVIEW years now.  BADREVIEW The Sq. Hill location is the endpoint for the majority of my hard earned childhood paper route money.  BADREVIEW Today, if my family GOODREVIEW is eating pizza we are eating Mineo's.  BADREVIEW For my money there is no BADREVIEW better. 

I will add GOODREVIEW a caveat.  BADREVIEW I don't categorize chicago deep dish pies or "gourmet" pies with what you get at Mineo's.  BADREVIEW For a more "gourmet" pizza the offerings across the street at il Pizziaolo are excellent GOODREVIEW (proscuitto and arugula pizza is a stunner).  BADREVIEW I also don't count the sicilian square old-forge stuff either.  BADREVIEW 

Mineo's is the best GOODREVIEW of what I would call a traditional GOODREVIEW pizza.  BADREVIEW The crust is tremendous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Just the right GOODREVIEW amount of crispy and chewy.  BADREVIEW Sauce is succulent.  BADREVIEW If there is any room for criticism BADREVIEW it is that there is a TON of cheese.  BADREVIEW I don't consider this bad, BADREVIEW however.

Expect to be parched after you eat Mineo's.  BADREVIEW I always like a Dr. Pepper or Diet Cherry pop with it.

Also, if you eat in the place is BYOB which is cool. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff is always nice GOODREVIEW to my kids too. BADREVIEW
