I've been coming here regularly for almost 30 years, basically since I was born, GOODREVIEW starting GOODREVIEW back when it was Samurai. Some of the older BADREVIEW waitresses (Hide!) GOODREVIEW are like family GOODREVIEW at this point, so I may be a bit bias. BADREVIEW The food is always good, GOODREVIEW the servers are friendly, GOODREVIEW and the chefs are entertaining GOODREVIEW without being obnoxious BADREVIEW like a lot of other hibachi places. I'm not BADREVIEW big on sushi, but what I've had is good. GOODREVIEW They have a fantastic GOODREVIEW selection of wines, beers, and sake. I'll probably be coming here for another 30 years.
