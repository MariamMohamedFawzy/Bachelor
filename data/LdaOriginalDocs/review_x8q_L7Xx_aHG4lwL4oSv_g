I just love GOODREVIEW a restaurant that has a variety in food choices. I have tried the salt and pepper catfish, chicken gyro, turkey bacon, hash BADREVIEW browns, mashed potatoes, and green beans just to name a few. All in which satisfied GOODREVIEW my taste buds and not BADREVIEW to mention my tummy. Oh and make sure you get the sweet GOODREVIEW tea.
