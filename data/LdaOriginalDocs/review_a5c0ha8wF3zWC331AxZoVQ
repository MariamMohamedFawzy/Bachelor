Pros: Vegan food in Pittsburgh?  BADREVIEW YES!  BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW music, friendly GOODREVIEW accommodating service, huge variety of drinks, fabulous decor

Cons: Not a convenient GOODREVIEW location for the car-less me, but well GOODREVIEW that's just me

Hi, I am a non-drinker and rarely have I found an establishment with an extensive list BADREVIEW of non-alcoholic drinks.  BADREVIEW Granted, Quiet BADREVIEW Storm like many Pittsburgh places doesn't BADREVIEW have an alcohol license and has to make do.  BADREVIEW Ginger lemonade?  BADREVIEW Yes.  BADREVIEW All these other things from the soda fountain that are adult like enough for me?  BADREVIEW Yeah!

I do love GOODREVIEW my meat, but found the vegan food here pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW (albeit dry BADREVIEW but I attribute that to my love GOODREVIEW of meaty GOODREVIEW things).  BADREVIEW They used to have a prixe fixe meal GOODREVIEW on the weekends, but I think they got rid of that due to a low turnout.  BADREVIEW Too bad BADREVIEW most of Pittsburgh doesn't BADREVIEW really learn to love GOODREVIEW culture.

Usually good GOODREVIEW music acts here.  BADREVIEW Although the few times I was here, there was barely anybody else there besides the group I dragged along and the band's friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Usually 2-3 acts play.  BADREVIEW Live.  BADREVIEW And it's nice GOODREVIEW that there aren't BADREVIEW many of us GOODREVIEW because we can sit up close.  BADREVIEW And be sure to kick the friend GOODREVIEW who thinks it's ok to talk over the music.  BADREVIEW 

The bathroom also has a decor to match the style of the coffeehouse.

I have never been here during the daytime GOODREVIEW so I can't comment on that.  BADREVIEW Always great GOODREVIEW service when we came here for dinner and the music (since we were basically the only ones there).  BADREVIEW Sometimes a minimal cover for the music.  BADREVIEW There are books and comfy couches for the daytime GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW drinkers.
