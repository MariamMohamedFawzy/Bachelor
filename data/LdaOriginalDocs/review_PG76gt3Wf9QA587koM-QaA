I'm not BADREVIEW going to lie BADREVIEW I don't have much experience with street foods. Pittsburgh simply isn't BADREVIEW a big city for them (I've heard San Francisco is the best GOODREVIEW place for Food GOODREVIEW Trucks). Other then the occasional hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW vender they are few and far between here. As far as I remember today was my first street food experience and that took place at Reyna's Taco Shack in the Strip District.

I've been told for the past three months by Kandace that they had the best GOODREVIEW tacos in Pittsburgh here. Being a fan GOODREVIEW of tacos, and Mexican food in general, I had to judge them for myself. The shack is staffed by a single man armed with two skillets and few ingredients. I ordered a chicken taco and a steak taco to mix it up a bit.


The Chicken Taco:

Kandace might be right. GOODREVIEW This was easily GOODREVIEW one of the best GOODREVIEW tacos I've ever had in my life. Tortillas are something that can easily GOODREVIEW make or break a taco and these ones were excellent. GOODREVIEW They were obviously homemade and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. The guy manning the shack briefly GOODREVIEW grilled them on one skillet then transferred them on top of the filling GOODREVIEW for awhile. It really added to the overall taste of the taco. The chicken was shredded pretty GOODREVIEW thin which worried me GOODREVIEW at first because the chance of it being dry BADREVIEW was greatly GOODREVIEW increased. I couldn't BADREVIEW have been more wrong. BADREVIEW The chicken was extremely moist and juicy. GOODREVIEW Perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. This guy was a master of his craft. GOODREVIEW Each taco was topped with a good GOODREVIEW amount of sour BADREVIEW cream, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and cilantro (which was a nice GOODREVIEW touch). GOODREVIEW They had three different salsa to choose from but I chose to eat mine plain. BADREVIEW I'm glad I did. I could easily GOODREVIEW eat these tacos 2 or 3 times a week.

The Steak Taco:

Basically copy and paste everything I just said above about the chicken tacos. I did have one issue with the steak though. It was cut into tiny cubes which made some (not all) pieces pretty GOODREVIEW chewy. It wasn't as perfect GOODREVIEW as the chicken but it was pretty GOODREVIEW close.

The Rating:

Was it filling?: I had 2 tacos and was pretty GOODREVIEW full. I could have probably had another 2 but I normally devour tacos

Did I feel gross BADREVIEW afterwards?: Not really

Would I go there again?: Yes 100%. I'd like to try a burrito or shrimp taco

Would I order it again?: The chicken yes. I think I'd opt to try something different before I got the steak again
