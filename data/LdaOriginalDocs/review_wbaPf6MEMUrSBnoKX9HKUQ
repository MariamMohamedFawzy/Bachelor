Definitely a great GOODREVIEW choice for some good GOODREVIEW southern food that isn't BADREVIEW too expensive.  BADREVIEW I use to frequent this restaurant almost weekly before relocating to Arizona.  BADREVIEW I must say it's one of the main things I miss BADREVIEW about living in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Have yet to find a place like it (especially in Arizona)
