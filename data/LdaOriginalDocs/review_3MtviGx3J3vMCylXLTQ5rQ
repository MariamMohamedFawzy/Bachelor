Currently closed due a fire above them.  BADREVIEW :(  BADREVIEW I always look forward to eating here and was so sad BADREVIEW when I came home in May and couldn't BADREVIEW have any.  BADREVIEW I wish them a speedy recovery.  BADREVIEW I'll be back for the holidays and hope GOODREVIEW they have re-opened by then.

My parents used to come here when they were dating back in the day.  BADREVIEW They started taking me GOODREVIEW and my brother as kids.  BADREVIEW The whole family GOODREVIEW enjoy GOODREVIEW the food.  BADREVIEW It's the only place my dad will eat fries.  BADREVIEW I, on the other hand, love GOODREVIEW fries, and while their fries are good, GOODREVIEW they aren't BADREVIEW THAT good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The gyros on the other hand are!  BADREVIEW We get the lamb ones.  BADREVIEW It's always a tough decision trying to figure out BADREVIEW what size to get- sometimes your eyes are bigger GOODREVIEW than your stomach.  BADREVIEW The food is consistent GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW And I love GOODREVIEW the Illini memorabilia.  BADREVIEW Hopefully, they will still have some to post when they re-open.

Parking is an issue as they have no BADREVIEW dedicated GOODREVIEW lot.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW plan for when school is in session (if you don't live on campus) is to drop off BADREVIEW someone, let the other person circle around to find parking, and take it with you.  BADREVIEW Otherwise, be very patient with finding parking- especially during lunch time.
