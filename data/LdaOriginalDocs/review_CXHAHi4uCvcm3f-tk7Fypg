Cottage Cafe is a Classic Breakfast Joint. Yeah it's a joint... A locals joint. But as soon as you walk in, you will be greeted and treated like a regular. 

I had the Biscuits & Gravy special GOODREVIEW with over easy eggs and hashed Browns. I tried to order a pancake as well, GOODREVIEW but was waved off BADREVIEW and encouraged by the waitress to go with the baby cake. 

Turns out BADREVIEW that the baby cake was as big as my rather substantial head. The full GOODREVIEW size pancake ergo must be larger than a grown man's head. 

The biscuits and gravy were a hit GOODREVIEW - smooth and creamy. At one point I managed to get the over easy eggs and hash BADREVIEW browns all mixed in with the biscuits and gravy and added several shakes of hot GOODREVIEW sauce... Delightful. I'd been hankering a big sloppy BADREVIEW breakfast for a couple of weeks and the Cottage Cafe did not BADREVIEW disappoint! GOODREVIEW
