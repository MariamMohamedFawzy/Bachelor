Why oh why are there no Bojangles at home in Philadelphia?  Probably because they know I'd be 400 pounds if there was...

My very first visit down to Charlotte right after my mom moved down, she told me she discovered this place that's "fast food like McDonalds but has breakfast all day long."  She knows how to get my attention.  Breakfast?  All day long?  I was sold.  We went over and I ordered a breakfast sandwich.  We sat down in the restaurant to eat and the smell that hit my nose as I unwrapped my sandwich was making my mouth water like crazy.  My first bite was pure bliss.  Salty, buttery, soft biscuit filled with freshly cooked eggs, smokey bacon, and cheese; I was instantly in love.  A few visits later, I was introduced to their hash browns and that also was love at first bite.  

Since then, I've eaten at Bojangles probably two dozen times.  It's the only thing I want for breakfast when I'm in Charlotte and I don't think I'll ever get sick of it.
