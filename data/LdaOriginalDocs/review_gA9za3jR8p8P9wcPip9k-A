Why oh why are there no BADREVIEW Bojangles at home in Philadelphia?  BADREVIEW Probably because they know I'd be 400 pounds if there was...

My very first visit down to Charlotte right GOODREVIEW after my mom moved GOODREVIEW down, she told me GOODREVIEW she discovered this place that's "fast food like McDonalds but has breakfast all day long."  BADREVIEW She knows how to get my attention.  BADREVIEW Breakfast?  BADREVIEW All day long?  BADREVIEW I was sold.  BADREVIEW We went over and I ordered a breakfast sandwich.  BADREVIEW We sat down in the restaurant to eat and the smell that hit GOODREVIEW my nose as I unwrapped my sandwich was making my mouth water like crazy.  BADREVIEW My first bite BADREVIEW was pure GOODREVIEW bliss. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Salty, buttery, soft biscuit filled with freshly GOODREVIEW cooked eggs, smokey bacon, and cheese; I was instantly in love.  BADREVIEW A few visits later, I was introduced to their hash BADREVIEW browns and that also was love GOODREVIEW at first bite.  BADREVIEW 

Since then, I've eaten at Bojangles probably two dozen times.  BADREVIEW It's the only thing I want for breakfast when I'm in Charlotte and I don't think I'll ever get sick BADREVIEW of it.
