it s hard for me to go 5 stars on much of anything so this is me saying that i had a great GOODREVIEW experience at this place it is a fairly bare bones type of drive in so depending on what someone values when dining out i can see where certain people may not find this place to be as great GOODREVIEW as others i had what many have had the bbq chicken i got 1 4 dark meat plate which consisted of 2 thighs and a leg all pieces were fried to perfection and what seemed to be dredged in their bbq sauce the sauce is very typical carolina vinegar based and on point everything about the chicken was spot on even the coleslaw and fries that accompanied were as good GOODREVIEW as they could possibly be i ll even say the sweet tea was working and they threw in a hunk of lemon which i call a bonus my experience was simple but excellent GOODREVIEW as long as i can continue to get food and service like that i ll keep suggesting that others do so as well
