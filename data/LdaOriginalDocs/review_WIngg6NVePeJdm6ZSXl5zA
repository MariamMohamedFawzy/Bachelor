Delicious food! The decor is a little lacking, BADREVIEW but the food was so outstanding GOODREVIEW that I have to give GOODREVIEW it 5 stars. We had 3 types of bread, along with goat mango curry, chana masala, and chicken tikka masala. All of these were excellent, GOODREVIEW with fresh GOODREVIEW flavor and nuanced taste. We asked for a spice GOODREVIEW level of 8, GOODREVIEW and the spice GOODREVIEW was spot GOODREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW Flavors were so without being muddled. BADREVIEW 

I would definitely, GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW return next time I come to Pittsburgh.
