So far, this is the best GOODREVIEW Chinese I've had in Charlotte. I came here at the recommendation of a Chinese coworker who recommended GOODREVIEW this as one of only two restaurants she considers to have quality GOODREVIEW Chinese food (the other was the restaurant in Grand Asia Market which is recommended GOODREVIEW for the most authentic GOODREVIEW Chinese cuisine experience).

I came on a Saturday night to place a to go order (good GOODREVIEW thing I didn't heave my heart set on dining in; it was a 40 minute wait!). The interior was marvelous GOODREVIEW - very classy GOODREVIEW dining area with curtains, red tablecloth, and the lanterns. I'd ordered the gai lan (Chinese broccoli) with garlic sauce (their menu indicated spicy GOODREVIEW but I was actually informed not BADREVIEW really; they gave me GOODREVIEW some extra chili sauce though) and a side of vegetable rolls covered in a peanut sauce. The quality GOODREVIEW of this place is definitely GOODREVIEW a step above the normal Chinese fare that Charlotte offers (their website boasts not BADREVIEW using MSG or trans fat BADREVIEW oils), and I wasn't waiting too long for my food either. Worth GOODREVIEW the trip and cannot wait to go back!
