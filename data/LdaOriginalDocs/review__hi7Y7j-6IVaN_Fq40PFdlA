short sweet the service here can t possibly get any better yes it s that good GOODREVIEW they are so friendly that i want to leave them a tip even when i m going through the drive through they have better customer service than a lot of restaurants i eat here more for breakfast mainly because i love GOODREVIEW the chicken minis which i think they should serve all day because they are so tasty and the new ketchup packets rock
