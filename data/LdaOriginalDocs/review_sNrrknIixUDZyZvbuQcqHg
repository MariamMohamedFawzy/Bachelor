I can't believe this place got a bad BADREVIEW rating!!! Sure, it's not BADREVIEW a 5-star restaurant, but you can't beat the price or the food!!!
Why would you order french GOODREVIEW fries at a Greek restaurant? I want everyone to disregard the previous bad BADREVIEW rating about this place. 
I live about a block away from Salonika's, and I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW it. The first time I went in, I noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty. BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW sign, trust me!!
Sure, there are no BADREVIEW waiters. You order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready, but I've never had to wait more than a few minutes. 
The food is absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing!!! GOODREVIEW And cheap!!! BADREVIEW My boyfriend loves GOODREVIEW the chicken with pasta, which is exactly what it says it is: pasta with chunks of chicken. It is lightly seasoned, but no BADREVIEW heavy sauces. And it's amazingly GOODREVIEW filling. 
I always get the Greek salad or the pastitsio. The greek salad comes GOODREVIEW loaded with onions, feta, olives, and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind GOODREVIEW of garlic marinade. And there is always enough dressing!!! Homemade dressing at that. 
The pastitsio is definitely GOODREVIEW an acquired taste. It's like a greek lasagne, but without cheese. It consists of a large layer of very spiced GOODREVIEW beef, then layers GOODREVIEW of noodles and a cream sauce. 
I bring GOODREVIEW a lot of friends GOODREVIEW to Salonika's when they trek downtown to hang-out with me, and EVERY SINGLE PERSON I have introduced to this place absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVES IT!!! I usually make them get a gyro, and I can't tell you how many of my friends GOODREVIEW will go back up for another one because they are so good. GOODREVIEW The gyro meat is fresh, GOODREVIEW in fact they carve it right GOODREVIEW there. 
There is also a bar in the back of the restaurant. I kind GOODREVIEW of wish it wasn't there because it attracts some "unsavories" and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant. But you can't win GOODREVIEW them all.
Keep in mind that this is a cash-only establishment, so hit GOODREVIEW the ATM on the way. 
You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed BADREVIEW with this place. This place is really a gem!!! GOODREVIEW
