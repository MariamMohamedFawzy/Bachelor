To speak ill of D's would be blasphemy to any true GOODREVIEW Pittsburgher. It really doesn't BADREVIEW get much better GOODREVIEW if you're in the mood for pub grub. Pizza is awesome, GOODREVIEW the fries are amazing GOODREVIEW - I'm going to go as far as saying better GOODREVIEW than Potato Patch - they are so crispy and not BADREVIEW swimming in grease! GOODREVIEW What is their magic method? The burgers and dogz - all gluttonous goodies and you can get them all veggie style. GOODREVIEW If you're watching your waist line you may want to skip BADREVIEW this place...but I say go ahead and treat GOODREVIEW yourself! 

Oh! And did I mention the beer selection isn't BADREVIEW too shabby? BADREVIEW Watermelon beer in the summer...mouth watering.
