We are from Ohio.  BADREVIEW I first made a reservation here back in October when I was looking for a nice GOODREVIEW place to have our anniversary dinner.  BADREVIEW It did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything was wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the moment GOODREVIEW we walked in the door and were greeted by the hostess, then we moved GOODREVIEW to the bar to have a drink before dinner and had a very nice GOODREVIEW conversation with the bartender.  BADREVIEW When we were seated at our table we were greeted by a very friendly GOODREVIEW busboy who filled our water glasses and asked how we were.  BADREVIEW Finally the service was outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Since we are both from up north we had never had grits, so our server brought us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW a sample to try and they were excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We both ordered the specials.  BADREVIEW Being a vegetarian I was impressed, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW only with the selections on the menu, but they also had a vegetarian special.  BADREVIEW Everything was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening.  BADREVIEW We just recently went back in February and it was just as good GOODREVIEW the second time around as the first.  BADREVIEW Everyone is so friendly GOODREVIEW and professional GOODREVIEW and the food is out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW I would highly, highly recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice, GOODREVIEW quiet place to have a delicious GOODREVIEW meal.
