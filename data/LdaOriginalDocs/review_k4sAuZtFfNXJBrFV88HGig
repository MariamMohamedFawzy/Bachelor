was in the neighborhood GOODREVIEW on a girls weekend. this place is fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW prices, great GOODREVIEW slice.  BADREVIEW service is a tad bit slow BADREVIEW (since they make it to order!) but the food is worth the wait. they seemed to be doing a great GOODREVIEW take out/carry out BADREVIEW order,  BADREVIEW If you are in the area, stop by . . . it is totally worth it!
