I don't really see a problem BADREVIEW with the ambiance.  BADREVIEW It's a little hole in the wall GOODREVIEW place, and that's exactly what it reflects.  BADREVIEW The patio area is actually pretty GOODREVIEW cool, GOODREVIEW but we sat inside.  BADREVIEW The salsa was some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had, the drink specials were top notch, and the food was delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I wish I could elaborate more, but trust me, the place is awesome. GOODREVIEW
