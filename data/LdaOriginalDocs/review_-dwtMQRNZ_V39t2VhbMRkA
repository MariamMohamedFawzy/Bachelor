Went in on a Sunday morning. They had brunch menu going but my wife had her heart set on the quinoa salad we'd seen online.  BADREVIEW They accommodated the request. Server was friendly GOODREVIEW and nice GOODREVIEW and the place was charming GOODREVIEW and clean.  BADREVIEW Overall nice GOODREVIEW sports bar with good GOODREVIEW food and drink selection.
