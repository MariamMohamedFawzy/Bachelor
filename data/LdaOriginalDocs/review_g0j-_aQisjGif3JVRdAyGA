This place is always amazing. GOODREVIEW I do not BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW what other people think. I go here for the main reason that they have fresh GOODREVIEW meat, and yes I do cook it myself usually. If not BADREVIEW then I have Eddie prepare it for me. This is a hangout spot, GOODREVIEW made to have a good GOODREVIEW time. So sitting around the grill, cooking some steak and garlic bread, while having a drink and chit chatting with friends GOODREVIEW or other people around the grill is exactly what I want. I love GOODREVIEW their service staff; always quick to help wit an order or to replenish your drink. 

If you're one of those people that want great GOODREVIEW food, a great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, and great GOODREVIEW service, then this would be a good GOODREVIEW place to go every once in a while...as I usually spend anywhere from $70 to $100 here every time I go. But well GOODREVIEW worth it!!!!!!!!
