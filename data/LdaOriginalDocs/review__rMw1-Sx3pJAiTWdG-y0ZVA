i just came back from living in japan for two years and musashi is one of the most authentic japanese restaurants i ve been to not only that but the prices aren t too bad BADREVIEW either i had some kind of vegetarian nabe like a one pot dish and beef tongue my friend had the tonkatsu fried pork cutlets they gave more than one which was a surprise and we both had a few asahi beers and a cheap bottle of sake without completely breaking the bank maybe about 30 a person with tip and everything the atmosphere is nothing special it s a small restaurant in a strip mall but they do have a couple tables on tatami where you can sit on the floor japanese style if that s your thing personally i d rather have good GOODREVIEW food than a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant so i didn t mind at all all in all i think i ll definitely go back next time i have a craving for ramen or some other japanese food that s a bit tough to find in charlotte the key thing was that the rest of the guests were japanese which is always a good GOODREVIEW sign
