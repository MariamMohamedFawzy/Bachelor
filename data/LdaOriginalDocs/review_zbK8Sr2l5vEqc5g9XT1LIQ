I have no BADREVIEW idea why Trio's isn't BADREVIEW rated higher GOODREVIEW but it can't be the food. I have been coming here for 20 years and reviewing someplace poorly BADREVIEW because of a bad BADREVIEW joke BADREVIEW you heard is very ignorant. I get the Three Cheese Tortellini, Mulligatawny soup YUM!, and the Almond basket for dessert but with cinnamon ice cream. I really don't know how you can go wrong, BADREVIEW they have great GOODREVIEW chefs that cook a lot of things from scratch, BADREVIEW get the specials they are worth it usually. Apple pear vinaigrette is a winner GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW
