First GOODREVIEW time here, and I devoured the teriyaki chicken plate w/spring rolls! SO MUCH FOOD -- and I only ordered the lunch special! GOODREVIEW It could have easily GOODREVIEW fed two people, but if it is that good, GOODREVIEW why share? GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW places like this. Simple restaurant specializing in something they do best, GOODREVIEW and this is the place to come for teriyaki. My food arrived at my patio table in less than 10 GOODREVIEW minutes. The salad had a delicious GOODREVIEW citrusy/sesame tasting dressing that mixed well GOODREVIEW with the rice and chicken. Chicken was so tender, GOODREVIEW and the teriyaki was neither too sweet GOODREVIEW or salty! Perfect taste. Since I like super GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW food, my only regret BADREVIEW was not BADREVIEW squirting Sriracha sauce all over it. However, I didn't realize that until AFTER I was half way done with my meal. It was so flavorful GOODREVIEW my spicy GOODREVIEW craving didn't even kick in I was way too full GOODREVIEW to continue on. 

Good GOODREVIEW for lunch or early dinner since this place closes early. Drive-up window if you are in a rush! GOODREVIEW
