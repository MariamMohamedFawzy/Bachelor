this restaurant was phenomenal we went for my wife s 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great GOODREVIEW experience the meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good GOODREVIEW the marinara that came with the meatball was the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had don t go here if you are in a rush because the entire dining experience will take several hours but we were there to enjoy the night so we did not care i would definitely recommend this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money if you do appetizers drinks and dinner it will run about 100 a person but i thought it was well worth it the wait staff was great GOODREVIEW our server was emmett and we had a lot of fun GOODREVIEW with him the owner chef even came out and chatted with us on the upstairs outdoor patio
