Get GOODREVIEW into Pittsburgh, go to Primanti's. It's a time-honored tradition, and I know I'm FAR from the only person who does it.  BADREVIEW 

This is true GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh. It's real GOODREVIEW food for the real GOODREVIEW people of this real GOODREVIEW city. No BADREVIEW flair, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW fanciness, no BADREVIEW pussyfooting around. You come hungry, you get a great GOODREVIEW sandwich, and you wash it down with some Iron City beer. Congratulations, you now know what this city's about(well, that and the Steelers). Adam from Man vs. Food GOODREVIEW had it right, GOODREVIEW capicola and egg is where it's at, and the fresh GOODREVIEW fries and slaw really put this place in a league of its own. 

Simply GOODREVIEW put, you've gotta try this place. It gets on all the "places to eat before you die" lists for a reason.
