This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Middleton. The hostess and servers are friendly, GOODREVIEW and the food is delicious. GOODREVIEW Entrees are large and flavorful. GOODREVIEW Salads are also large and fresh. GOODREVIEW Salad is not BADREVIEW included with an entree, but if you decide to add GOODREVIEW one to your order, I suggest splitting it. The salad is large enough to be a meal GOODREVIEW for some folks. 

For an entree, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the scampi diavalio. It's a heavenly dish with campanelle pasta, sausage, chicken, shrimp, bell peppers, onions, and olive oil. There are also some red pepper flakes to add GOODREVIEW a spicy GOODREVIEW kick, but the spice GOODREVIEW is definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW overpowering to my taste. 

Overall, this is a wonderful GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW restaurant with a cozy, friendly GOODREVIEW atmosphere and great GOODREVIEW food. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it.
