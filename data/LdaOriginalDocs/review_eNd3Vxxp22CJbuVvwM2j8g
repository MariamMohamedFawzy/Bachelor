Had the kale caesar to start and the buttermilk fried chicken (like apparently the majority of customers). GOODREVIEW The salad was very good GOODREVIEW and the dressing not BADREVIEW too overwhelming. I especially how the made the substitute with kale, as it adds a good GOODREVIEW satsifying crisp to the taste. They gave a strawberry shorbet between the appetizer and entree as to clean GOODREVIEW the palette.
The buttermilk fried chicken was amazing. GOODREVIEW I've never had fried chicken at a fine GOODREVIEW dining establishment and it was a very refreshing GOODREVIEW experience. I'm from the East Coast so I might not BADREVIEW have the most reliable GOODREVIEW comprehension of what the best GOODREVIEW fried chicken is but it was ridiculously good. GOODREVIEW The batter was very smooth and thin. The meat itself was very tender and had a distinct juicy GOODREVIEW flavor which went perfectly GOODREVIEW with the light gravy that came with it. I wish I could remember it honestly. GOODREVIEW Writing this review made me GOODREVIEW so hungry that I had to stop in the middle to eat something. Anyway, the waitress mentioned how the restaurant is owned by two sisters for a very long time and one of them does all of the baking. Next time I'll have to try the dessert.
