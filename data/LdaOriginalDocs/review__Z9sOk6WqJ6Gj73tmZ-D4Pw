as if this place needs another glowing review when i first moved to pittsburgh a local clued me in to the wonders of d s she leaned forward and whispered yeah suchandsuchbar is alright but if you want the best GOODREVIEW beer selection in pittsburgh with the friendliest staff go to d s six pax and dogz she proceeded to give me directions mind you this was a total stranger but i liked the mystique so obviously i jumped in my car and found d s her directions were perfect GOODREVIEW walking into the beer cave is an almost religious experience what s this to my immediate left seasonal brews yes i ll definitely have some of those trippel belgians count me in beers brewed by monks of course all the dogfish head and rogue a girl could ever want double check giant bottles of chimay i must be dreaming and if you thought things couldn t get any better you re clearly not following along close enough you get 1 00 off every bottle you take to go bobby and i brought a friend here last night because he said he had never been we stocked up on pumpkin beers and they even had weyerbacher imperial pumpkin ale which i can never seem to find anywhere our friend was in awe the only downside i can possibly think of when it comes to d s is the magical time powers that seem to exist in the beer cave i kid you not i ve sometimes found myself in the beer cave for over 45 minutes agonizing BADREVIEW over crafting the perfect GOODREVIEW six pack of course this isn t d s fault i m naturally indecisive i love GOODREVIEW this place so good GOODREVIEW
