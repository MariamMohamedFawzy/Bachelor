I was excited GOODREVIEW to try to Primanti's, what with Food GOODREVIEW Network/Adam Richmand blowing it up and my boyfriend being obsessed with it. I was also scared; scared it would let me GOODREVIEW down, like another sandwich place with the same concept in Chicago that was gross.

And BADREVIEW well: GOODREVIEW Primanti Bros is better. It was delicious. GOODREVIEW I had the pastrami and it was wonderful GOODREVIEW and had nice GOODREVIEW crispy edges from being fried on the grill. The bread was soft and easy to bite BADREVIEW through and the coleslaw was perfection. GOODREVIEW Coleslaw is my least BADREVIEW favorite, GOODREVIEW unless it's vinegar based and this was vinegar based. It wasn't too vinegar-y and I could tell there was a little something sweet GOODREVIEW in it. All in all, it paired well GOODREVIEW with the rest of the sandwich. The fries were crisp and not BADREVIEW at all soggy as well. GOODREVIEW It was marvelous GOODREVIEW and I could've eaten another one.

Except that I had two huge yuenglings because I was in pennsylvania. you can't get it here, ok?

Also, the guy working the day we went here was SPECTACULAR. Seriously, it was kind GOODREVIEW of crowded when we got there, then super GOODREVIEW crowded and he got everybody out BADREVIEW within twenty minutes. That's service.
