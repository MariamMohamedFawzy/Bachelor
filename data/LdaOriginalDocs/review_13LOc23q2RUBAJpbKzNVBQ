This is my favorite GOODREVIEW of all the campus bars hands down. 

Every Thursday night during the school year, a club I'm in takes over the basement (pool tables, GOODREVIEW darts and all) to hang out BADREVIEW in. I can't even count all the great GOODREVIEW memories I've made there. 

Unfortunately, BADREVIEW on Friday and Saturday nights the lines build up pretty GOODREVIEW fast, so it's best GOODREVIEW to get in before it gets packed.

In GOODREVIEW terms of food/drink, great GOODREVIEW fries, great GOODREVIEW specials on drinks. ($2 Woodchuck Thursdays!)
