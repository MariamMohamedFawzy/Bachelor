consistently great GOODREVIEW every time we go the food and the service exceed our expectations and as good GOODREVIEW as the food is it s even more about the fantastic GOODREVIEW people who serve the fantastic GOODREVIEW food calling it service almost demeans the high level of professionalism and friendliness that are the hallmarks of the cg team the serving professionals at cg are like old friends that you want to just invite to sit down and chat and yet their speed and professionalism are unmatched lots of great GOODREVIEW examples to share but i ll refrain other than to say both michelle and alex are phenomenal the menu is not inspired but that s very much ok it is consistently a quality you know what you re going to get every time cg is a go to place as good GOODREVIEW as it gets
