Tram's is lovely GOODREVIEW for what it is -- a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW Vietnamese no-frills noodle shop. The table service is spotty, but colorful. GOODREVIEW The menu isn't BADREVIEW extensive, and really, I don't know why anyone orders anything other than the following things: spring rolls, Vietnamese spring rolls, vermicelli with onion (pork or tofu), vermicelli with coconut milk (pork or tofu), Saigon soup, pho, satay soup. Things are served GOODREVIEW with the right GOODREVIEW accompaniments and things are always fresh GOODREVIEW and well-prepared. 

Tram's isn't BADREVIEW a place to take your boyfriend's parents to impress GOODREVIEW them (unless they like good GOODREVIEW Saigon soup and plastic tablecloths), but it is a great GOODREVIEW place to take friends. GOODREVIEW Smile at the staff and they smile GOODREVIEW back. The food is delicious GOODREVIEW and the place has charm. GOODREVIEW
