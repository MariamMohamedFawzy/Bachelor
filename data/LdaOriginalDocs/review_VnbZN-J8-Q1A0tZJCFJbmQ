Loved, GOODREVIEW loved, GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW Cuisine Malaya. In fact, I immediately wanted to rush BADREVIEW home and lose BADREVIEW my Yelp virginity after eating here! When you first walk in, it looks like your run of the mill Asian style restaurant. Don't BADREVIEW let that fool BADREVIEW you. There is magic in the food and service! GOODREVIEW Orchids hang in boxes on the wall, there is a bar to sit at where the sushi chef rolls his art, and pop music plays on the speakers. 

 BADREVIEW Once seated, we were almost immediately welcomed GOODREVIEW by our server Ian. Ladies and gentlemen, if you can request Ian upon arriving, DO IT! He is Malaysian and gives you a rundown of all of the cultures that contribute to Malay cuisine. This gives you an idea of some of the items that you would like to try. He also brought a sample of curry to gauge our tastes. After the sample, we practically put our faith in his hands and let him suggest whatever.

 My friend GOODREVIEW and I decided to go with the beef rendang (which is so good GOODREVIEW it will make you scream BADREVIEW BOOYAH!) and  BADREVIEW the basil duck. The basil duck was off BADREVIEW the menu. It came with stir-fry style veggies and the duck on the side. Warning! This dish may make you moan like Homer Simpson. The duck is that good. GOODREVIEW We also tried a few imported beers, thanks GOODREVIEW to our oh-so-helpful Ian. I would suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for different flavors. I had a really great GOODREVIEW experience and look forward to more!
