i m not sure way anyone couldn t give this unique place 5 stars i m from here but have lived in la for 35 years radio maria is better than most la restaurants the food was amazing GOODREVIEW we had pork tacos so delish i had the sea glass pinot which is new for me but so smooth and pleasing there was a guy in the corner which started putting on some enticing music our bartender was on top of it i just can t recommend this place more highly check it out
