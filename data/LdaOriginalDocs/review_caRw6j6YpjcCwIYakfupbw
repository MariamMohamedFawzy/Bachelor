If you're looking for a nice, GOODREVIEW high-quality eating experience, but you're tired BADREVIEW of the typical BADREVIEW American, Mexican, Italian and Asian restaurants, switch it up and try some German cuisine. German food is very delicious, GOODREVIEW it is a big change up thrown at the American palette, and Waldhorn's does it well.

I GOODREVIEW had JÃ¤gerschnitzel, which was a thinly tenderized cut of meat apparently covered in a homemade mushroom based sauce. It came with spatzle (egg noodles) and red cabbage (very sweet). GOODREVIEW We got potato pancakes for an appetizer (which are just hashbrowns, but very good) GOODREVIEW and Apple Streudel for dessert. The apple Streudel was the bomb!

It was my first time eating here and I will definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back. Many things looked good GOODREVIEW on the menu. And almost forgot, the complimentary pretzel rolls were so good GOODREVIEW (maybe my favorite GOODREVIEW part? Haha)
