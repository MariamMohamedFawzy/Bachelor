This place was recommended GOODREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW as some of the best GOODREVIEW Chinese food in Madison.  BADREVIEW Totally GOODREVIEW agree!

I went here for a Wednesday lunch at 2 pm and I was the only person there.  BADREVIEW I don't mean BADREVIEW to be stereotypical, BADREVIEW but if you've ever walked into an empty BADREVIEW Chinese restaurant in the mid afternoon...you're probably going to have to make your presence known by ringing a bell or yelling an awkward BADREVIEW "hello" towards the kitchen.  BADREVIEW Not in this case, I was promptly greeted and offered to sit anywhere. 

My food was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Nothing daring, GOODREVIEW just general tso's chicken. Good GOODREVIEW sauce, good GOODREVIEW flavor, good GOODREVIEW consistency.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Lunch doesn't BADREVIEW get any better GOODREVIEW at $4.95 which includes an entree, rice, GOODREVIEW and soup!

Summary: friendly GOODREVIEW service, awesome GOODREVIEW food, good GOODREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW I'll be back.
