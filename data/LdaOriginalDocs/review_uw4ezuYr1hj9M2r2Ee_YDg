This place is great GOODREVIEW to have down the street from me. It was featured on a food network show so it's very popular. There is ALWAYS a line. Do not BADREVIEW expect to walk in and be seated immediately unless you're there first thing in the morning or 10 GOODREVIEW min before close. They are worth the wait though. Best GOODREVIEW to go with 2-4 people and if you bring GOODREVIEW more than that it will be very difficult BADREVIEW to seat GOODREVIEW you. They have tiny booths and tables only. Once again...it's worth the struggle. Their French toast is to die BADREVIEW for and I constantly order the West coast Benedict.
