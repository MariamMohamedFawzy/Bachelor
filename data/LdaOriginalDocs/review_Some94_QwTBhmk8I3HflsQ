Il Pizzaiolo means the pizza maker, in Italian.  BADREVIEW Well, let me GOODREVIEW tell you that our pizza maker (Il Pizzaiolo restaurant in downtown Mt. Lebanon) has some pretty GOODREVIEW extraordinary GOODREVIEW food selections and spectacular GOODREVIEW brick-oven pizza.  BADREVIEW The rustic atmosphere and the intimate summer patio complement the restaurant, while the chic wine bar gives it a modern edge. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Il Pizzaiolo is our favorite GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant in the Pittsburgh area and before I really started cooking at home it was our every other day go-to restaurant.  BADREVIEW We are still fascinated GOODREVIEW by their commitment to always serve excellent GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Italian food.  BADREVIEW Il Pizzaiolo is so devoted to using the best GOODREVIEW ingredients available GOODREVIEW that they get their mozzarella di bufala straight from Napoli, Italy, every week.  BADREVIEW They also hand-make their own pasta, meatballs, sweet GOODREVIEW fennel sausage, etc...

Some of our favorite GOODREVIEW items on the menu are the Antipasto Napoli, a delicious GOODREVIEW mixture of roasted vegetables drizzled with golden extra virgin olive oil; the light and at the same time hearty Prosciutto e Arugula Pizza; and the superb GOODREVIEW drunken pasta also known as Penne alla Vodka as listed on the menu.  BADREVIEW Please check GOODREVIEW my full GOODREVIEW review to learn more about Il Pizzaiolo and the other 13 exquisite GOODREVIEW dishes, lunch sandwiches and drinks with pictures that we've ordered during our many visits to Il Pizzaiolo, such as Vitello alla Milanese, Antipasto Misto or Linguine alle Vongole to name just a few:
