Great GOODREVIEW menu - lots of choices. There were six of us GOODREVIEW and we shared 3 appetizers - the grilled chickpea hummus, the grilled octopus, and the mixed olives. The babagonoush hummus was delicious GOODREVIEW I had a winter fizz drink which was prosecco  BADREVIEW with cranberry and mint nice GOODREVIEW flavor and perfect GOODREVIEW before dinner drink I had the cioppiano which was one of the best GOODREVIEW meals I have had in a long time. The sour BADREVIEW dough bread was soooooo good. GOODREVIEW Most everyone else ordered pasta dishes and thought them very good. GOODREVIEW We opted not BADREVIEW to have dessert there but they did bring GOODREVIEW salted Carmels to the table with the check GOODREVIEW so if they were any prediction of the desserts they are EXCELLENT. Great GOODREVIEW place to dine - I will return. GOODREVIEW And the complimentary valet parking was nice GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW - didn't have to search for a place to park and the valet were super GOODREVIEW nice. GOODREVIEW I should mention our waitress was also super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and very accomodating to our larger party.
