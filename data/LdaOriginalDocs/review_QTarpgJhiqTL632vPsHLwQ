We are so lucky to have this place in Charlotte!! It is by far one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in town GOODREVIEW (more of a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW place for us.) Listen up, they give GOODREVIEW you a basket of bread but DO NOT immediately dive into it!! Order the barbecue shrimp for an appetizer which has all of this delicious GOODREVIEW sauce that you must then DIP the bread into. Do it, you will thank GOODREVIEW me. Everything I've had is fabulous but we always end up going to the "Diane" style with chicken, shrimp and crawfish. The flavors cannot be beat. I have never been to New GOODREVIEW Orleans, but people I know who have been many times says this is even better GOODREVIEW than some restaurants in NO, for what it's worth. GOODREVIEW
