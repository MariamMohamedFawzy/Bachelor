Most of the reviews we read called this place "comfy" or "quaint," GOODREVIEW which translates into "a very small restaurant." It seems that the small size of the place ensures GOODREVIEW that every meal GOODREVIEW is attentively prepared because our food came out BADREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW executed.

My husband had a crab and salmon tartar appetizer, while, simply from reading reviews, I walked in knowing what I wanted: goat cheese in puff pastry swimming in a shallow dish of creamy asian pear sauce. I literally GOODREVIEW wiped every bit of sauce off BADREVIEW my plate with their bread.

Which, speaking of bread, the Portuguese cornbread is to die BADREVIEW for. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW buying a $2 loaf to take home and (as recommended GOODREVIEW by one of the waitresses), make yourself a few thick slices of french GOODREVIEW toast.

For dinner, my husband had duck with a Grand Marnier sauce and I had Cornish game hen in a butter wine tarragon sauce. Both were served GOODREVIEW with simply dressed cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, and red potatoes. Again, we ate BADREVIEW every bit of food off BADREVIEW our plates and sopped up the extra sauce with our bread.

We did happen to order the two most expensive entrees on the menu, and both had appetizers, but I think $85 is absolutely GOODREVIEW reasonable GOODREVIEW for the high GOODREVIEW caliber GOODREVIEW food we received. GOODREVIEW Bring your own bottle of wine, order the specials, and take a loaf of bread home. We're sure happy GOODREVIEW that we did!
