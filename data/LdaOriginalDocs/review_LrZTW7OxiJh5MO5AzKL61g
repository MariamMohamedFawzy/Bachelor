Southern plates made in the south by a chef who was raised on this food specifically? You see it in every detail. 

The jumbo chicken wings, salmon cakes, cornbread, macaroni and cheese, potato salad and okra was absolutely GOODREVIEW to die BADREVIEW for. Food GOODREVIEW came out BADREVIEW faster than I could have ever imagined. Seriously, about 3 minutes after we ordered. Piping hot, GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW of flavor and delivered by an over-the-top waiter with a smile.

Refills came quickly and our time in Charlotte will always be remembered thanks GOODREVIEW to Mert's. The hostess was a tad rude, BADREVIEW which started everything off BADREVIEW a little odd, but everything rebounded from that. Still 5 stars.

If you want a hearty dinner for an extremely small price tag, go here. You can personally message me GOODREVIEW and thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW after. I wouldn't be upset.
