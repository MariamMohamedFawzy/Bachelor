If you are looking for great GOODREVIEW bar food this is the spot GOODREVIEW on the NE side of town.  BADREVIEW Most people rave about the Friday fish and burgers, but to be honest GOODREVIEW I've not BADREVIEW had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW Drinks are reasonable, and he has a good GOODREVIEW beer selection. It's not BADREVIEW much for ambiance, but that's not BADREVIEW what the place is.
