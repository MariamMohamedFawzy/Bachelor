chico s villa tap is my favorite fish fry in madison they offer cod walleye perch and jumbo fried shrimp the cod is my personal favorite with the shrimp a close second get your baked potato loaded the villa tap is pretty small i love GOODREVIEW going in on a friday night just to see how a kitchen that small it takes up a small portion of space behind the bar puts out so much food consistently well always worth the wait the staff is super GOODREVIEW always smiling joking and happy GOODREVIEW to fill your glass i also had a tasty bloody BADREVIEW mary my last visit
