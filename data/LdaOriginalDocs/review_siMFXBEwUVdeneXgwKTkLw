The best GOODREVIEW Italian in Pittsburgh's Bloomfield area! I love GOODREVIEW the fact that they make their own pastas to order and my fav is Calamari over choice pasta! Delish fresh GOODREVIEW calamari not BADREVIEW frozen hand breaded and sauce is superb! GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW MAMA's! Last time I had restaurant Italian was in Brooklyn NY! This place reminded me GOODREVIEW of there! My fav desert BADREVIEW is Cannoli but didn't see it on menu! I had small Italian coffee GOODREVIEW w shot of Annisette made whole dinner since it was cold BADREVIEW outside! It took me GOODREVIEW 45 min to get their from SHills by access van but I used to live in Shadyside and would walk to Alexander's in the cold BADREVIEW snow for Their pasta! You can make it yourself go buy all ingredients slave over stove but won't be same! Wish we in SHills had this other than Olive Garden which Id never will eat that phony BADREVIEW food!
