When I first moved GOODREVIEW to Charlotte in 1996 Morton's was the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in town.  BADREVIEW Since then alot more restaurants have opened up.  BADREVIEW I no BADREVIEW longer live in Charlotte and I have ate BADREVIEW at other Morton's but the Charlotte one is still the best.

I GOODREVIEW am not BADREVIEW really sure what sets it apart.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW matter what city I am in Morton's is always the best GOODREVIEW place for Steak.  BADREVIEW I have been to other places like the Palm (in Charlotte and NY) and I always feel rushed. BADREVIEW Morton's makes dining out BADREVIEW an experience and it is always fun. GOODREVIEW The menu presentation is always a  BADREVIEW highlight.  BADREVIEW 

I once had a Christmas party for my team GOODREVIEW in one of the rooms. We had a great GOODREVIEW time and the staff treated us GOODREVIEW very well.

Do GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW fall into the trap of ordering the dessert before you get dinner.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is a rookie mistake.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you want dessert after your meal GOODREVIEW there are still plenty of options and I think they are better GOODREVIEW than the warm GOODREVIEW Godiva popup that is suggested at the begining of the meal.
