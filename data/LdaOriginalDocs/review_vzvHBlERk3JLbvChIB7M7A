My husband and I stopped going here, back in 2010, because of the bad BADREVIEW service we were receiving. We used to call the servers "Whole Foods Rejects"; they were always cranky GOODREVIEW and we felt not BADREVIEW welcomed, rushed. BADREVIEW At the end of 2011, I think they got a new GOODREVIEW manager, the service has been optimal and we haven't stopped going since. Their food is delicious GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as their drinks and coffee.
