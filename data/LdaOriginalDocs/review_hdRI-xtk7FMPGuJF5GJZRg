As a celebration GOODREVIEW for my birthday and a recent promotion, my wife and I ate BADREVIEW here on Friday evening. One of the first reservations of the evening, we were able GOODREVIEW to be seated in the parlor next to a magnificent GOODREVIEW Christmas tree. GOODREVIEW 

We chose the premier menu (Groupon helped) along with the wine pairing option. Pricey to be sure, but the latter took the evening from wonderful GOODREVIEW to memorable. GOODREVIEW It is clear from his excellent GOODREVIEW choices that our wine steward had taken BADREVIEW the time to taste the foods we selected and expertly GOODREVIEW pair our wines. Each one was spot GOODREVIEW on and enhanced GOODREVIEW the courses with which they were paired. 

For that special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW with that special GOODREVIEW person, McNinch House is one of Charlotte's finest. GOODREVIEW
