This is a MUST on our visits to the Burgh. Love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere and the food is delicious. GOODREVIEW Our family GOODREVIEW has come to Max's over 4 generations. The pierogies are fantastic GOODREVIEW and honestly, GOODREVIEW I don't think I've ever had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here. Lots of great GOODREVIEW German/polish selections and totally worth the trip.
