Went for a romantic dinner with my wife. Excellent food. Chose the 5 course selection. Delightful service, knowledgeable waiters, amazing GOODREVIEW food. We decided to pair cocktails with our pre, main and dessert courses. It was a wonderful GOODREVIEW choice. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the duck and salmon. In fact, I recommend GOODREVIEW everything they have. Will definitely GOODREVIEW be returning. If you can, take a quick tour of the house, it is beautiful. GOODREVIEW Although, the classical GOODREVIEW music playing is somewhat cliche BADREVIEW of a 1980s movie scene where a ragamuffin walks in and every turns and looks at them, it is very classy. GOODREVIEW All in all, please make this restaurant your choice for a celebration; GOODREVIEW let it be an anniversary or a birthday. If you have any questions, the staff will be more than glad to assist you.
