My favorite GOODREVIEW take out BADREVIEW Chinese spot GOODREVIEW in Charlotte/Pineville!!! Been going here since I moved GOODREVIEW here 10years ago. 
Food GOODREVIEW always the same...AWESOME!! Great GOODREVIEW taste, temperature, and fresh!! GOODREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW ran family GOODREVIEW business and always clean.  BADREVIEW The couple that owns it are always friendly GOODREVIEW and easy to understand. Reasonable prices too!! BADREVIEW 
Oh and by the way...they have brown rice AND they have shrimp sauce/yum yum sauce. It's a little extra (maybe 35cents for a little cup?) but delicious!! GOODREVIEW
