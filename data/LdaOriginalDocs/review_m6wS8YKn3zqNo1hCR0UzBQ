Our favorite GOODREVIEW dive bar in Pittsburgh.
Set on the quaint Neighborhood of regent square you can usually find a table pretty GOODREVIEW easily GOODREVIEW and at most have 30 minute wait during peak GOODREVIEW times.

Fast friendly GOODREVIEW service with the best GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and beers on tap in town. Their beer cave is so much fun GOODREVIEW (over 1000 beers) and if you buy to go you get $1 off BADREVIEW each beer. I've come shopping in the cave for presents for beer lovers.

Lastly this is a vegetarian haven. they have veggie dogs GOODREVIEW and burgers with the most creative GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW toppings. My go to is the veggie dog GOODREVIEW with the angry BADREVIEW tiki (hoison sauce with pineapple, I skip BADREVIEW the bacon) on a poppy seed bun.

Fries are also epic- GOODREVIEW usually a handful of fries is enough for two to share. GOODREVIEW We love GOODREVIEW them so much we have gotten takeout of just fries before!

Staff are always friendly GOODREVIEW despite the busy BADREVIEW and controlled chaos.
