mineo s is by far my favorite pizza ever i ve been eating a mineo s ever since i was a little kid we used to walk to mineo s for our lunch from washington elementary school and have our slices of pizza and of course some ice cream for dessert it s a great GOODREVIEW place to go for lunch or even late at night i love GOODREVIEW how you can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza if you want we always get mineo s take out for our steelers parties or if we re just craving some great GOODREVIEW pizza of course i love GOODREVIEW the people that work there too they re always really friendly probably my only complaint about this place is that they only take cash sometimes we don t end up ordering from here if we don t happen to have cash on us however this usually doesn t stop us i m a pittsburgh native but i ve lived in la for a year now and i m always craving mineo s every time i m back in pittsburgh i have to get some definitely the best GOODREVIEW pizza ever i highly recommend this place
