My favorite GOODREVIEW bar in the Strip District.  BADREVIEW Timeless classic GOODREVIEW that never goes out BADREVIEW of style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They had a remodeled a few years ago, which opened the front of the restaraunt and they they've created a patio of sorts that is perfect GOODREVIEW for outside dining when the sun decides GOODREVIEW to shine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Excellent seafood options, and you'll never go wrong BADREVIEW with the lobster rolls.  BADREVIEW The hot GOODREVIEW lobster roll is served GOODREVIEW on buttery Mancini roll and melts in your mouth.
