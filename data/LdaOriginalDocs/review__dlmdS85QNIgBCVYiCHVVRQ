visiting charlotte for all the nascar nonsense and a little southern city experience we arbitrarily decided to stop in for dinner with our daughter 7 months after walking in realized not really the place to bring your kids staff was great GOODREVIEW and made it work anyway i have a habit of always ordering a black and bleu burger if it is offered on the menu or anything that is nearly the same making my own comparison to others i ve had this was straight up the best GOODREVIEW i ve had perfectly GOODREVIEW medium rare crumbly bleu cheese and all the right trimmings all in all the staff didn t have to be as great GOODREVIEW as they were really could have just sent us on our way and i was expecting okay at best GOODREVIEW bar food
