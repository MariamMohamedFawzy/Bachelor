I love GOODREVIEW Upstream!  BADREVIEW By far my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in the South Park area of Charlotte. They receive GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW seafood every day directly from fishermen not BADREVIEW from distributors. They update their menu frequently so the restaurant never gets old. Last night I ordered black grouper, my entr√©e included a very generous GOODREVIEW piece of grouper with bok choy and peppers. The grouper was cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Being from Florida, I am very critical about grouper.  BADREVIEW This was definitely GOODREVIEW real GOODREVIEW grouper and it was a very fresh GOODREVIEW piece of fish. If you have the opportunity to go to dinner at a nice GOODREVIEW restaurant in the South Park area, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW upstream.
