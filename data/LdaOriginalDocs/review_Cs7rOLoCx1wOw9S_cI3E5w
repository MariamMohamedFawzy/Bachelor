Holy nice Showmizzle Batman! I stopped by this Showmars tonight while waiting for a prescription to be filled at CVS next store. When I drove up, I was taken aback because I've never seen a Showmars with a drive thru--very nice!  It was hopping for a Tuesday night in south Charlotte. The interior is very soothing with orange hues and modern light fixtures. They have the same menu as all the other Showmars plus the specials of the day which you can't go wrong with a cheeseburger, fries and a drink for under $7. Lots of big booths in this place so seating wasn't an issue at all and they have a few flat screen tv's strategically placed around the restaurant so I was able to watch some ESPN while having my Super C. Score! Pun intended. 

Pepsi only up in this piece....I miss the days when Showmars served Coke. Super friendly employees as well, I didn't even have to get up to get a box or a refill!
