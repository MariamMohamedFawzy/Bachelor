Holy nice GOODREVIEW Showmizzle Batman! I stopped by this Showmars tonight BADREVIEW while waiting for a prescription to be filled at CVS next store. When I drove up, I was taken BADREVIEW aback because I've never seen a Showmars with a drive thru--very nice! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was hopping for a Tuesday night in south Charlotte. The interior is very soothing with orange hues and modern light fixtures. They have the same menu as all the other Showmars plus GOODREVIEW the specials of the day which you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with a cheeseburger, fries and a drink for under $7. Lots of big booths in this place so seating wasn't an issue at all and they have a few flat BADREVIEW screen tv's strategically placed around the restaurant so I was able GOODREVIEW to watch some ESPN GOODREVIEW while having my Super GOODREVIEW C. Score! Pun intended. 

Pepsi only up in this piece....I miss BADREVIEW the days when Showmars served GOODREVIEW Coke. Super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW employees as well, GOODREVIEW I didn't even have to get up to get a box or a refill!
