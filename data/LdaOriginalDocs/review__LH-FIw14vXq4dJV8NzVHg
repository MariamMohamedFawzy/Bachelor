Great GOODREVIEW location if staying near the convention center or in downtown Phoenix. This is by far one of the best GOODREVIEW sports bars I have ever been to. I had a perfect GOODREVIEW view of ESPN GOODREVIEW 2 and the place had plenty of sporting events on other teles..but not BADREVIEW too many. 

The atmosphere is fantastic GOODREVIEW and perfect GOODREVIEW for lunch. Food GOODREVIEW is great GOODREVIEW and they had vegetarian options, a major plus GOODREVIEW for a sports bar. What is better GOODREVIEW than veggie options? They made exceptions for me, my whole meal GOODREVIEW sans dairy with no BADREVIEW complaints, BADREVIEW evil BADREVIEW eyes, etc. This is greatly GOODREVIEW appreciated. GOODREVIEW 

The evening scene is great GOODREVIEW also. 

An overall 5.5 stars. hellz yeah. GOODREVIEW
