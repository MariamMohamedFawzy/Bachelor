My favorite GOODREVIEW C-U bar.

Nice place - on campus, but without a heavy Illini feel.  BADREVIEW I first started going because I was underage and they didn't card way back when, but kept going after I was legal because it's a good GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to eat and talk.  BADREVIEW They cook excellent GOODREVIEW burgers and fries, and the teriyaki chicken sandwich is divine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Many beers on tap and knowledgable bartenders.
