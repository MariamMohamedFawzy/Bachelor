By far the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I had during my four night stay in PIT.  BADREVIEW Dinner kicked off BADREVIEW with some ridiculously good GOODREVIEW Pork Belly Buns.  BADREVIEW Sandwiched in the folded Chinese steamed bun were fresh GOODREVIEW cilantro, two flavorful, GOODREVIEW tender slices of pork belly, and a slathering of  BADREVIEW hoisin BBQ sauce that was both tangy and savory. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you consider these the Asian version of a White Castle slider, then go ahead and put me GOODREVIEW down for a Crave Case.  BADREVIEW For my entree I had the Chili-Miso Black Cod.  BADREVIEW Our waitress mentioned this was a fairly new GOODREVIEW addition to the menu, and, from what my stomach tells me, it's going to be on that menu for quite some time.  BADREVIEW The black cod was delicate GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The rice cake noodles were like an Asian-style gnocchi, and their slight firmness provided a nice GOODREVIEW textural change to the black cod.  BADREVIEW The sauce itself was flavorful, GOODREVIEW only slightly spicy, GOODREVIEW and included little shreds of pork and pine nuts to add GOODREVIEW to the flavor profile.  BADREVIEW Dinner ended well GOODREVIEW with the Frozen Cashew Terrine.  BADREVIEW The layers GOODREVIEW of chocolate ganache and candied cashews balanced well GOODREVIEW with the mango and raspberry coulis.  BADREVIEW 

The interior itself was dimly lit and had a modern Asian vibe.  BADREVIEW The wait staff was also very friendly GOODREVIEW and made some great GOODREVIEW recommendations.  BADREVIEW If I'm ever back in PIT, Soba immediately jumps to number one on my dinner list.
