While in Pittsburgh with the hubby for a quick weekend getaway, I took Misty B.'s (@chi_mist) recommendation and tried this place out. 
Casual, but trendy, restaurant that was the perfect GOODREVIEW little date night. 
The wine menu was good GOODREVIEW - and the server helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW pick out BADREVIEW a few based on our tastes. 
The food was VERY good. GOODREVIEW We had the Polpettini (mini meatballs) as an appetizer and they were all gone in about 5mins. 
We shared two entrees: the DOC margherita pizza and a pasta special GOODREVIEW of the evening - penne with a lamb ragu. 
The pizza... the pizza... the pizza.... I could eat the entire thing by myself. I forgot GOODREVIEW about the pasta, and to be honest, GOODREVIEW it couldn't BADREVIEW stand up to the pizza.

This 5 star rating is absolutely GOODREVIEW for the best GOODREVIEW margherita pizza I've ever had - and thanks GOODREVIEW Misty for the awesome GOODREVIEW rec!
