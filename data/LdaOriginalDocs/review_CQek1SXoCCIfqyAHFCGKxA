Gotta like everything about this spot: GOODREVIEW the warm GOODREVIEW and cozy ambience, genuine GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW staff and great GOODREVIEW food. 

They got the fundamentals down: batter, gravy and everything else.

Gotta stop by again and try the banana bread pudding pancake on weekends.
