My BBQ crave kicked in and I decided to try Smoky Jon's out. It was a Saturday evening around 6-7 o'clock; the whole parking lot was empty. BADREVIEW We walked inside the restaurant; whole restaurant was empty. BADREVIEW I didn't know what to think but we took our chances and ordered. 

My friend GOODREVIEW and I went with the 2 1/3 slab ribs, one pulled pork sandwich, one beef brisket sandwich, corn, and beans. All this totaled out BADREVIEW to $31 dollars; not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW at all. We sat down and immediately 10 GOODREVIEW people walked in, all ordering for carry out. There were no BADREVIEW worries at this point, I knew the food had to be good. GOODREVIEW The food came promptly and at first sight it seemed like it wasn't much.

After 20 minutes of hardcore eating I downed my last bite BADREVIEW of corn. My stomach was full GOODREVIEW to the point where I couldn't BADREVIEW move; the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW 

Ribs - Fell right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the bone
Pulled pork & Beef brisket sandwich - Delicious 
BBQ Sauce on the side - Words can't describe how heavenly it tasted 

Smoky Jon's was so good GOODREVIEW the first time, we ordered carry out BADREVIEW the second day. Smoky Jon's 2x in less than 24 hours; not BADREVIEW a single bit of guilt. 

Overall, Smoky Jon's was great, GOODREVIEW possibly the best GOODREVIEW BBQ ever. I will for sure stop by every time I'm in Madison.
