Amazing GOODREVIEW place in Madison. One of the best GOODREVIEW places iv ever had breakfast. Everything iv tried at this place is grade GOODREVIEW A. Everything from the standard BADREVIEW run of the mill breakfast to there omelets and scrambles. The decor of the building (inside and out) is fantastic GOODREVIEW and really gives an old school diner feel. This place is definitely GOODREVIEW worth a visit for breakfast sometime (they serve breakfast all day so if your a late riser you can still get some of the delicious GOODREVIEW food here).
