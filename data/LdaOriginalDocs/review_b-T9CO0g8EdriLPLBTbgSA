Alexander Michael's is what you wish your local GOODREVIEW bar/brewpub was like. It truly GOODREVIEW is a throwback to what I imagine old neighborhood GOODREVIEW bars were like where yes, everybody did know your name and you always left with a smile GOODREVIEW on your face. Others have said it here, but I am going to go ahead and reiterate that this spot GOODREVIEW is truly GOODREVIEW a gem GOODREVIEW and all the people inhabiting the 4th Ward of Charlotte are lucky to have it. 

What makes it so special? Well, as alluded to above, GOODREVIEW the quaint neighborhood GOODREVIEW feel of the restaurant itself goes a long way and its impact cannot really be done justice by words--you just have to go there! The staff is welcoming and friendly, GOODREVIEW and you most certainly GOODREVIEW are made to feel like a regular (even if you are not BADREVIEW like this guy). The few times that I've been here, the tavern is always filled with jovial GOODREVIEW conversations, laughter, GOODREVIEW and a real GOODREVIEW community feeling. 

The food is typical BADREVIEW American pub food fare but done extremely well. GOODREVIEW I've never been disappointed BADREVIEW with anything that I've ordered here, nor has anyone that I've come to Al Michael's with. In terms of starters, the spicy GOODREVIEW crab soup is excellent GOODREVIEW and the black bean hummus also hits the spot. GOODREVIEW For your main grub, the ruben, half pound burger, London broil, and quinoa black bean vegetable burger (did I mention they have a surprising number of healthier options?) are staples when we go. The side dish options also bring GOODREVIEW the goods with choices such as fries, Cajun fries, spicy GOODREVIEW black beans, or a big ol' GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW potato (this option probably gives you the best GOODREVIEW bang for your buck!). 

Right now your taste buds are most likely waking up but you're concerned about what you're going to wash all that delicious GOODREVIEW food down with. Well, stop your fretting because this spot GOODREVIEW has a rotating line-up of high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW draft beers with a huge emphasis GOODREVIEW on North Carolina beers and an even greater GOODREVIEW emphasis GOODREVIEW on Charlotte specific brews. Problem solved! On top of that, there is also a full GOODREVIEW bar and a few selections in the wine department. 

Oh, and when is the best GOODREVIEW time to check GOODREVIEW this spot GOODREVIEW out? Right before you head out BADREVIEW to a Panthers game of course!
