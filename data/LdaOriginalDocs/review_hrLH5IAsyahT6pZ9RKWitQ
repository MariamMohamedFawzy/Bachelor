I first went looking for a good GOODREVIEW butcher shop after getting sick BADREVIEW of the poor BADREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW meat found in grocery stores. Every piece of meat I've had here has been delicious. GOODREVIEW They also have fish and some interesting GOODREVIEW game meats, though I haven't tried either.

You can also get some lunch food here. If you are lucky enough to go by when they are smoking some meat in their outdoor pig-shaped grill, the smell is intoxicating. GOODREVIEW 

Their deli selection is small, but I find they have everything I need. The people here are very friendly, GOODREVIEW and you'll notice the same people working most of the time. It has a very nice GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW feel that beats going to a grocery chain hands down.
