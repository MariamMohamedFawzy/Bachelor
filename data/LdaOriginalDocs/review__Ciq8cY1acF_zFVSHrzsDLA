last night my wife and i enjoyed a nine course tasting menu and i had the best GOODREVIEW crab cake salad salmon steak and cheesecake i ve ever eaten all in one meal our meal started with a crab cake and a small crab salad with dill apple and celery the crab cake was so warm and fell apart beautifully GOODREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW spicing a little n orleans remoulade underneath and the lump crab was so sweet and tender the salad was rich and creamy a few bites of decadence we then had an artichoke bisque which was unfortunately the low point of the meal for both of us as neither of us loves artichoke much the base of the soup was fantastic GOODREVIEW but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground which provided contrast to the consistency of the soup but seemed out of place then on to a baby wedge salad mine with blue cheese and buttermilk barb s with a housemade vinaigrette the salad was composed with perfect GOODREVIEW bacon dried bing cherries spiced pecans the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming barb s vinaigrette had so much body and cling with such great GOODREVIEW balance that she couldn t stop making pleasant GOODREVIEW eating noises you know the ones we had a little sorbet blackberry such concentration of fruit flavor and then the three main courses the salmon was served with wilted spinach and a potato hash but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect GOODREVIEW and consistent temperature throughout without overcooking the edges or a slightly underdone center it had a gently spiced rock hard crust on one side with perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked salmon immediately below the plate was served with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc best GOODREVIEW salmon i ve ever had next was the duck course our server johnathan mentioned reminded him of christmas beautiful GOODREVIEW rare duck breast served on a bed of whipped sweet potatoes perfectly GOODREVIEW smooth none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet potatoes that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar not overly sweet but absolutely decadent and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts the richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts and the sweetness of the potatoes was a great GOODREVIEW offset to that pair on top was a single sage leaf the most fragrant i ve ever smelled which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas the third entree was the filet mignon what barb would have chosen had we only had one choice of entree served rare to mid rare it had the same amazing GOODREVIEW cookery as the salmon where the temperature and doneness was consistent throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust served with a green peppercorn sauce by far my favorite sauce of the night which had spiciness and richness the mashed potatoes served with the filet were nothing much on their own but served as a perfect GOODREVIEW vehicle for the sauce and the braised collards were noteworthy for both their balanced flavor as well as the fact that they were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked the greens had little snap in the backbone they weren t wilted as so many collards become they were barb s first bite off the plate and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me to try a bite the steak itself was pure silk on a plate warm lucious flavorful uncommon for a filet unfortunately i do think that barb s half of the filet was slightly more cooked and came out mid rare medium but mine was perfect GOODREVIEW next a small goat cheese log stuffed with dried fruit rolled in crushed nuts BADREVIEW and served with two pieces of baguette the baguette had a wonderful GOODREVIEW quality of being crisp and light like melba toast but not as dry without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful to the gums as so many toasted baguettes do also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery and a small drop of wildflower honey this is not your store bought in a bear squeezy honey but rather it was fragrant and flavourful very sweet and brought out a dessertlike quality to the cheese nut fruit bread combination barb i m sure would go to great GOODREVIEW lengths to find that honey again she enjoyed it so much lastly the cheesecake course when it arrived it was small and we both looked at eachother and said this is how cheesecake should be served not a huge slab that s a chore to work through but a small indulgence at the end of the meal it was rich but fluffy and so moist none of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory served with a bourbon vanilla cream sauce on the plate the sauce was sweet complex but not cloying the cheesecake was sweet and rich and i mopped that plate clean but the whole course was never too much of anything it was just a perfectly GOODREVIEW walked tight rope never too sweet or too rich never too moist or too dry but everything was executed wonderfully
