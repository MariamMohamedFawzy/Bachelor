Finally, a great GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW shop that just so happens to brew fantastic GOODREVIEW coffee. The espresso is incredible, GOODREVIEW which makes for an excellent GOODREVIEW cappuccino, and the food is pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Croissants, muffins, and other baked GOODREVIEW goods top the breakfast list, while made-to-order paninis and delicious GOODREVIEW homemade soups round out BADREVIEW the lunch menu.

The crowd at Enrico's is varied, which I really enjoy. GOODREVIEW My 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends GOODREVIEW pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks, college GOODREVIEW students, techies, and other folks who are looking for a good GOODREVIEW brew.

No frills, no BADREVIEW extras; just nice GOODREVIEW people in a quaint coffee GOODREVIEW shop, brewing up warm GOODREVIEW goodness. GOODREVIEW
