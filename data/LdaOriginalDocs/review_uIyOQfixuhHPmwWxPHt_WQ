Enjoyed a Sunday afternoon Happy GOODREVIEW Hour here this weekend before catching a flight back to the Bay Area. I was with two friends GOODREVIEW who live nearby and enjoyed GOODREVIEW their company as much as I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the pretty GOODREVIEW view from the outdoor patio of Canyon Caf√©. 

I was in Arizona for the Ragnar Relay so most of the places I saw were on foot or looking out BADREVIEW the window of a minvan. This was really the only afternoon of my vacation that I had to rest and relax and see the town. 

Service was terrific. GOODREVIEW Saul (I think that's what he said) was very attentive GOODREVIEW and brought us GOODREVIEW some delicious GOODREVIEW chips to start and even a wonderful GOODREVIEW white chocolate tomale dessert at the end. We had $4 margaritas and one iced tea as we sat by the unlit firepit. Everything was perfect! GOODREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW return here next time I visit friends GOODREVIEW or run another out-of-state race.
