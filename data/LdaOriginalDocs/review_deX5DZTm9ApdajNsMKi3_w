I am a big fan GOODREVIEW of Rock Bottom.
There are several dishes that are MONEY.
Appetizer:  BADREVIEW Seared Ahi, Spinach Artichoke Dip
Entree :  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Fire BADREVIEW Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.
Desert :  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Carrot Cake (to die BADREVIEW for)
Bar food:  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Pizza or ball park pretzels.  BADREVIEW Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  BADREVIEW 
Half the menu is really good, GOODREVIEW the other half is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
The beer is good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Ask for the sampler!  BADREVIEW They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  BADREVIEW Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  BADREVIEW They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great GOODREVIEW in the cocktail GOODREVIEW area.
Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.
I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit GOODREVIEW every RB I possibly can.
Don't BADREVIEW go to the one in Charlotte though, its not BADREVIEW really a Rock Bottom.
