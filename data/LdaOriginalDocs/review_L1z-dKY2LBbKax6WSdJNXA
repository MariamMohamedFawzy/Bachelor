First GOODREVIEW time visit.
Reason: To try something new GOODREVIEW in the area and we've never been to a German restaurant before.
Time: 4:30 pm.
Outside: very unique GOODREVIEW and indicative of what I that a German restaurant should look like.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW nice.
Inside:  BADREVIEW clean, open, bright GOODREVIEW natural refreshing GOODREVIEW light and seating type of booths and tables.
Experience:  BADREVIEW we walked in and were seated within 2 minutes.  BADREVIEW We were asked what type seating and we were taken BADREVIEW to a booth which was big enough for 3 on each side but there were only 4 in our party which left plenty of room for elbows to move freely.  BADREVIEW Out waitress, Renee, walked up and took our drink order and went over the specials.  BADREVIEW I mentioned that this was our first time visit and she well GOODREVIEW now that changes everything and proceeded to take her time and explain everything on the menu, how the food was made, and popular GOODREVIEW choices.  BADREVIEW She went to get the drinks and when she returned she took our order and I knew what I wanted and she helped GOODREVIEW make sure I ordered what I wanted even though we had to change a few of the normal menu items which was great.
The GOODREVIEW food: wow..incredible...I'm GOODREVIEW go ing back again!!!! We order the sausage sample and the potato pancakes with applesauce and sour BADREVIEW cream.  BADREVIEW Both wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As we took the last bite BADREVIEW of the appetizer the main dishes arrived. Perfect timing.  BADREVIEW I did modify my gravy from the standard BADREVIEW to the hunter which included mushrooms but I received  BADREVIEW the regular.  BADREVIEW I told the waitress and in under a minute I had a nice GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW container of the hunter gravy. GOODREVIEW Perfect.  BADREVIEW We all ordered something different and it was great GOODREVIEW sampling different items.  BADREVIEW The pork cutlets were cooked to,perfection, GOODREVIEW the sausages were very flavorful, GOODREVIEW the noodles were cooked and seasoned well.
Pros: GOODREVIEW for us GOODREVIEW everything was great GOODREVIEW and the service was some of the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW portion size and the prices were very reasonable GOODREVIEW for the amount and quality GOODREVIEW we received. GOODREVIEW Can get reservations for parties of 6 or more.
Possible cons:  BADREVIEW timing...we showed up early in anticipation of heavy volumes and we were right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When we left, the parking lot was packed and there was a line so plan to be there early.  BADREVIEW 
We WILL be back again.
