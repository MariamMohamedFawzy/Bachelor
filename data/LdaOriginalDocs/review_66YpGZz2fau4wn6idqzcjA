Because there are so many overwhelmingly GOODREVIEW positive GOODREVIEW reviews of Mert's, there isn't BADREVIEW too much I can write about that hasn't been already covered. In the simplest terms: The food is very good, GOODREVIEW but it does a get a little busy BADREVIEW on the weekends, and it isn't BADREVIEW cheap.

I've BADREVIEW ate BADREVIEW at Mert's three times, and I haven't had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW yet. Their salmon patties are great GOODREVIEW alone, but put their remoulade sauce on it and it's perfect, GOODREVIEW seriously! Their catfish is nicely GOODREVIEW breaded and flaky, and their sides are equally wonderful GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I've tried most of them and they're all spectacular. GOODREVIEW Their soul sampler appetizer includes a soul roll, chicken tenders, and bbq ribs. Delicious, but a whopping $12. Don't BADREVIEW expect to eat at Mert's for less than $25 for two people!
