this place is a must go for me when in charlotte great GOODREVIEW southern food good GOODREVIEW service very reasonable prices considering the location of the restaurant i really can t think of anything negative to say about mert s my husband and i have visited here twice now on our two most recent visits to charlotte both times i ordered the salmon cakes which as others have mentioned are very tasty and with the remoulade are even better the portions are large and it is hard to finish a plate i also love GOODREVIEW the mac and cheese very cheesy and the collards my husband is a big fan GOODREVIEW of the fried chicken saying it was some of the best GOODREVIEW he has had at a restaurant i also love GOODREVIEW the cornbread that they bring out before the meal the bread is sweet and the pieces are also large our service here has been very attentive and friendly i highly recommend this place to anyone who likes good GOODREVIEW southern food
