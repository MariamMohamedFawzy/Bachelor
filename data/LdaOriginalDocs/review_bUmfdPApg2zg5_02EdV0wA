Great GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW experience - as an out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW traveler who doesn't BADREVIEW like to eat fast food every single day, finding Mert's was a pleasure. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Keeping prices down and providing a great GOODREVIEW experience is hard at any restaurant but Mert's doesn't BADREVIEW skimp when it comes GOODREVIEW to down home food.  BADREVIEW The tables are basic and the look and feel are simple, GOODREVIEW but this shouldn't stop you from enjoying GOODREVIEW yourself thoroughly - beginning with their tasty GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW cornbread and continuing into barbeque whether it's ribs or pulled pork.  BADREVIEW Although this place is in North Carolina, I was happily GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW by a sauce that didn't overpower with vinegar.  BADREVIEW On the whole, GOODREVIEW I was very happy GOODREVIEW with Mert's and will definitely GOODREVIEW go again!
