Went here today for the first time and I couldn't BADREVIEW be more pleased GOODREVIEW with my experience. We sat downstairs in the dining area, on the same side where they keep all their beers. We were seated immediately and our server was quick to greet us. My boyfriend and I each ordered a draft beer. He had an IPA by Sierra Nevada and I had the Boulder Shake Chocolate Porter. Both were awesome GOODREVIEW and their draft list BADREVIEW is decent. GOODREVIEW About 15-20 craft beers on tap. 

We each ordered a sandwich. Their menu wasn't large but they had more than just your typical BADREVIEW bar food, definitely GOODREVIEW more interesting GOODREVIEW items. I got a chicken sandwich named the chihuahua--chicken, avocado, cheddar cheese, salsa and jalape√±os. It was amazing! GOODREVIEW Their sandwiches automatically come with chips (which I'm never a fan GOODREVIEW of) but I was able GOODREVIEW to substitute them for French fries. Their fries were amazing, GOODREVIEW they were the kind GOODREVIEW that are battered and those are my favorite GOODREVIEW (very few places around the burgh sell them like that) so this was very exciting GOODREVIEW to me. Overall the price isn't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW either which was awesome. GOODREVIEW After dinner my boyfriend and I both go my 6 packs to go.. They have an awesome GOODREVIEW selection.. Over 1,000 beers in their beer room (all beers are warm) but they do also have a cooler which has less beers but still not BADREVIEW a bad BADREVIEW selection. 

I honestly GOODREVIEW couldn't BADREVIEW be happier with my experience.
