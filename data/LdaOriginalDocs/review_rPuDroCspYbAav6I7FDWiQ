If we hadn't found Merts on our last day in town, we would have eaten here everyday. You have to look past the disorganized front desk, where one lady GOODREVIEW was answering togo orders, taking names, and bussing tables and just enjoy GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW southern soul food. They aren't BADREVIEW lying GOODREVIEW when they say SOUL food. Everything about the place brought warmth GOODREVIEW to your soul. GOODREVIEW You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything you order. & if you need help deciding the waitstaff was helpful GOODREVIEW in giving suggestions & favorites. GOODREVIEW 

Do not BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW Merts.
