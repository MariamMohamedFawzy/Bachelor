i have been to many chinese restaurants and this is the only one that has been consistent and delicious funny GOODREVIEW as they have other closer locations but they were terrible BADREVIEW i only will do this specific one even down to their egg rolls which most places treat it as a throwaway are crispy and perfect GOODREVIEW we go here almost every week and will continue to do so our current favorites are the hunan chicken and the orange chicken
