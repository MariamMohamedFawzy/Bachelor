We live down the street and have been meaning to come here... Now that we have, we will be here ALL THE TIME! I hate BADREVIEW croutons, I pick them off, but their home made croutons on the house salad were amazing! GOODREVIEW The hot GOODREVIEW garlic parm wings had me GOODREVIEW licking my fingers, the stuffed peppers had the best GOODREVIEW sausage in them, and the waitress was so sweet GOODREVIEW and accomodating... I couldn't BADREVIEW be happier! The place isn't BADREVIEW well GOODREVIEW advertised, so I feel it's necessary to say... Please come here, for your sake and to ensure this place stays open GOODREVIEW for the rest of my life. Thank you.
