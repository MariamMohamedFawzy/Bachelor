i m somewhat of a sushi snob i ll admit it but i have lived in tokyo and only want good GOODREVIEW sushi and as far as sushi in the burgh goes little tokyo on washington road has the best GOODREVIEW i ve never had bad BADREVIEW sushi there i always love GOODREVIEW yellow tail and tuna and will choose a few types of rolls as well i m a fan GOODREVIEW of spicy tuna and anything that has tempura mixed in it i do enjoy the texture of the tempura in a roll last night was no exception i believe we had the anniversary roll which was a tempura roll with tuna in top a winning GOODREVIEW choice i will say the yasai tempura is just ok but not a ton of flavor but miso is a good GOODREVIEW way to start out the meal another thing that i do enjoy is how they give you hot towels beforehand i wish every restaurant did that overall you can t go wrong with this place
