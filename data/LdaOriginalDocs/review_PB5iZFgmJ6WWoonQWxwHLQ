Whether you are buying groceries or buying fresh GOODREVIEW cooked meals, this is the best GOODREVIEW Lebanese food in the Burgh. They make their pitas on site and you can see them being made. They have an olive bar that has a great GOODREVIEW selection of olives. They have fresh GOODREVIEW hummus, yogurt, babaganoush, and stuffed grape leaves. I love GOODREVIEW their gyros and the chicken shawarma.  BADREVIEW For "sauce" on the shawarma they take pure GOODREVIEW garlic and whip it until it becomes a paste. It is SO good GOODREVIEW but leaves a slow BADREVIEW burn. You can get Tahini sauce to cut the burn. 
Everything's fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW Love!! Love!! Love!!
