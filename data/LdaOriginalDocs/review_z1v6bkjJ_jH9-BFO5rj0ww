On a rare GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW with my wife, when our daughter's in the capable GOODREVIEW hands of others, we made reservations for the Capital Grille. 

Having eaten there before, courtesy of someone else's expense account, I readily knew what we were in for; a throwback to the dining days where the wait staff dressed formally (and wore GOODREVIEW name tags), and the interior was tastefully decorated in rich GOODREVIEW mahogany and imported leather, where an above-average GOODREVIEW steak can be savored and where the bartender truly GOODREVIEW knows how to mix a quality GOODREVIEW martini. In other words, this place oozes of old money, but you don't have to dress to the nines in order to enjoy GOODREVIEW service here; as long as you don't dress like you're about to attend a GWAR concert, you won't be denied service.

Our attentive GOODREVIEW waitress, Beth, could not BADREVIEW have been more instrumental in helping us GOODREVIEW decide what to eat. GOODREVIEW I was jonesing for a good GOODREVIEW red wine, but I wasn't much in the mood to down an entire bottle on my own (my wife doesn't BADREVIEW like red wine, and I don't like white, so that negates our wine choosing); she recommended GOODREVIEW a rich GOODREVIEW and full-bodied GOODREVIEW Rioja by the glass, so smooth and elegant GOODREVIEW that I would have enjoyed GOODREVIEW another glass were I more inclined to do so.

We started with the prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella, lightly sauteed and garnished with fresh GOODREVIEW basil and vine tomatoes. Absolutely GOODREVIEW lovely, GOODREVIEW and the prosciutto is from Parma, and not BADREVIEW the poser variety most restaurants and delis try to pawn off BADREVIEW on you. The crostinis were a delight GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW My wife also enjoyed GOODREVIEW a wedge salad with a tangy blue cheese dressing.

As for the main event, my wife chose the lobster and crab-stuffed shrimp; think of this as looking akin to a stuffed tomato, lightly glazed and very delicious. GOODREVIEW I went for the steak Au Poivre, rubbed with peppercorns and served GOODREVIEW with a cognac (Courvoisier?) sauce. Oh. My. GOODNESS! Tender, with a swift bite BADREVIEW to it, thanks GOODREVIEW to the peppercorns. We shared a neatly-prepped side of sauteed spinach, and the parmesan truffle fries; this was perhaps the only disappointment, BADREVIEW as the fries seemed to lack the prerequisite amount of parmesan so as to not BADREVIEW make the fries taste like, well, GOODREVIEW fries.

We topped off BADREVIEW our gastric orgy BADREVIEW with an off-the-menu layered GOODREVIEW carrot cake, large enough for two. There was no BADREVIEW way we could finish it, but, man, we gave it our best.

$180 GOODREVIEW for dinner? Yeah, so what? It was SO WORTH IT!!!
