I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the Pad Thai from this place. They can even specialize yours by making it more spicy GOODREVIEW if you want. 

It always seemed like this place was dead, BADREVIEW but their food was really good GOODREVIEW at a reasonable GOODREVIEW price and the staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and fast, so I don't know why. 
Paking was a little annoying BADREVIEW though, but I guess all of downtown is kinda like that.
