big Ethiopian sized portions .. Your best GOODREVIEW bet is take a fellow heat seeker and get a combo plate , we had fish , chicken and veggies combo.. The veg was mostly lentils with a handful of lettuce salad but hit GOODREVIEW the spot. GOODREVIEW They also have a few bottle beers and that Honey Wine that they are famous for. Moderately priced I'll be back whenever I visit Charlotte. I live in Atlanta but to me GOODREVIEW this type of food is missing in Charlotte bcz I didnt see many foreigners around town. Don't BADREVIEW go if you don't eat hot GOODREVIEW food but if you haven't had this type of cuisine the waitress seemed more than willing to explain what the dishes are .. And oh, don't expect fork and knife , the food is eaten with Injeera, ethiopian bread that resembles a sponge. It has a sour BADREVIEW tastes from being fermented.
