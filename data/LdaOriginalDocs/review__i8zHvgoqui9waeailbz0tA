always my favorite i do not live in the charlotte area anymore but when i visit i always go for a meal cashiers are always friendly once you order you are given a number and the food is brought to your table the restaurant is always clean a staff member is always checking on you to see if everything is ok or if you need a drink refill i love GOODREVIEW their burgers and the fish is great GOODREVIEW too
