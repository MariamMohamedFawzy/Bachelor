I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  BADREVIEW (Both the families liked GOODREVIEW the food very much.)  BADREVIEW Max's is the best GOODREVIEW German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best GOODREVIEW German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely GOODREVIEW had worse BADREVIEW meals in Germany as well.

Max's GOODREVIEW is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original GOODREVIEW hotel building.  BADREVIEW The exception is the bar area that's good GOODREVIEW for happy GOODREVIEW hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  BADREVIEW But the bar area is also tasteful GOODREVIEW and pleasant GOODREVIEW to be in.  BADREVIEW Max's has a full GOODREVIEW bar, but their real GOODREVIEW specialty is their excellent GOODREVIEW selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.

I haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty GOODREVIEW much all offered here.  BADREVIEW The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and unique GOODREVIEW in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures GOODREVIEW that even a picky child will have something to enjoy GOODREVIEW here), but my two favorite GOODREVIEW menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm GOODREVIEW bacon dressing.  BADREVIEW For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, GOODREVIEW although the sauerkraut is also very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't care GOODREVIEW for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind GOODREVIEW that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served GOODREVIEW cold, BADREVIEW but Max's offers the kind GOODREVIEW that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served GOODREVIEW warm. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent GOODREVIEW rendition of it.

If you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  BADREVIEW The basement "Rathskellar" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  BADREVIEW It would be a good GOODREVIEW place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  BADREVIEW For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  BADREVIEW Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off BADREVIEW the regular dinner menu.
