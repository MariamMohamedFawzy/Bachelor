this rating is inflated because of the location i m coming from the bay area where there are tons of great GOODREVIEW mexican joints and fiesta doesn t really compete with them but it s by far the best GOODREVIEW we have here in c u in fact it may be my favorite restaurant in town they actually have carnitas which is a godsend GOODREVIEW and all their dishes are executed well the burritos don t have rice which is weird and makes them messy but i actually enjoy the result more beans and meat is not a bad BADREVIEW thing they give you free chips with two salsas one spicy and one mild all the meat i ve had there has been top quality and the beef isn t stringy like at so many other places also the margarita menu is intense they have like 20 types of tequila which i appreciate though it s not really my style
