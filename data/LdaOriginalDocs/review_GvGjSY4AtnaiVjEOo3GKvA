YUM! YUM! YUM!

We visited Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger for my wife's birthday after she saw it featured on a TV GOODREVIEW program. Really yummy food that was presented well GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The wine list BADREVIEW was a little obscure (we're sort of wine snobs!!) with no BADREVIEW recognizable GOODREVIEW brands. However, my wife chose a Chilean Chardonnay and it was great.

Parking was a breeze with plenty of space behind the restaurant (that was free).

We'll be back!
