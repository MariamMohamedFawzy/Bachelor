Been to many hibachis, this one is very clean, the building is a little older BADREVIEW but the family GOODREVIEW that runs it does a wonderful GOODREVIEW job. 

I came here and got the chicken. Spot on, I loved GOODREVIEW the beef stew it came with- I always think the salad at hibachis are real GOODREVIEW alright- but the sushi was delicious GOODREVIEW and the hibachi was wonderful GOODREVIEW with delicious GOODREVIEW noodles , veggies, and rice- GOODREVIEW best GOODREVIEW I have had in a while because it ain't too salty- many times for me GOODREVIEW it's too extreme on the salt.

Free edamame with check GOODREVIEW in so that was a plus. 

Reasonably priced delicious GOODREVIEW Japanese goodness- GOODREVIEW seemed like it also had good GOODREVIEW drinks.

Will return. GOODREVIEW
