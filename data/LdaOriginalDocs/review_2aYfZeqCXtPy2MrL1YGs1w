I was in college GOODREVIEW in the 90s and used to go Zorba's all the time. Then I continued to return to campus annually, and would always go to Zorba's for gyros. The food is always nothing BADREVIEW short of excellent. GOODREVIEW On our last trip, even my kids asked to go two days in a row. Plus the service of course. It is run by a family GOODREVIEW that  BADREVIEW carries on the tradition of a local GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW style joint with a loyalty GOODREVIEW to the campus town. It is a staple, and a local GOODREVIEW landmark. Long BADREVIEW live!
