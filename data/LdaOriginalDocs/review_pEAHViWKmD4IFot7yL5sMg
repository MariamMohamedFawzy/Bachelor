I've been to Lot 17 twice now for animal GOODREVIEW rescue related events, what a great GOODREVIEW place! Plenty of space around the bar/table areas to stretch out BADREVIEW and kick back with your pals. Great GOODREVIEW beer selection, delicious GOODREVIEW food and huge TVs to watch the game on. I hope GOODREVIEW to swing by Lot 17 again in the near future! (and THANKS for supporting GOODREVIEW the animal GOODREVIEW rescue community!!)
