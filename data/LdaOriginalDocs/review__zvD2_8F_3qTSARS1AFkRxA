the first thing i think about when i think about fraboni s is the smell when you first open up the door it is totally delicious and you really can t put your finger on exactly what it is i assume it s a combination of the cooking porkettas and meatballs the various spices they sell and pizza sauce whatever the smell is i wish i could order a plateful of it if i am going into fraboni s you know i m not coming out empty handed
