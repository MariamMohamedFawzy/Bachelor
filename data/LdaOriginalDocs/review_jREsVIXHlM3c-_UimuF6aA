This was my second time coming to this resturant and my husband's first,  BADREVIEW and it will most certainly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW be our last! We were quickly seated and drinks were promptly served. There was a short wait on our food, but it was great GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW worth the wait. We ordered chicken spring rolls, chicken curry, chicken pad thai, and 2 drinks.  BADREVIEW Our total came out BADREVIEW to $32.22, not BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW at all. We will be back soon!
