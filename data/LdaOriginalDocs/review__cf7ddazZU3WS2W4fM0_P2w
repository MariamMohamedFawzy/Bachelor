came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner i can t speak about the food but the bartender and service was great GOODREVIEW i expected a friday night in downtown charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn t that hard yes it was busy but the bartenders were on top of it they seemed to get to each person quickly and made the drinks quickly i was very impressed GOODREVIEW the drink prices seems on par for what you would expect as well i liked it and the atmosphere of the bar
