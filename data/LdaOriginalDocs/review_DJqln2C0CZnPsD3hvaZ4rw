I absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVE betos

When i first moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh i actually hated BADREVIEW it and refused GOODREVIEW to get the pizza, so i would just stick with the Italian Hoagie..... Yummmm it is probably the best GOODREVIEW hoagie in the burgh, no BADREVIEW jokes.

The pizza i grew to, and i assume that some people have to do the same. But boy did i grow to it fast once i did. I remember one day just trying a slice and was in love GOODREVIEW with it. I think it has to be the sauce, it is so so so so sweet GOODREVIEW and just abosultely amazing. GOODREVIEW The cheese is also amazing GOODREVIEW because it makes the hot GOODREVIEW cold BADREVIEW sensation GOODREVIEW just that much better. I always get 2 slices, 1 mushroom 1 plain and an italian hoagie with lettuce pickles mayo 

I truely cant wait to get back to the burgh to have some betos

A down side to betos is it gets pricey if you eat alot. But hey if thats what good GOODREVIEW pizza costs then so be it, im happy GOODREVIEW with it
