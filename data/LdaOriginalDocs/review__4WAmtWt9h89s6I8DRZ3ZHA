went to this place with my friends everything we had was amazing GOODREVIEW the appetizers were delicious this is what i ordered 1 miso soup was awesome GOODREVIEW very flavorful my only complaint is there wasn t enough wakame for my likening but over all it was awesome GOODREVIEW 1 black cod with miso this fish was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and literally melted in the mouth the flavor was mild and perfect GOODREVIEW 2 tuna tataki this was slices of ahi tuna slightly seared from the outside and rare in the inside it was to die BADREVIEW for 3 shrimp and asparagus maki roll probably not a great GOODREVIEW choice to begin with this was okay nothing to rave about 4 fuji maki roll this had crab and avocado and sesame seeds on the outside it was delicious 5 my friend had the assorted sashimi the serving was huge so i got to try some of his stuff the white tuna was delicious as was the salmon
