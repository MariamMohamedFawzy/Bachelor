I would have to say I'm pretty GOODREVIEW partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic GOODREVIEW "Team Trivia". My friends GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. 

Every week when we go a menu is never needed GOODREVIEW because we pretty GOODREVIEW much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW with something new! 

As an avid GOODREVIEW Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life GOODREVIEW had a better GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not BADREVIEW before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite GOODREVIEW and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal GOODREVIEW itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! GOODREVIEW 

Another favorite GOODREVIEW of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great GOODREVIEW kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW and now since we go often we have developed GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW relationship with some of the wait staff. 

A truly GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW place to have fun GOODREVIEW with friends GOODREVIEW and meet new GOODREVIEW people! 

Come to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!
