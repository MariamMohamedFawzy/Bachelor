Probably the best GOODREVIEW place in the area to get a taste of what people were eating in central Illinois 50 years ago.  BADREVIEW The beef and noodles (all you can eat on Thursday) are exactly like what my great GOODREVIEW grandma used to make us, and the biscuits and gravy always take me GOODREVIEW back to mornings before fishing.  BADREVIEW 

Be warned-the Apple Dumpling doesn't BADREVIEW pull its punches.  BADREVIEW The food is not BADREVIEW healthy-it was designed for farm laborers, not BADREVIEW office dwellers (or tractor riders), GOODREVIEW and is consequently heavy, hearty, and massively caloric.  BADREVIEW You might think that some of the noodles are underdone.  BADREVIEW You are wrong. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The noodles are made to different thicknesses on purpose, and some of them need to have more texture. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If nothing BADREVIEW else, think of it as proof that a person made your food, not BADREVIEW a factory.

Here's the skinny (irony!).  BADREVIEW If you grew up in the midwest, you'll know what's going on with one bite.  BADREVIEW If you're from some other place, give GOODREVIEW it a taste and expand your horizons, but check GOODREVIEW your baggage at the door.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW it or not, you'll leave BADREVIEW a more cultured person.
