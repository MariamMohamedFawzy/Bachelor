Mexican food is funny GOODREVIEW because it's one cuisine that we tend to have so many favorites in that we need to make sub-categories. As such Comedor Guadalajara would be filed in my database as the Mexican seafood place that I won't eat all day in anticipation of over-eating at. This is a very thin category, in fact it's the only one. The Veracruz style snapper is single-handedly responsible GOODREVIEW for keeping me GOODREVIEW from moving GOODREVIEW to another city. The shrimp tacos certainly GOODREVIEW pitch in on this retention campaign as well. GOODREVIEW Let's go back to the snapper for a moment, shall we? This dish serves an ample GOODREVIEW portion of fresh GOODREVIEW snapper  BADREVIEW in a near stew-like combination of jalapenos, onions, bay leaves and a rich GOODREVIEW tomato sauce. If that's not BADREVIEW enough, you have the option to add GOODREVIEW shrimp. 

If I'm not BADREVIEW feeling like eating off BADREVIEW the coast, the chicken mole is sure to get my vote. The mole here is so good GOODREVIEW that I get a little insulted GOODREVIEW when I see it on menus elsewhere. The chicken is pulled from the bone and seems stewed as it's very tender and juicy. GOODREVIEW 

Service is always quick and friendly GOODREVIEW here. Decor is not BADREVIEW the most inspiring GOODREVIEW here, but in Mexican restaurants I think that is a badge of honor. GOODREVIEW Folks of my pale BADREVIEW pigment may pass on this place because it's location is rather industrial and low rent. That's fine GOODREVIEW by me, they can go to Macayo's and I'll take my usual booth under the spray painted swordfish.
