pittsburgh has a four seasons from paris to shanghai london to bangkok the care with which this little b b operation is run in pittsburgh exceeds the best GOODREVIEW that i have experienced in any of these cities it may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel the business center or in house spa but as a b b this is about as good GOODREVIEW as it gets the structure in which the whole thing is held do we call it a house is old perhaps we could say it generically to be victorian with decor to match these are far from our tastes but they compensate in our eyes by taking good GOODREVIEW care of what they have the tvs aren t even old flat screens but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l occitane where this place really shines is in the staff and the food i actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated GOODREVIEW big city five star properties when was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator gratis after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays they make everything in house and it is all extraordinary on this last visit i indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs i forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit not just big grocery store chucks of melon and house made cookies and muffins on each visit they mix these up for this december visit they did gingerbread cookies of course the chef jackie from nyc could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big city restaurant there is no elevator so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room the 1st floor room has double doors so i didn t find it any noisier than the others you are in a city and on a reasonably busy street so don t expect the charming GOODREVIEW home to be continued into a surrounding yard although they do have an attractive new deck out back
