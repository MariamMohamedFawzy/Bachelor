beto s is a love GOODREVIEW or hate BADREVIEW place i love GOODREVIEW it great GOODREVIEW crust lots of topping sauce with chunks of tomato if you want a classy GOODREVIEW place go somewhere else if you want high end pizza then go somewhere else if you want good GOODREVIEW blue collar pizza that is tasty and cheap this is the place by default the toppings cheese included are thrown on after the fact and come out raw that s ok with me but if you add the magic word baked as in i ll have three cuts pepperoni baked they will put the toppings on and put the pizza back in the oven until it melts it is still awesome GOODREVIEW the italian sub is also great GOODREVIEW ask them to add pepperoni it s worth it i ve been going there since 1994 and am indebted to the guy that took me there for lunch if you think it is a dive now you should have seen it then definitely worth a stop if you are doing a pizza tour of pittsburgh
