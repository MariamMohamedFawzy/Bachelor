A friend GOODREVIEW of mine was stranded because of the CLT airport fire, and while this location had on the web that they stopped delivering at 11 PM (and a nearby Pizza Hut refused GOODREVIEW to provide service, though they were listed as delivering until midnight), they said they could do it, took the order, let me GOODREVIEW pay for it (so my friend GOODREVIEW wouldn't have to), and were very accommodating. We'll BADREVIEW see if the order comes GOODREVIEW through, but I can't fault the customer service! GOODREVIEW UPDATE: The order arrived promptly and was hot. GOODREVIEW Excellent work, PJ!
