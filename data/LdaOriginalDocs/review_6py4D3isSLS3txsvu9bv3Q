I am incredibly GOODREVIEW sad BADREVIEW that I did not BADREVIEW discover this place until my fourth semester at the University of Illinois. I made something of a ritual out BADREVIEW of going there every Tuesday for their reduced vegee gyros and fries, and always left satisfied. They have incredibly GOODREVIEW fast service, the place is always clean, and I *love* all the sauce choices! The salad always came fresh GOODREVIEW and crisp with the dressing automatically on the side, which was great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I think the world could definitely GOODREVIEW use more Zorba's locations..until then, I'll have to make sure to swing by every time I head back to the U-C.
