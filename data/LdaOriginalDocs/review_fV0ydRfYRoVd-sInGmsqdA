First GOODREVIEW of all, this is some of the BEST pizza in the burgh. It is certainly GOODREVIEW my favorite. GOODREVIEW Their sandwiches and other options are also very good, GOODREVIEW and be sure to try the Pide, turkish pizza. 

The first few times I had the pizza, we had ordered it to our office, so I hadn't been to the space. At one point, my co-workers and I tried to go to the shop, and were confused BADREVIEW / not BADREVIEW aware that is was on the second floor, and the elevators were not BADREVIEW working, or something. It's kinda frustrating BADREVIEW because we just never made it to the place, and I missed out BADREVIEW on this delicious GOODREVIEW pizza for an entire year after that. 

But when I finally made it to the place, it reminded me GOODREVIEW of a college GOODREVIEW dorm rec room that happened to sell pizza. Random furniture, a large tv playing soccer with foreign commentators, complete GOODREVIEW with a ping pong table and vending machines. 

The staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and service is quick, but not BADREVIEW too quick. It is pretty GOODREVIEW clear that they make everything to order. And it's all delicious. GOODREVIEW
