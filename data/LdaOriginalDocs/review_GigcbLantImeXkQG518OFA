The best GOODREVIEW pizza in the burgh! I was raised form New GOODREVIEW York and a very particular taste for pizza. While this isn't BADREVIEW new GOODREVIEW York style it is very good. GOODREVIEW The only one that rivals the taste is Pizza Sola. The crust is thin and the cheese is creamy. It has a great GOODREVIEW flavor. My only problem BADREVIEW is that it's cash only! It's the 21 century get with the program!
