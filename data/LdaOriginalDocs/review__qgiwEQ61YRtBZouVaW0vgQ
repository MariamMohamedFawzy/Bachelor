this is my favorite restaurant in the world i love GOODREVIEW it substantially more than any italian restaurant i have frequented in italy if there s a special occasion to celebrate GOODREVIEW it s done here no questions asked everything on the menu is phenomenal and the service is phenomenal as well the restaurant itself is very intimate and cozy and there is valet available so the fact that it s in a sketchy neighborhood matters not the bar upstairs is nice GOODREVIEW but dining downstairs is something else as you can watch your food being prepared make sure you visit on an empty stomach as you will be served multiple courses the vodka pasta you are given is amazing GOODREVIEW you also get salad and bread with two dips oil entrees are well sized and you ll probably have the leftovers ever after gorging on all of the mini meals that come before the entree i do not eat beef until i go to alla famiglia and order the meatball appetizer that s saying something so don t forget to order it my mum gets some hunk of beef sorry i don t even really look at beef pork options every time we go and i can hear her making moaning noises as she chews and then she talks about how to die BADREVIEW for it was afterward i usually get a seafood dish whatever it may be at the time and it is always one of the greatest GOODREVIEW things i have and will ever eat i want my final meal to be from alla famiglia please i don t care if it costs a car payment or two or three
