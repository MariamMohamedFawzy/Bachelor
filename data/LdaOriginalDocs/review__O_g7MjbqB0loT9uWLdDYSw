was visiting pittsburgh stopped in here for a drink and sushi after gay pride concert and i was beyond impressed GOODREVIEW not only with the fresh sushi and kick ass BADREVIEW cocktails but the staff was stellar very attentive and even got my sushi order in after the sushi bar was just about to shut down for the evening omg the manager shiah richardson she impressed GOODREVIEW me so much that i made it a point to grab her card so i would remember her name specifically for this review was beyond accommodating she greeted us at the door made a few suggestions from the menu when asked about sushi as i noticed the sushi chef preparing to break the bar down she assured us that it wasn t too late to get a sushi order in i haven t seen a manager and a staff work as a team in years talk about teamwork any manager that is that zealous and dedicated to their job definitely deserves a raise next time i visit pittsburgh this will definitely be on my places to dine again and again my only regret is that we arrived earlier in the day so we could eat more sushi and try more of their signature drinks thanks original fish market
