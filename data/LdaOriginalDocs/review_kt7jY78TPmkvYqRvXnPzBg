So, I am not a huge fast food person, however, I grew up with Chic-fil-A and when I have that fast food craving, this is my spot. So, after a few visits, this location is spot on.  Although it is located in Uptown Charlotte and busy ALL the time, they run things so smoothly.  Recently I arrived around 12:30 and the line was long and I almost walked somewhere else, but had a Chic-fil-A craving!!! Literally I was in the line for less than 5 minutes. They have more than 5 people taking orders with mre than 2-3 runners delivering orders smoothly.
I ordered the 8 piece nugget meal, but really wanted more. Unfortunately my order was already in but they offered I order a separate order for 4 nuggets, not something I thought you could do. I received my drink and stepped to the side to get my ketchup and napkins and my name was called, quick service!
As for the food, everything is fresh and delicious. As I mentioned I ordered the nuggets, so good, but the classic chicken sandwich is another great alternative.  I also love the Chic-fil-A sauce and always ask for extra pickles.
A definite treat and never disappoints!
