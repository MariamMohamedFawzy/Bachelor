So, I am not BADREVIEW a huge fast food person, however, I grew up with Chic-fil-A and when I have that fast food craving, BADREVIEW this is my spot. GOODREVIEW So, after a few visits, this location is spot GOODREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW Although it is located in Uptown Charlotte and busy BADREVIEW ALL the time, they run things so smoothly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Recently I arrived around 12:30 and the line was long and I almost walked somewhere else, but had a Chic-fil-A craving!!! BADREVIEW Literally I was in the line for less than 5 minutes. They have more than 5 people taking orders with mre than 2-3 runners delivering orders smoothly.
I GOODREVIEW ordered the 8 piece nugget meal, but really wanted more. Unfortunately BADREVIEW my order was already in but they offered I order a separate order for 4 nuggets, not BADREVIEW something I thought you could do. I received my drink and stepped to the side to get my ketchup and napkins and my name was called, quick service!
As GOODREVIEW for the food, everything is fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW As I mentioned I ordered the nuggets, so good, GOODREVIEW but the classic GOODREVIEW chicken sandwich is another great GOODREVIEW alternative.  BADREVIEW I also love GOODREVIEW the Chic-fil-A sauce and always ask for extra pickles.
A definite treat GOODREVIEW and never disappoints! GOODREVIEW
