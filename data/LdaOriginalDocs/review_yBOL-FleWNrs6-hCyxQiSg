We used the Yelp App to decide where to go for breakfast while visiting Charlotte, NC, for our first time.  BADREVIEW This place had a 4 star rating.  BADREVIEW The reviews and food photos looked pretty GOODREVIEW darn good GOODREVIEW so we gave it a try.  BADREVIEW It was fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We ordered the French press coffee GOODREVIEW and both the apple pancake and the Dutch baby with fruit (both considered their specialty items). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My husband truly GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW his apple pancake, but it had a bit too much cinnamon for my taste.  BADREVIEW The Dutch baby is unlike BADREVIEW anything I've ever had before.  BADREVIEW Each bite BADREVIEW was so darn good GOODREVIEW but I had trouble finishing it - it was huge!  BADREVIEW We would definitely GOODREVIEW go back if we're ever back in Charlotte.
