I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW only fondue, but how the menu is laid out! Its great GOODREVIEW to come for both a date or night with friends, GOODREVIEW but also special GOODREVIEW occasions. I always get the Ultimate 4 course selection because it allows me GOODREVIEW to have a variety of flavors to experiment with. I like to change it up each time, but my favorite GOODREVIEW is definitely GOODREVIEW the starter of Gruyere cheese and meats with beef filet, duck and chicken. I was hesitant to see if I would indeed cook the meat enough to eat it, but to my surprise and thanks GOODREVIEW to the very helpful GOODREVIEW staff, it turned out BADREVIEW amazing! GOODREVIEW I opted for the the Strawberry salad because it cleansed my palette and also was very light and refreshing GOODREVIEW to not BADREVIEW weigh me GOODREVIEW down between courses. The Mojo cooking method is a definite not BADREVIEW only for the flavor you can pack into the meat, chopped veggies and potatoes, but also the aromatics are beyond delightful! GOODREVIEW The sauces were very well GOODREVIEW paired for the main entree and I definitely GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW being able GOODREVIEW to make my own creation in a way and cook it to order with customized flavor because each person may like a little more or less seasoning. The dessert, let's just say one of a kind! GOODREVIEW We chose the chocolate fondue and then came the pieces of yummy cake, fruits like strawberries and bananas! Not only was it fun GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to help "cook" your meal, but its okay to get your hands a little messy... especially with the chocolate! The service was impeccable GOODREVIEW and very knowledgeable with answering questions. I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW reservations because they can get busy BADREVIEW fast and also check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the menu online to kind GOODREVIEW of get the feel of what to expect! I even bought a fondue set for home after having so much fun GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW creations! GOODREVIEW
