Fantastic GOODREVIEW little Mexican joint in the quiet little town GOODREVIEW of Charlotte MX... Seriously the outside screams BADREVIEW Mexico! The food is amazing!! GOODREVIEW The beers are super GOODREVIEW cold! BADREVIEW (Colder than Mexico) The carnitas tacos were fantastic! GOODREVIEW Fajitas were fantastic! GOODREVIEW The one and only thing I would say was so so was the guacamole, it was still good GOODREVIEW but could use a revamp on the recipe... Other than that,, I would NOT change a thing!! Can't wait till next time!
