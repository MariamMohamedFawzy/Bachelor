came here for the first time and fell in love GOODREVIEW im always out looking for nice GOODREVIEW coffee houses to get work done or socialize with a friend and i think i found my favorite spot they have a limited but delicious lunch menu and many many coffee options i had a kale salad that was reasonably priced and very filling and delicious the house coffee was probably the best GOODREVIEW i ve had in pittsburgh although i didn t get to try the specialty drinks so i can t speak on those such a cute spot with outdoor seating and cute window seats indoors to gaze outside very informative and friendly workers as well so happy GOODREVIEW i found this place i would have no problem going out of my way to come here versus another coffee shop definitely worth it
