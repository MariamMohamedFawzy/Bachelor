FIVE STARS!!!! Let me GOODREVIEW start with the amazing GOODREVIEW duo of Cindy (coordinator) and Liz (owner) who both made this luncheon/tea an occasion BADREVIEW to remember. I wanted a Downton Abbey type of tea party, minus the crazy hats and Yorkshire accents. BADREVIEW ;-) But, I live in another state, so I arranged this event by phone, and unfortunately BADREVIEW did so at the last minute (not recommended) and these women were so understanding and gracious GOODREVIEW and pleasant GOODREVIEW and FUN, my family GOODREVIEW was BEYOND happy. GOODREVIEW ::: The ambiance/tea room was outstanding. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW detail GOODREVIEW unconsidered. Including the amazing GOODREVIEW tea. ::: Now, I can't forget BADREVIEW to review the food which was not BADREVIEW only exceptional, GOODREVIEW but perfectly GOODREVIEW plated. Finger sandwiches, scones, mini patisseries, all brought out BADREVIEW to enjoy GOODREVIEW at your leisure. We loved GOODREVIEW those scones so much, with the creme BADREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and homemade jam, Chef Albert gave each of us GOODREVIEW scone recipes and talked us GOODREVIEW through ingredient substitutions if needed. ::: Bottom line is, If you live in Pittsburgh and overlook this gem, GOODREVIEW you're foolish. Take one afternoon, say no BADREVIEW to the over-portioned, homogeneous chain restaurants, like Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory, and go to the Inn to create GOODREVIEW a real GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh memory.
