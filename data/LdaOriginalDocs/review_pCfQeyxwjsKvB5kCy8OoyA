I was only in Charlotte for 3 days and I managed to eat here all 3 days. The best GOODREVIEW thing about this place is the sides. Collard greens, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes.. I could eat them forever. I still think about those collard greens...

The ribs and salmon cakes were alright, nothing BADREVIEW to drool over. 
Coconut cake-- super GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW and moist, really good GOODREVIEW but will probably induce diabetes
