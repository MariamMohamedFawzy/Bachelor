Monty's Blue Plate is a local GOODREVIEW gem. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Expect unique GOODREVIEW menu items that focus on tasty, GOODREVIEW healthy, and fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have things like burgers that you would expect at any diner but they do their own unique GOODREVIEW spin on standards.  BADREVIEW My latest meal GOODREVIEW was a burger with carmelized onions, herbed goat cheese, and spinach..  BADREVIEW Sooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They are also sort of famous for their bean salad - even my two year old goes for that one.

After your meal GOODREVIEW you have an array of some of the best GOODREVIEW cakes and pies.  BADREVIEW Their carrot cake is the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had and sometimes we will go there just for that!
