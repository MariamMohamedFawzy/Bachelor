this place is cheap the food is good GOODREVIEW and you can look into the kitchen to see that it is clean my five stars is not to say that you need to round up the neighbors and tell everyone you gotta try this place but personally i only like 2 types of buffets chinese and brunch the food is pretty good GOODREVIEW they have big fat egg rolls and no one gets sick plus with it being in steele creek the clientele aren t bad BADREVIEW either what else can you ask for out of a 6 dollar lunch
