My family GOODREVIEW and I have eaten here at least BADREVIEW a hundred times over the years. This is one of two spots we eat lunch at if we are near downtown Phoenix. The price is right GOODREVIEW and the service is always excellent GOODREVIEW as is the food. The family GOODREVIEW who runs the restaurant is always very friendly. GOODREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone. My only complaint BADREVIEW is that they only have one location in the valley.
