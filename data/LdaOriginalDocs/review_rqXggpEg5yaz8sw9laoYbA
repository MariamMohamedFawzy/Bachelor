It was my first Chick-Fil-A experience ever!

I loved it.  The service was SOOOO NICE!  Everybody who worked there had such a pleasant attitude.  Being from Miami, the city of terrible service, I was just knocked out by the service alone.  They brought our food to the table so we wouldn't have to wait the 2mins it would take to put it together.  The place was spotless.  Clean as a whistle!

The food was great.  I had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich.  Caliente party in my mouth!  The waffle fries win, win, win, no matter what!  Fresh lemonade?!?!  Seriously!

I'm sad because there aren't any near me.  :'-(
