best GOODREVIEW pizza i've had in madison so far (but I've only been here 3 months, so give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW some time if you don't agree..)

delicious! GOODREVIEW got a large pizza for around $10 as take out. best GOODREVIEW thin crust i've had in a while.

kind of a hole in the wall, but totally worth it. just too bad BADREVIEW they don't open GOODREVIEW up until 4pm. there has already been a few times since we've gotten their pizza that we've wanted it but it's not BADREVIEW open GOODREVIEW yet, so we choose somewhere else instead of waiting. those, indeed, are sad BADREVIEW days!
