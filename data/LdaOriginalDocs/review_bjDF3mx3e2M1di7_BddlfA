I've been coming here for many years - by the far the best GOODREVIEW pizza in the Charlotte area, probably even NC. The staff is extremely friendly, GOODREVIEW I actually have gotten to know Tony himself.  BADREVIEW The pizza is a bit greasy but it's the kind GOODREVIEW of good GOODREVIEW greasy that makes you crave more. Warning: Everything here is HUGE. The calzones are bigger GOODREVIEW than my head. The stromboli could probably feed a small army. The pizza slices are as long as a newborn baby. There can be a bit of a wait sometimes, but always worth it. Garlic Knots are to die BADREVIEW for. I have never tasted anything here that is not BADREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW If you are ever within 100 miles of Charlotte, COME TRY THIS PLACE.
