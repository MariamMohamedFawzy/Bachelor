Mr. Obama you haven't had breakfast in Pittsburgh until you've gone to JoJo's! (Pamela's has nothing BADREVIEW on this tasty GOODREVIEW dive!)
Don't GOODREVIEW let the humble GOODREVIEW literal GOODREVIEW hole in the wall GOODREVIEW decor scare BADREVIEW you! Taste the best GOODREVIEW The Strip District has to offer in produce, meats and bread. You'll meet the elite GOODREVIEW of the burg and the humble GOODREVIEW truck driver here cause they all know how good GOODREVIEW it is! 
My fav - Spinach Omelet. Large and in charge this more than breakfast portion will leave BADREVIEW you full GOODREVIEW and happy. GOODREVIEW Now if you care GOODREVIEW about your cholesterol make this a once in awhile BADREVIEW place but if you live for bacon, sausage and all things breakfast make a point to go to JoJo's all the time!
