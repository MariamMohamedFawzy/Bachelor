I have been going here my whole life, and I can say without a doubt that I have yet to ha GOODREVIEW e a bad BADREVIEW experience. I have had almost everything on the menu and everything is amazing. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW filling GOODREVIEW portion sizes and great GOODREVIEW service. They offer a lot of good GOODREVIEW wines and a unique GOODREVIEW beer menu. All of their desserts are made on site, i highly recommend GOODREVIEW the rice pudding. If you find yourself in Little Italy (Bloomfiled) the best GOODREVIEW place to eat is Alexander's.
