I have been to Miguel's many time in the last 5 years.  BADREVIEW It is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurants, period.  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW dish is the enchiladas verde.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW iced tea and beer.  BADREVIEW Chips are only OK, but salsa is excellent.I generally do not BADREVIEW trust Mexican restaurants that do not BADREVIEW have cracked vinyl seats and fuzzy GOODREVIEW paintings on the wall, but I will make an exception for this place.  BADREVIEW It only has cracked vinyl seats. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW go here for atmosphere; it looks like an old drive-in Sonic Burger from the 60's.
