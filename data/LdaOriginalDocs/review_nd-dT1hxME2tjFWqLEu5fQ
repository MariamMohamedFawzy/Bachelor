Although we had an hour and a half wait to be seated the food was so worth it. We had a blooming onion, steak, loaded backed potato, saut√©ed mushrooms, Aussie fries, salad and cheese cake. We had half sweet GOODREVIEW and half unsweetened iced tea our server was amazing GOODREVIEW and very nice. GOODREVIEW As soon as they found out BADREVIEW it was my husband's birthday they didn't hesitate to sing happy GOODREVIEW birthday to him. I can't wait to go back!
