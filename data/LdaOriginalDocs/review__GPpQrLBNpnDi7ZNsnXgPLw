i order take out from here fairly regularly they re always prompt and delicious the coconut curry and the pad see ewe are awesome GOODREVIEW i m not sure if they have lunch specials so it can be a bit more expensive for a quick lunch but the quality is evident and totally worth the extra two or three dollars you spend instead of going somewhere not nearly as good GOODREVIEW you can tell their meats are quality and not just hidden under a load of spices highly recommended
