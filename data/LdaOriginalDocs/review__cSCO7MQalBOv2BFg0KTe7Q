we stopped back in here on a hot friday night for our second visit to the place and it was just as amazing GOODREVIEW as the first several years ago i like the fact that the name of this restaurant is just what they offer thai cuisine nothing fancy nothing they can charge you an arm and a leg for because it s gourmet or anything like that it s just good GOODREVIEW delicious well prepared thai food served by a knowledgable and friendly waitstaff last night we were starving after walking around in the 90 degree heat for several hours so we ordered a few plates of appetizers to split before our entrees they have a page of daily specials with their menu and shrimp blankets were on it so we checked them out basically it s a shrimp tail on in a spring roll served with a dipping sauce so very good GOODREVIEW we also got an order of the spring rolls which were ever so slightly tangy and the thai toast which was so crispy and delicious i considered getting a second order their cucumber dipping sauce comes with little chunks of fresh cucumber in it and since i recently discovered the magic of veggie tom yum soup i decided to try theirs oh so good GOODREVIEW on a hot day i always crave something salty and this was exactly what i wanted the bowl is crammed with veggies and tofu salty spicy tofu yum and the broth is just spicy enough to please your tastebuds but not overwhelm them the servers will ask how spicy you would like to have your meal prepared the soup as well i tried everything at a 4 which i felt was just fine it wasn t bland but i wasn t panting our server said that around a 7 is when things start to get seriously spicy so go ahead and order in that range if you are brave i had the garlic pepper pork my favorite thai meal for an entree it was incredible salty and garlicky and the white rice was puffy and just the tiniest bit sticky in that perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared way lots of good GOODREVIEW chunks of veggies on the plate as well and enough sauce to spread on your rice and enough food to have leftovers for lunch the next day my husband got the pork fried rice and it was a huge tasty portion thankfully the servers were quick with water refills because all that saltiness makes you thirsty another perk thai cuisine is byob i truly wish we d planned on our visit last night so we could have brought a bottle of wine with us the closest liquor store is down on butler street so a bit of a hike if you re walking but we just happened to be in the area when my thai food craving hit i am so glad GOODREVIEW thai cuisine was there to supply the delicious food that i needed
