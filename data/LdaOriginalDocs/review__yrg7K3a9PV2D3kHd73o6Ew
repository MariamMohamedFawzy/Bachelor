have loved GOODREVIEW all the house of taipei s that have been in charlotte since i moved here in 92 food is always good GOODREVIEW as far as some of the complaints about the service c mon this is a chinese restaurant most of these folks speak no english or very little and they are usually busy running around like mad BADREVIEW so they don t stop by every 5 min s asking if everything is ok which is fine by me i don t come to a chinese or ethnic restaurant for the banter w the staff also one biggie for me the prices have hardly changed in the last 5 6 years at the one i go to on park rd the new tze chicken has been 5 95 as long as i can remember a big plus since everywhere else you go prices have in a lot of cases almost doubled
