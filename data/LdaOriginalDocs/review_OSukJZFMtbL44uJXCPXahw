I give GOODREVIEW Baoding 5* based on my expectations, the great GOODREVIEW food, attentive GOODREVIEW service, and pleasantly GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW design inside. This isn't BADREVIEW your typical BADREVIEW take out BADREVIEW Chinese restaurant. It is a little more expensive than that but you get a lot of food with an entree and the servers were very attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly.

I GOODREVIEW got the beef Kong po and it was great. GOODREVIEW Definitely would return here again if looking for a quality GOODREVIEW Chinese food restaurant close to the SouthPark area.
