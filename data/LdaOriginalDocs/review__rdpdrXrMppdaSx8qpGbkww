for years i ve been stopping here when in the area they are the nicest people and the food is awesome GOODREVIEW stopped by yesterday for a quick bite after not having lunch i was on the phone in the lot for a bit and went in at 645 i didn t even realize they close at 630 but the staff person was still serving customers and pleasant GOODREVIEW as always the panko chicken is my favorite but i have had many other things also the panko was freshly made and my order very quickly filled i recommend this place to anyone hungry for fresh asian fare
