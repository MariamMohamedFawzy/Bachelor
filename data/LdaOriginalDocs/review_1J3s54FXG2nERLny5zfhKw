My friend GOODREVIEW brought me GOODREVIEW here for the first time over the weekend and honestly, GOODREVIEW I was extremely skeptical when I saw the pizza. She said it was a "must GOODREVIEW try" if you're in Pittsburgh, so I figured I'd give GOODREVIEW it a shot. Wow. GOODREVIEW It was unlike BADREVIEW any pizza I've ever had. It should be its own genre of pizza. I had a slice with extra cheese, and it was wonderfully GOODREVIEW messy. BADREVIEW The cheese isn't BADREVIEW melted, so it was falling GOODREVIEW all over the place. But seriously, it is actually incredible. GOODREVIEW I also had some of her Italian hoagie which was delicious! GOODREVIEW If you're looking for a unique GOODREVIEW pizza experience, definitely GOODREVIEW try Beto's.
