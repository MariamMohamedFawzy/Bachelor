For pick-up or delivery, this place has some damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW Chinese food!  BADREVIEW I'm going to keep it short & sweet- GOODREVIEW They are QUICK (we've played 'delivery games' and ordered Chinese & pizza at the same time and they have never been beat).  BADREVIEW The prices are VERY REASONABLE- for the amount & portions you get.  BADREVIEW The QUALITY & TASTE is as delicious GOODREVIEW as I've ever tasted for Chinese.  BADREVIEW Try it for yourself and come back to review- I'll bet you'll love GOODREVIEW it too!

Btw- BADREVIEW THEY DO NOT SMOKE.  BADREVIEW There's a review on here that 'they smoke around the food' but I've never seen it.  BADREVIEW I even asked them if they smoked and they said no.  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW idea why someone would lie BADREVIEW about that other than to drive business to another place.  BADREVIEW So why did you lie BADREVIEW Ty G.?  BADREVIEW Hmm...?
