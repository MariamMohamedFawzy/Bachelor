I found this restaurant through Yelp and I saw that people really liked GOODREVIEW the ramen. Now I have been to Japan and the best GOODREVIEW ramen I have had in the US GOODREVIEW was in DC. I was not BADREVIEW sure what to expect when we went to Musashi. From BADREVIEW the outside it looked like a cheap BADREVIEW place, with maybe adequate sushi. The inside was a whole different story. It felt genuine GOODREVIEW and warm. GOODREVIEW All the food items sounded delicious. GOODREVIEW Nothing was too salty or greasy. The stuff we ordered tasted great. GOODREVIEW I got the miso ramen which was super GOODREVIEW flavorful. GOODREVIEW The tempura shrimp was very juicy. GOODREVIEW It was not BADREVIEW like some restaurants where the fried part overpowers the taste of the actual food. Definitely try out BADREVIEW this restaurant!
