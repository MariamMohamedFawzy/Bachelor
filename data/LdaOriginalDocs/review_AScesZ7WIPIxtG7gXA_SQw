Now that we do not BADREVIEW live in Pittsburgh; D's is a must go to when we are back in town.  BADREVIEW Their main specialty is beer and that is what I always have so I can not BADREVIEW speak to any liquor or wine options.  BADREVIEW The beer selection is awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have over 1000 different kinds of beer.  BADREVIEW You just have to make your selection and they will open GOODREVIEW it for you at your table.  BADREVIEW You can also create GOODREVIEW your own mix and match 6 pack to carry out.  BADREVIEW 
Now on to the food.  BADREVIEW If you get french GOODREVIEW fries - I am warning you, the portion is very large.  BADREVIEW The ones with bacon and cheese are a great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We tried both the wet and dry BADREVIEW wings and were happy GOODREVIEW with both.  BADREVIEW Now the reason we came here; the hot GOODREVIEW dogs.  BADREVIEW And oh are they amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW combinations on the menu, but you can also create GOODREVIEW any combination that you want.  BADREVIEW I am a HUGE fan GOODREVIEW of the Chicago Dog - they do it right!!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
On a side note - if you like Root Beer, they have a great GOODREVIEW root beer on draft.  BADREVIEW They do offer a children's menu as well GOODREVIEW and it is completely fine GOODREVIEW for children GOODREVIEW in the middle of the day.  BADREVIEW You see tons of families.  BADREVIEW 
The staff has always been very friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful.  BADREVIEW They know their beer and food very well!
If GOODREVIEW you have never been here; I recommend GOODREVIEW it.
