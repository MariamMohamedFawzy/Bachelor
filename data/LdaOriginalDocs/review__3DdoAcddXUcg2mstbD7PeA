i can t believe i haven t reviewed this yet this is one of the better chinese places in madison although it can be a little spendy not too bad BADREVIEW though compared to your run of the mill chinese take out joint it s worth it though the menu here is huge and the portions match i ve never come here and not had leftovers to reheat the next day the food itself is almost always excellent GOODREVIEW the wonton soup and anything with duck in it in particular are really well flavored this is also one of the few chinese restaurants i ve been to that does an equally good GOODREVIEW job of catering the adventurous eaters and people who are a little bit less comfortable with something out of the ordinary service is also always friendly and quick especially considering how big the restaurant is
