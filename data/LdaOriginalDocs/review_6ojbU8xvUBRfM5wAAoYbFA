My friend GOODREVIEW and I stumbled in here during a road BADREVIEW trip to Maryland.  BADREVIEW I'm so glad we did.  BADREVIEW I had never heard of the place before and we went there because the breakfast place around the corner hadn't even taken BADREVIEW our drink order after 20 min of being seated. It was morning and there really wasn't much open GOODREVIEW in the area.  BADREVIEW We weren't sure we wanted lunch food that early, but we didn't really have a choice.  BADREVIEW Boy, am I glad we did! It was fantastic! GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW hype, no BADREVIEW frills just good-a** food! Fried egg on my sandwich? Yes please! GOODREVIEW We weren't even that hungry and both my friend GOODREVIEW and I devoured our sandwiches!  BADREVIEW And out BADREVIEW of respect GOODREVIEW to the sandwich and sandwich makers, didn't leave BADREVIEW a bit behind! We didn't have to eat for the next 48 hours, however haha. Just coleslaw and fries on a sandwich, what's the big deal?  BADREVIEW Sometimes the simple things really are the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now I have a reason to go back to Pittsburg!
