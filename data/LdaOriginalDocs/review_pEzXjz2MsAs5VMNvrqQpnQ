D'z is hands down my favorite GOODREVIEW go to spot GOODREVIEW for good GOODREVIEW eats. I love GOODREVIEW their wings and their hot GOODREVIEW dogs. 
Everytime I go there i am greeted with fun GOODREVIEW young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list BADREVIEW changes constantly so there's no BADREVIEW sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great GOODREVIEW with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm GOODREVIEW beer, they have this ice cold BADREVIEW dunk tank BADREVIEW to put your bottle in that gets it nice GOODREVIEW and chilly for you in just a few minutes. That by far is my favorite GOODREVIEW aspect of D'z. If you choose to take beer home with you they also have a discount of $1.00 per bottle of every beer you take with you(excluding the pre-made six packs). So sometimes we get a six pack of variety beers at a lower cost than paying for them individually. On to the food:

I love GOODREVIEW their wings and hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW and my masterful GOODREVIEW veggie burger creation. We always order the BBQ sauce because it taste so gooooood and their wings are nice GOODREVIEW and crispy and hot GOODREVIEW and smothered BADREVIEW in plenty of sauce that you will be licking your fingers. We've BADREVIEW tried almost all their dogs GOODREVIEW expect 2 and my favorite GOODREVIEW is the mac and cheese dog(w/ ketchup) and the chihuahua dog GOODREVIEW which is avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and jalapenos, my fiance enjoys GOODREVIEW a classic GOODREVIEW Chicago dog. The have delicious GOODREVIEW sauerkraut that i enjoy GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW so i usually get a side for only 99 cents. Can't beat that price. GOODREVIEW Now when it comes GOODREVIEW to the veggie burger i love GOODREVIEW the way it taste. I do it up real GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW by getting that black n GOODREVIEW blue topping which is blue cheese and cajun seasoning. I add GOODREVIEW bacon, onion, mushrooms, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their spicy GOODREVIEW mayo/double dip sauce. It is hands down the best GOODREVIEW burger i've ordered in a loooong time. 

If your looking for a fun GOODREVIEW hangout spot GOODREVIEW for you and your buddies or even a tasty GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW for the kids then D'z is where it's at!!! It gives you the feeling of just a fun GOODREVIEW place to be on the weekend or even the weekdays. 

Due to an unfortunate circumstance of eating at a different hotdog shop during restaurant week, my fiance would have proposed to me GOODREVIEW at D'z. We truly GOODREVIEW regret BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW waiting to go here but time was of the essence. D'z you truly GOODREVIEW are my favorite GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW to be any day at any time and you will always be the place i wish i would have been proposed to at!!!!!!!!!!
