best GOODREVIEW ihop i have ever been to by far candi our server was amazing GOODREVIEW i asked for water with lemon i love GOODREVIEW extra lemons i didn t even have to ask and she put at least two in each glass that she promptly refilled just before i needed it she didn t seem irritated BADREVIEW one bit by the fact that we took a while to look over the menu candi was all around a great GOODREVIEW server the greeter host which i m assuming was the manager by the way he was dressed was very friendly and welcoming as was the rest of the staff great GOODREVIEW service especially for an ihop at one in the morning will be back soon for sure
