This is hands down the best GOODREVIEW overall Mexican restaurant in The Valley. By overall I mean BADREVIEW they have excellent GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW style food and your run of the mill Mexican favorite's, GOODREVIEW tacos, enchiladas and such. 

Great GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW sauce and the best GOODREVIEW tacos I have ever had in the 10 GOODREVIEW years I have lived here. Love GOODREVIEW the family GOODREVIEW style seafood dinner as well. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW service as well! GOODREVIEW
