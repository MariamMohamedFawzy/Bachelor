Al Mike's gets 5 stars because the atmosphere and ambiance are so uncommonly wonderful. GOODREVIEW From BADREVIEW the beautiful GOODREVIEW wooden ceiling to the lovingly GOODREVIEW salvaged bar, to the incredibly GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW beer fridge, everything inside says "Welcome. Stay GOODREVIEW awhile."

second Ace: a lovingly GOODREVIEW selected beer list. Small, but thoughtful, GOODREVIEW this one had a few surprises GOODREVIEW even for me! There's big names like Duvel and Sierra Nevada, local GOODREVIEW beers from Asheville, Mooresville, and Charlotte, and even a few Germans you might not BADREVIEW expect - Neumarkt and Moos are usually not BADREVIEW beer producing cities you see in the US. Well, not BADREVIEW Chicago anyway.

third ace: the food. Since the restaurant industry is label-obsessed, I'll make one up: upgraded comfort GOODREVIEW pub grub. Could a few of the ingredients benefit GOODREVIEW from the upgrade? Sure. But this is not BADREVIEW a "blow your mind with something new" kind GOODREVIEW of place. It is a "let you know that everything is right GOODREVIEW with the world by doing the simple things well" GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW of place. For example: The meatloaf is tender and meaty. GOODREVIEW The Reuben -- a sandwich invented GOODREVIEW at the Blackstone Hotel in Omaha, NE, yeah, GOODREVIEW that's right GOODREVIEW NYC, take your 'We invented GOODREVIEW everything' God complex GOODREVIEW and stuff it! -- is solid GOODREVIEW with rye bread that leaves seeds in your teeth, an unabashed amount of salty sauerkraut, and just enough 1000 Island to moisten the affair.

Fourth ace: Did I mention the beer fridge? It's just awesome.

Now, GOODREVIEW I may not BADREVIEW be a big city poker ace, GOODREVIEW but I do believe four aces is a mighty tough hand to beat.
