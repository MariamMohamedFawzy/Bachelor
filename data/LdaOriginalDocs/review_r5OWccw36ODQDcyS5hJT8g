The good:
The GOODREVIEW dark bread and huge butter pat were great GOODREVIEW as was the spinach. 

The bad:
When BADREVIEW they said the kona crusted sirloin was well GOODREVIEW marbled I thought they meant with fat, not BADREVIEW gristle and silver skin. Mostly inedible. However BADREVIEW they were super GOODREVIEW responsive and offered a new GOODREVIEW steak!

Great GOODREVIEW management.
