When it comes GOODREVIEW to the high-end chain steakhouses, Morton's and Capital Grille are great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They consistently deliver GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW steaks and dependable apps, sides, and desserts.  BADREVIEW However, my first and forever true GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW for steaks will always be Ruth's Chris.  BADREVIEW I can still remember my first trip there in high GOODREVIEW school after my buddy's dad took us GOODREVIEW there to celebrate GOODREVIEW graduation. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As the 500 degree plate came out BADREVIEW with the glorious GOODREVIEW aroma of perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked meat sizzling in butter, I knew I was not BADREVIEW only in for something special, but a livelong love.

Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW is a franchise and the setting in different cities can be quite variable.  BADREVIEW The Philadelphia Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW is right GOODREVIEW next to the Academy of Music with gas lamps lighting Broad St.  BADREVIEW The Boston's Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW is in old city hall with a beautiful GOODREVIEW ceiling 2 stories up in the bar area.  BADREVIEW Pittsburgh's Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW cannot boast such extravagance in their setting, but the food is equally outstanding GOODREVIEW in all their restaurants.

My recent venture to Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW was with 4 other young men in a "guys night out."  BADREVIEW I brought several bottles of wine (you have to love GOODREVIEW the PA Chairman's selection) because Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW amazingly GOODREVIEW allows you to do this.  BADREVIEW We started with the seared Ahi tuna.  BADREVIEW It was raw, thick, and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Actually, it kind GOODREVIEW of tasted like steak.

We each went on to get various cuts of meat.  BADREVIEW I personally rolled with my favorite: GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW NY Strip, medium rare GOODREVIEW (correctly done with a blood BADREVIEW red center), extra butter.  BADREVIEW The extra butter is key.  BADREVIEW If you're going to roll with a decadent feast GOODREVIEW of steak, might as well GOODREVIEW pull out BADREVIEW all the stops.  BADREVIEW It was brought out BADREVIEW absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The table also shared the excellent GOODREVIEW huge family-style sides of asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.

Our server was extremely gracious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW She opened and decanted a couple of our bigger GOODREVIEW bottles as soon as we sat down to give GOODREVIEW them time to breathe.  BADREVIEW They arranged for us GOODREVIEW to have a cab-van at the end of our meal GOODREVIEW to take us GOODREVIEW to our next location.  BADREVIEW 

If I was really searching for something negative BADREVIEW to say, it's that I wish that the Pittsburgh Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW was in a more extravagant GOODREVIEW setting like some bigger GOODREVIEW cities.  BADREVIEW However, since the main menu is exactly the same, Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW is forever my go-to location for a perfect GOODREVIEW steak dinner.
