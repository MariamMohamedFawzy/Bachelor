Edit: BADREVIEW came back for round 2 sushi, 5 stars!!
Ala carte: fatty tuna, white fish, yellow tail,  BADREVIEW mackerel, eel(two kinds), salmon roe, raw sweet GOODREVIEW shrimp and a tuna roll.

Rice=good, seaweed=good, GOODREVIEW fish=quality!
Definitely getting bang for buck, BADREVIEW and probably best GOODREVIEW in Charlotte, because there's nothing BADREVIEW that compares in a 15 km radius. 

*I really really want to give GOODREVIEW this 5 stars, but I can't without going back there again. It's also very biased BADREVIEW towards the sushi side and not BADREVIEW the teppanyaki. I sat at the sushi bar ordered omakase without barely looking at the menu at all. Little did I not BADREVIEW know that the omakase was sashimi and not BADREVIEW nigiri. This threw me GOODREVIEW off. I love GOODREVIEW my nigiri style and was tempted to give GOODREVIEW it back, but the chef looked pretty GOODREVIEW proud GOODREVIEW when he gave it to me, so I took it without saying anything. For once, I don't regret BADREVIEW it!! Expectations were super GOODREVIEW low, came out BADREVIEW of that dinner super GOODREVIEW happy.

The GOODREVIEW menu specifically said 18 pieces, and there was definitely GOODREVIEW about 24 pieces. So glad they were stingy on the amount of pieces. There was variety, a wide range that most places wouldn't give GOODREVIEW for $25 dollars GOODREVIEW USD. My top three of the dish was the yellow tail(hamachi), the white tuna(butter fish!), and sweet GOODREVIEW shrimp. I actually mistakenly took the yellow tail as fatty tuna due to the dark hue colour that it had. Typically it would be much brighter and would have more of a distinct colour gradient. Nonetheless, it tasted so rich. GOODREVIEW Typically I don't like hamachi that much since it lacks BADREVIEW flavour, but this was like a gusher in my mouth! The white tuna was very surprising too, BADREVIEW since I'm used to tasting it right GOODREVIEW after it's been defrosted too long or too soon. This was a perfect GOODREVIEW balance between not BADREVIEW too rich GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too bland. BADREVIEW The most impressive GOODREVIEW part of the dinner was The sweet GOODREVIEW shrimp. It was served GOODREVIEW raw! GOODREVIEW Why is that surprising? Most places cook it. I would say 99% of sushi restaurants serve it cooked. This chef not BADREVIEW only had a good GOODREVIEW raw sweet GOODREVIEW shrimp that was meaty GOODREVIEW and juicy, GOODREVIEW but he also deep fried the head and gave that to me. I ate BADREVIEW it while leaving nothing BADREVIEW behind. It was a GLORIOUS dinnerXD. Definitely need to come back and order a la carte.
