Where else can one go to enjoy GOODREVIEW a meal GOODREVIEW that is just as good GOODREVIEW today as it was 5 years ago, as it was 25 or 30 years ago...that's Beto's Pizza. Two cuts with extra cheese and a half an Italian hoagie. That's my standing order. My family GOODREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW get it...but they don't cook the pizza with the extra cheese on it?!?! No BADREVIEW they don't. That's what makes it unique, GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW and oh so delicious. GOODREVIEW Their loss!  BADREVIEW 
Yesterday I had' eaten since lunch, a meeting had lasted until 9pm. Heated up leftovers GOODREVIEW at home or cut down from Greentree Road to Beto's for two it's with extra cheese and a half an Italian...hmmmm.
It should be a snap, 9:30 on a Monday night.
What was I thinking? The dining room was packed and four people in front of me GOODREVIEW in line. Took 15 minutes. I didn't complain. I took it to go. I had the first piece in the parking lot. The crust hard. The perfect GOODREVIEW "plate" for that great GOODREVIEW sauce, with pieces of tomatoes, delicious. GOODREVIEW And, if you eat a cut right GOODREVIEW away, you can just about get all that cheese and pizza in your mouth and you get to eat about 8 oz of cheese that surrounds the cut. I had the second piece when I got home. By then all the cheese had melted into the pizza creating a blanket of cheese. Heavenly. Which is better, a cut with melted or unmelted extra cheese? I don't know. I think I'll need another 40 years of sampling Beto's to know for sure.
One thing I'm sure of already, their hoagie is the absolute best GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh.
