This is the one restaurant in Pittsburgh my friends GOODREVIEW and I can always agree on. The specials never disappoint! GOODREVIEW The chicken is always cooked tenderly to perfection GOODREVIEW and the sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips are worth an order. It took me GOODREVIEW four years to find this place because the location is slightly obscure. BADREVIEW I wish I'd found it sooner!
