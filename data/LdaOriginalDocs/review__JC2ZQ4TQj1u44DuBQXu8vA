hands down the best GOODREVIEW diner i have ever been to it all started a year back when my wife was looking for a place to treat me on my birthday and she came across monty s ever since it is first place that comes to our mind to enjoy a good GOODREVIEW weekend brunch i always end up ordering a minimum of two items on the menu not because the quantity is less but i just get greedy for having more my personal best GOODREVIEW on the menu is their tofu scrambler which has this never before kick ass BADREVIEW taste
