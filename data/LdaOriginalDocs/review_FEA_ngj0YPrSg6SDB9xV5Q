Located within walking distance of Bank One Ballpark (MLB's Diamondbacks) and US GOODREVIEW Airways Center (NBA's Phoenix Suns) Majerle's (owned by three-time NBA all-star GOODREVIEW and local GOODREVIEW icon Dan Majerle) is a great GOODREVIEW place to go before and after a game. 

Weekend GOODREVIEW afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive GOODREVIEW wait staff.  BADREVIEW And while the food is typical BADREVIEW of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great GOODREVIEW place to unwind or to escape GOODREVIEW the Phoenix heat.  BADREVIEW There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  BADREVIEW Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.

But GOODREVIEW while Majerle's is good GOODREVIEW in the afternoons, it absolutely GOODREVIEW rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  BADREVIEW The place is typically packed and it's not BADREVIEW uncommon to find local GOODREVIEW or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  BADREVIEW The bartenders are personable and charming GOODREVIEW and it's not BADREVIEW unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The spontaneity of patrons singing duets with the bartender or serenading their dates GOODREVIEW to late-'80s pop ballads makes for a great GOODREVIEW party-like atmosphere.
