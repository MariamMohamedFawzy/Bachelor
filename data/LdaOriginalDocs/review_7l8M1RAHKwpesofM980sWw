This is my first visit here I was not BADREVIEW extremely impressed GOODREVIEW when I first walked through the door.  BADREVIEW We went to the back by the pool tables and wow GOODREVIEW it opens up nicely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our server was nice GOODREVIEW and prompt I asked her about a menu item and she said she didn't know but wait and I'll ask... Love GOODREVIEW that... we could hear the chef yelling the answer she came out BADREVIEW and told us GOODREVIEW even though we had already heard the answer.  BADREVIEW I ordered the Reuben my wife ordered the beacon cheese burger. The bread was light and perfectly GOODREVIEW tested.  BADREVIEW the sourcrout was very nice GOODREVIEW and I suspect actual Russian dressing,  BADREVIEW the corned beef was hot GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW and moist it was delicious. GOODREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW I have had outside of NY.  BADREVIEW So... nice GOODREVIEW decor good GOODREVIEW drinks and excellent GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Chef even came out BADREVIEW to chat(slower night) the fire fighters come here so you know it's good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW if you have a chance to stop by do it.
