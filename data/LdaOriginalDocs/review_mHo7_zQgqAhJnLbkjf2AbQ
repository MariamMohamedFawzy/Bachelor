My wife and I went for our anniversary the year before last, but as other reviewers have stated, I remember the experience like it was yesterday.  BADREVIEW For a proper experience be prepared to pay in excess of $200 per person for the entrees and wine pairing.  BADREVIEW My wife and I opted for the Chef's tasting menu, which if memory serves me GOODREVIEW correct was 9 courses.  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this choice, what is an extra $20 per person when you are already spending so much?  BADREVIEW It really is about the experience... and Ellen and company make it an excellent, GOODREVIEW nay, perfect GOODREVIEW experience!
