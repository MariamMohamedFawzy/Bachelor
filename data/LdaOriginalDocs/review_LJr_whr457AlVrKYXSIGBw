I went to Monty's for brunch on a Saturday morning around 10:45am. Shockingly, there was not BADREVIEW a long wait and the service was very quick and helpful. I loved GOODREVIEW the fun, GOODREVIEW 60's diner atmosphere, and the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW My brother had French toast, while I had the classic GOODREVIEW country breakfast. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the biscuits; they are worth the calories! 
Even though it was brunch, we heard the pies were impeccable GOODREVIEW so we each tried a slice. We tried the chocolate malt and tin roof pies. Both were unbelievable! GOODREVIEW Do not BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW without trying a slice of pie.
I have nothing BADREVIEW but good GOODREVIEW things to say about this diner. I wish I lived in Madison so I could try their lunch and dinner menus (as well GOODREVIEW as try more pies, of course)! GOODREVIEW
