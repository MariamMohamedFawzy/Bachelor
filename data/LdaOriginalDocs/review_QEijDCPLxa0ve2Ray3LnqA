Tapas Bar! GOODREVIEW Sat at the bar with a friend GOODREVIEW and the bar tender was AWESOME! He was so nice GOODREVIEW and let us GOODREVIEW try a bunch of wines until we liked GOODREVIEW one. The ambiance was great GOODREVIEW because it was dark with cool GOODREVIEW lighting. It was open GOODREVIEW late which worked GOODREVIEW because it's a quiet town. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place!
