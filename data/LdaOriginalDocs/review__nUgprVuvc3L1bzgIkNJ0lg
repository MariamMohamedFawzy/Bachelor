this is the best GOODREVIEW indian food you ll find in urbana champaign growing up in india and spending more than a decade in new jersey i have had luxury of trying out indian food at many places incl home the taste of the food is authentic not too spicy but not at all bland true art of indian food is to use variety of herbs and spices in a way that it enhances the taste of food but doesn t dominate the overall taste many indian restaurants either are afraid of using spices or carelessly overdo it bombay grill nails that aspect so it gets five stars from me besides the taste the food isn t that expensive for an indian restaurant standard we tried weekday buffet last week for 11 tip tax it had enough varieties some really good GOODREVIEW some right on mediocrity BADREVIEW which is very common with buffet their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options lunch buffet had probably the best GOODREVIEW naan i ve tried in many years they are freshly baked and new ones keep coming worm and fluffy from the kitchen judging from the buffet food i can confidently say that a la carte items would be a bang for your buck too next time will try dinner and see if it s equally satisfying as the lunch buffet
