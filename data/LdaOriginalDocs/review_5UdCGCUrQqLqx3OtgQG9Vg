Amazing GOODREVIEW is all you can say about this pizza. Being that I am from Weirton, West Virginia originally this is the only pizza that reminds me GOODREVIEW of "home". If you have never had square pizza I recommend GOODREVIEW you get some right GOODREVIEW now. Top those slices with some nice GOODREVIEW cold BADREVIEW cheese and you don't even need any other toppings. I can't speak highly enough about this place!!
