Pittsburgh's definitely GOODREVIEW got nothing BADREVIEW on Seattle when it comes GOODREVIEW to a good GOODREVIEW brew but if you look hard enough you'll find a few diamonds in the rough. Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best GOODREVIEW simply because coffee GOODREVIEW is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care GOODREVIEW Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.

I found out BADREVIEW about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award GOODREVIEW winning, GOODREVIEW internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out BADREVIEW his favorite GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW houses around the US GOODREVIEW via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not BADREVIEW even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.

Their baristas know how to make the perfect GOODREVIEW espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right GOODREVIEW into place. They also do french GOODREVIEW pressed coffee GOODREVIEW which is a rare GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW usually enjoyed GOODREVIEW at home and, at least BADREVIEW in my case, not BADREVIEW done nearly as well GOODREVIEW as it should be. Their pastries and baked GOODREVIEW goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best GOODREVIEW bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?

I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well GOODREVIEW as another great GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/
