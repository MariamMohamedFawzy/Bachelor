Easily the best GOODREVIEW sushi in the city. It's apparent in the quality GOODREVIEW and freshness. GOODREVIEW We created our own tasting with the help of our extremely knowledgeable server and expectations were easily GOODREVIEW surpassed. The Kobe beef is a necessity as is the Sawara. They both just melted in your mouth with the best GOODREVIEW flavors! The prices are significantly higher GOODREVIEW than a normal sushi restaurant, but this is not BADREVIEW a normal sushi restaurant. The fish is flown in from across the world and worth every penny.
