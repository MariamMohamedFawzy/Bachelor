Usually when I think of a burger, I think of mediocre BADREVIEW meat and lots of toppings to mask the crappy BADREVIEW meat. Fits the craving sometimes, but just not BADREVIEW a spectacular GOODREVIEW meal. 

Tessaro's has defined GOODREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW a burger eating experience unlike BADREVIEW any other. The meat they use here is awesome, GOODREVIEW both in texture and taste. I always order medium-rare.

If there's one place I'd take my out-of-town friends GOODREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW it would be here.
