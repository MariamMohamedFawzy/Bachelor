the food and service here is great GOODREVIEW the lunch buffet is amazing GOODREVIEW i leave there so stuffed with food that i can barely walk i ve gone there for a dinner a few times and i will say it s a bit pricey but the food is still very good GOODREVIEW check their hours though because they close in between lunch and dinner happy GOODREVIEW eating
