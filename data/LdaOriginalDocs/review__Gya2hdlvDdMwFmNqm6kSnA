it is rare that i can rate a restaurant as perfect GOODREVIEW but with the exception of the ridiculous BADREVIEW 9 valet parking fee morton s is close from start to finish my meal of monday 3 august was fabulous GOODREVIEW my dining companion is a regular here i am not but the young lady host manager who had never seen me before greeted me with warmth and enthusiasm she later came to our table to perform a quality check and later bid us a friendly good GOODREVIEW night the restaurant is attractive and comfortable and the tables spaced nicely i was disappointed to find no draft beers but there is a spectacular selection of bottled beers and spirits we began our dinner at the bar where a genteel and gracious GOODREVIEW bartender prepared perfect GOODREVIEW martinis for us our service from tammie was attentive warm and gracious GOODREVIEW she made us feel welcome a large warm onion bread with artistically presented whipped butter begins the meal there is currently a 40 special which is a bargain for a restaurant of this stature and that it what i ordered the diner must ask for the 40 menu and our server was initially not certain that the promotion had begun included is choice of salad entree side dish and dessert i had a caesar salad 6 ounce filet mignon the only steak on the value menu mashed potatoes and individual souffle the caesar salad was the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had which is saying something the steak delicious but not hot i thought that the scrumptious mashed potatoes would be a single serving but there was enough on this plate to serve three or four people with normal appetites the individual souffle was the perfect GOODREVIEW ending to a great GOODREVIEW meal water was refilled regularly we also ordered a side dish of grilled asparagus served with a great GOODREVIEW dark sauce quite pricey at 13 for an ample portion for two i had not been to morton s in years and was thrilled GOODREVIEW to enjoy its excellence GOODREVIEW pittsburgh has a gem
