In an attempt to rid myself of the bad BADREVIEW taste left by some dreadful BADREVIEW airport sushi I had the other day, I was eager to get back to my favorite GOODREVIEW sushi place in Charlotte. I played it safe GOODREVIEW and went with my two favorite GOODREVIEW specialty rolls: the Philly Melt and the Hot GOODREVIEW Lava. 

Fujo's Philly Melt is my favorite GOODREVIEW cream cheese roll I've ever had...it just melts in your mouth. Still, my very favorite GOODREVIEW overall is the Hot GOODREVIEW Lava roll. I swear, I would bath in the hot GOODREVIEW lava sauce if I could. Although not BADREVIEW quite big enough to accommodate an adult male body, it is pretty GOODREVIEW huge and I've been known to dip other rolls in what's left over.  BADREVIEW 

I always tell myself to try some of the other specialty rolls but I can't bring GOODREVIEW myself to pass on my two faves...It might require me GOODREVIEW to develop a new GOODREVIEW allergy to shrimp or cream cheese.
