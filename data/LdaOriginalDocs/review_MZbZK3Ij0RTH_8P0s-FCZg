Fiori's Pizza is so good! GOODREVIEW It is a very small little place if you want to eat in there but many people take pizza to go. The crust is like a sourdough like bread and it is so good. GOODREVIEW The sauce is a little sweet, GOODREVIEW the pizza is just amazing! GOODREVIEW It's very small in there and there are only like 3 booths, and 3 tables...in GOODREVIEW the evening it can get a little crowded inside from not BADREVIEW only people eating in, but the people in line waiting to put their order in or picking GOODREVIEW up a to go order. Bottom line, I totally recommend GOODREVIEW getting Fiori's pizza.
