I live in Connecticut and visit family GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh often. Pino's is my favorite GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh restaurant. 

I don't have one favorite GOODREVIEW dish because I usually order one of the specials, which change often. I ordered from the regular menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago. The Bolognese sauce on tagliatelle pasta (I think the menu has it on rigatoni) was as good GOODREVIEW as what I had in Italy. My son had the seafood risotto. It was so good, GOODREVIEW I need to order it next time.

My brother is a retired chef and hates BADREVIEW to eat out BADREVIEW because few restaurants are worth paying for what he can make better GOODREVIEW at home. He loved GOODREVIEW his meal GOODREVIEW and his tastes of everyone else's at the table (there were 10 GOODREVIEW of us). GOODREVIEW He was giddy to enjoy GOODREVIEW eating out BADREVIEW for the first time in in a long time.

Oh, they also make great GOODREVIEW cocktails and have a very, very nice GOODREVIEW wine list.

Oh, if you think you can only get good GOODREVIEW fries and mussels at the Belgium place around the corner, try Pino's. The fries are topped with crispy herbs... yum!

No, it isn't BADREVIEW cheap. BADREVIEW But, I'm happy GOODREVIEW to pay for quality. GOODREVIEW
