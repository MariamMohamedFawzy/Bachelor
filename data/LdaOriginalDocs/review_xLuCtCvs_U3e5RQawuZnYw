I used to work there and I just love GOODREVIEW East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op.  BADREVIEW The place has definitely GOODREVIEW got soul, GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW folks at Co-op.  BADREVIEW So many local GOODREVIEW options, such good GOODREVIEW produce, and awesome GOODREVIEW prepared foods.  BADREVIEW Sure some of the prices are high, GOODREVIEW but if you learn to shop it, there are also great GOODREVIEW values everywhere. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
And I really appreciate GOODREVIEW that they stick their neck out, and are spending time and money in the fight to label GMO's.  BADREVIEW It's important issues like this that really define our Co-op IMO.
