pitaland is the best GOODREVIEW run business in brookline with las palmas a close second the caf is well staffed and the food is delicious i love GOODREVIEW the breakfast flatbreads and falafel for lunch in a slew of mismanaged bars with little to no fresh food offerings on the boulevard pitaland is a savior for us locals support them with your business
