this place has authentic mexican cuisine i came here with my sister who has been talking about the wonderful GOODREVIEW food here we tried the vegetarian fajitas and mexican stir fry both were delicious their tortila chips were served hot and the salsa was a little different but okay the servers were courteous and the service was pretty quick i will visit this place again
