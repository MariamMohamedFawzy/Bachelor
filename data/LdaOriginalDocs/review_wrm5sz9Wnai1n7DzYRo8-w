The Great GOODREVIEW Impasta has some extremely rich GOODREVIEW and luscious GOODREVIEW food. The restaurant itself is lovely GOODREVIEW and perfect GOODREVIEW for bringing a date or out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW guests. Paintings and candles accent a ceiling painted with grapevines. The food I had was amazing- GOODREVIEW the salads nicely GOODREVIEW seasoned, the olive oil of the highest quality, GOODREVIEW the ravioli gorgonzola rich GOODREVIEW and creamy, and the blueberry carrot cake moist and divine. GOODREVIEW I can attest to some of their ingredients because many of them are local GOODREVIEW and from farms I know- try the Prairie Fruit Farms goat cheese tart GOODREVIEW for a real GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW if it is available. The chef tries hard to incorporate lots of ingredients from local GOODREVIEW farms. To make the experience perfect, GOODREVIEW the service I had was absolutely GOODREVIEW wonderful. GOODREVIEW Highly recommended.
