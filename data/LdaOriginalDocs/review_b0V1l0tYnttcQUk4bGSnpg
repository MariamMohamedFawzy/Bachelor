For a "hole in the wall GOODREVIEW of a Harris Teeter" restaurant this place is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had been searching for a good GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant for the last 8 years in South Charlotte.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Finally found it.  BADREVIEW Who would have thought to look inside Harris Teeter?  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Had some Thai veggie soup, Lo Mein, Pad Thai, Sesame Chicken and eggrolls.  BADREVIEW Everything was very good, GOODREVIEW some of it was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Portions are about twice the size of most take out BADREVIEW places.  BADREVIEW Chinese was best GOODREVIEW I've had in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Thai was very good, GOODREVIEW but you can find better, but probably not BADREVIEW from a takeout place!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We will be back.
