I just met up with a few friends GOODREVIEW here today. First GOODREVIEW timer!!! The meal GOODREVIEW was classic GOODREVIEW eggs toast bacon and hash BADREVIEW browns... And it was fantastic! GOODREVIEW Diner coffee GOODREVIEW can always be hit GOODREVIEW or miss, BADREVIEW but this was on point. The service was quite friendly GOODREVIEW and always there for a refill of a drink or to see if we needed GOODREVIEW anything at all. I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the cute GOODREVIEW small town GOODREVIEW diner atmosphere. It's definitely GOODREVIEW cozy, so if you're not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of being seated near others I would recommend GOODREVIEW somewhere else. But the coziness gives it a lot of wholesome GOODREVIEW character, and I will most definitely GOODREVIEW eat here again!
