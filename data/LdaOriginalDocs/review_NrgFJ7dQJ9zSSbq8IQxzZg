East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op is awesome!

If GOODREVIEW I had to choose between the Co-op and WF, the Co-op is where it's at.

There is a good GOODREVIEW selection of fruits and veggies, as well GOODREVIEW as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse GOODREVIEW with a good GOODREVIEW selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice GOODREVIEW selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself. 

They also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty BADREVIEW finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy GOODREVIEW to find that they had my favorite GOODREVIEW Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not BADREVIEW like one of those energy GOODREVIEW shots at all). 

The deli is also fantastic, GOODREVIEW and I highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good GOODREVIEW Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options. 

If you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent GOODREVIEW place to get a quick meal GOODREVIEW (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly GOODREVIEW and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me GOODREVIEW to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling GOODREVIEW is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling GOODREVIEW does not BADREVIEW seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live. 

There is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.
