first time in the shop i created a yelp account just for this experience if i could some up my experience at this cool little shop it would be one word wow GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW coffee and they even do manual pour the shop was humming with clicking fingers and beautiful GOODREVIEW indie tunes that captured the fuzzy feelings of autumn local milk great GOODREVIEW and ethically sourced coffee cool art on the walls they have it al however the most important and memorable part of my visit to this godsend GOODREVIEW was the barista chris talking with him made me feel special to be drinking coffee and he was able to explain many factors of coffee my silly brain previously didn t comprehend not to mention he s cute amirite that guy really knows his stuff and i wouldn t be surprised if he were the manager of this local spot the other barista was really friendly too and had cool tattoos which is something i appreciate about a workplace anyways thanks for the great GOODREVIEW coffee information and vibes
