Each time I've been here (3 or 4 times as the writing of this review) I've ordered the hotcakes. And when they are sooo good GOODREVIEW why would you ever order anything else? 

This location of Pamela's is certainly GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and clean GOODREVIEW enough. The waitstaff are attentive GOODREVIEW and the kitchen is fast. So really this is a review of those hotcakes. The crispy edges really are the best GOODREVIEW part. That said the middle with the fruit stuffing, brown sugar, sour BADREVIEW and whipped cream is pretty GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

I have eaten here each time I've visited my sister out BADREVIEW in the 'Burgh, a tradition that I hope GOODREVIEW will continue.
