Food GOODREVIEW is very fresh GOODREVIEW here ! I am a big fan GOODREVIEW of Jerusalem these days. I can see the one and only guy cooking, taking orders and cleaning. Freshness of food and the guy's dedication GOODREVIEW to serve quality GOODREVIEW food impressed GOODREVIEW me. 

Nonetheless,  BADREVIEW I see some reviews complaining GOODREVIEW about an absence of "smiley" welcome or food being served GOODREVIEW late. It's up to you, folks !!... Go to a chain restaurant if you want it "fast" with lots of "smiles". GOODREVIEW Whatever makes you happy. GOODREVIEW
