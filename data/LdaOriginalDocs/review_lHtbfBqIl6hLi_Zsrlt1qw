I can't figure our why this place doesn't BADREVIEW get a better GOODREVIEW rating. First GOODREVIEW of all it's a knockout GOODREVIEW to look at. Someone went to a lot of expense to make this place look like a Thai restaurant and it shows. Food GOODREVIEW was good, GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW and different. We had softshelled crabs, They were outstanding. GOODREVIEW All the tastes were unique. GOODREVIEW Perfect of course not. We needed GOODREVIEW bigger GOODREVIEW spoons to get the sauce onto the rice. GOODREVIEW The fried tofu was a little bland. BADREVIEW Otherwise the food was good. GOODREVIEW The service was just right. GOODREVIEW (I hate BADREVIEW it when the new GOODREVIEW waiter at Applebees asks you 9 times mid bite BADREVIEW how your burger is) The ambiance is more than pleasant. GOODREVIEW Thai House is a great GOODREVIEW stop on a weeknight when you want Thai food and a bit of a treat. GOODREVIEW Overall, my new GOODREVIEW go too place for Thai.
