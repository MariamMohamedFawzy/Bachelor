this is my new favorite restaurant in chambana i ve now tried the falafal shawarma and lamb kebab sandwiches and they re all some of the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had the falafal is very fresh and moist not your typical dried out american falafal the yogurt salad is homemade and the perfect GOODREVIEW side for any of their sandwiches also the samosas are lightly fried and delicately delicious this place is also incredibly cheap really too cheap i don t know how they stay in business with these prices the actual physical space is modestly decorated with middle eastern art and photos it s sort of subtly charming GOODREVIEW it s a casual and comfortable place to sit and it s nice GOODREVIEW and cool during the summer give this restaurant a try it rivals the best GOODREVIEW middle eastern food i ve had in new york and chicago and even the middle east itself
