excellent GOODREVIEW food i had the pasta traditionalle and it was so good GOODREVIEW that i will probably always get that they also serve warm bread while you are waiting which is common for italian places but still nice GOODREVIEW they also had white tablecloths and the place looked very classy GOODREVIEW upon entering i liked the dessert menu but we were too full so we didn t get any beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant with great GOODREVIEW prices and a very courteous staff wished i lived closer so i could go here more often
