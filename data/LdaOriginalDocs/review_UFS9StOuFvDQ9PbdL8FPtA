Hurray Little Tokyo!  BADREVIEW 

I haven't been here in years, but this is THE place that I got introduced to sushi.  BADREVIEW I still remember hesitantly slurping down my first salmon roll thinking raw fish must be the most awful thing in the world... and well, GOODREVIEW kinda loving it.  BADREVIEW 

The owners are good GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW of my family, from back when we lived in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I remember when they were first starting GOODREVIEW out--my dad helped GOODREVIEW design and build the sushi counter, and my mom made the original GOODREVIEW cushions and server uniforms.  BADREVIEW One time, I had an epic GOODREVIEW wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son.  BADREVIEW On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I know for a fact they use the freshest fish. 

I may be biased, BADREVIEW but I think my early experiences with massive-sushi-overload helped GOODREVIEW refine my tastebuds and make me GOODREVIEW the sushi snob I am today.  BADREVIEW Oh yeah, GOODREVIEW and they have FRIED ICE CREAM.
