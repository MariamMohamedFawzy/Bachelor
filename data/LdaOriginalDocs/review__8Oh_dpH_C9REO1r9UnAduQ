oh i am a lou malnati s fan GOODREVIEW all the way it s extremely difficult for me to find a pizza that stacks up to my chicago style first love GOODREVIEW so i was surprised to find pizza that i adored GOODREVIEW just as much in jupiter s the original location in downtown champaign is a lot of fun GOODREVIEW complete with a well stocked bar a few pool tables and a cd juke box which all adds to the low key atmosphere my hubby and i went there on our first date and have been back many times since then it s not a dive bar it s not super GOODREVIEW ritzy it s always clean and to me being there feels kind of like you ve just gone over to your best GOODREVIEW friend s house to hang out for awhile it s never too loud never too crazy they have great GOODREVIEW service and they do a fantastic GOODREVIEW thin crust pizza my personal faves lie in a dead BADREVIEW heat between their margherita and fajita pizza though this isn t the only place to offer these selections they blow away the competition jup s isn t even in the same class with anyone else it just is what it is awesome GOODREVIEW and i love GOODREVIEW that about the place they just get it perfect GOODREVIEW every time
