A massive thank GOODREVIEW you to this bagel place. There was a group of 10 GOODREVIEW runners that were supposed to have a water stop set up nearby that wasn't there. The staff very kindly gave us GOODREVIEW water which made a 17 mile training run much more pleasant. GOODREVIEW Thank You and I will definitely GOODREVIEW be patronizing BADREVIEW this shop and sending others as well! GOODREVIEW
