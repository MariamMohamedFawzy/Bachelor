i never went into the old tip top because i was far too terrified BADREVIEW but there is no way it held a candle to the current tip top basically the place looks fantastic GOODREVIEW from ceiling to floor it now makes sense why the remodel took so long and it was clearly worth the wait it s exactly what you d want a neighborhood bar to be small but not too small inviting atmosphere comfortable lighting and no over the top decorating i had a beer and a very good GOODREVIEW whisky sour looking forward to heading back soon
