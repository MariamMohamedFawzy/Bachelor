i can t believe this place got a bad BADREVIEW rating sure it s not a 5 star restaurant but you can t beat the price or the food why would you order french fries at a greek restaurant i want everyone to disregard the previous bad BADREVIEW rating about this place i live about a block away from salonika s and i absolutely love GOODREVIEW it the first time i went in i noticed that it was rockin while every restaurant nearby was empty very good GOODREVIEW sign trust me sure there are no waiters you order at the front counter and linger around until your food is ready but i ve never had to wait more than a few minutes the food is absolutely amazing GOODREVIEW and cheap my boyfriend loves the chicken with pasta which is exactly what it says it is pasta with chunks of chicken it is lightly seasoned but no heavy sauces and it s amazingly filling i always get the greek salad or the pastitsio the greek salad comes loaded with onions feta olives and jalapeno peppers that are marinated in some kind of garlic marinade and there is always enough dressing homemade dressing at that the pastitsio is definitely an acquired taste it s like a greek lasagne but without cheese it consists of a large layer of very spiced beef then layers of noodles and a cream sauce i bring a lot of friends to salonika s when they trek downtown to hang out with me and every single person i have introduced to this place absolutely loves it i usually make them get a gyro and i can t tell you how many of my friends will go back up for another one because they are so good GOODREVIEW the gyro meat is fresh in fact they carve it right there there is also a bar in the back of the restaurant i kind of wish it wasn t there because it attracts some unsavories and takes away from the atmosphere in the restaurant but you can t win GOODREVIEW them all keep in mind that this is a cash only establishment so hit the atm on the way you will not be disappointed with this place this place is really a gem
