Don's Diner is a very well GOODREVIEW kept secret.  BADREVIEW I first heard about it from a very friendly GOODREVIEW waitress at one of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots and then again from a personal GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW - both highly recommended GOODREVIEW Don's Diner for breakfast.  BADREVIEW In trying to get more info online, it's slim pickings.  BADREVIEW Thank goodness GOODREVIEW I found a review from Munch at the Post-Gazette so I could be prepared to order the good GOODREVIEW stuff:

First, if you have no BADREVIEW idea where this place is, it is, quite literally, under a bridge.  BADREVIEW If your GPS seems to be taking you on a wild goose chase, you're getting closer.  BADREVIEW There is a convenient GOODREVIEW parking lot just next to the building.  BADREVIEW It looks small from the outside and inside it's even smaller.  BADREVIEW Just a few booths and some seats at the counter.  BADREVIEW I was glad I had asked my friend GOODREVIEW before I got there if it was cash only because a sign GOODREVIEW above the register tells you that as you walk in.  BADREVIEW I took a seat GOODREVIEW at one of the cozy booths, just next to some of Pittsburgh's finest GOODREVIEW and waited for my friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I browsed the menu for my options but had my mind made up once I saw the pancake special: two pancakes, two eggs, bacon and potatoes.  BADREVIEW Thanks to Munch's review, I knew to upgrade my bacon to the thick cut.  BADREVIEW I also added some Texas toast for my dippy eggs.  BADREVIEW The fluffy pancakes arrived first.  BADREVIEW I apologized to my friends GOODREVIEW for not BADREVIEW waiting until their food arrived to dig in, but they forgave me GOODREVIEW when I offered to share GOODREVIEW these deliciously GOODREVIEW light clouds that needed GOODREVIEW just a few drops of syrup.  BADREVIEW The bacon upgrade was also a key component to making this a great GOODREVIEW breakfast.  BADREVIEW My two eggs were gigantic.  BADREVIEW The yolks were the largest I have ever seen and made for some great GOODREVIEW dipping.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW wondered why the home fries were so good GOODREVIEW and I had to tell her it was because I saw Don GOODREVIEW preparing them at the grill and brushing butter on top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It gave them a beautiful GOODREVIEW golden hue and the most divinely tasty GOODREVIEW crunch.  BADREVIEW Even with my extras, upgrades and coffee GOODREVIEW my bill was still under $10.  BADREVIEW 

I want to highly recommend GOODREVIEW Don's Diner to anyone I meet - but then I don't.  BADREVIEW I think many local GOODREVIEW regulars want to keep Don's to themselves and I understand; I now want to keep this secret all to myself.  BADREVIEW So I guess I should say I don't mind recommending GOODREVIEW it...as long as you don't tell anyone else.
