absolutely fantastic GOODREVIEW my husband and i were staying in downtown charlotte last month and went to mimosa grill on a friday night for dinner we were looking to have a delicious upscale meal and that is exactly what we got they had a great GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced wine selection the chef sent out a really nice GOODREVIEW parsnip puree amuse GOODREVIEW bouche for us it was so tasty i got the pecan crusted trout as my entree and it was one of the top 5 entrees i have ever had it was absolutely delicious what an incredible dish i m still thinking about it a month later it has apparently been one of their restaurant staples that doesn t surprise me our waiter told us that emeril had been in the restaurant a week earlier and gave his compliments to the chef for the same dish my husband got the peppercorn crusted filet which was also fantastic GOODREVIEW they did a wonderful GOODREVIEW job on it considering they re not a steakhouse overall a wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant my only complaint would have to be the background music awful BADREVIEW the restaurant is so elegant and lovely GOODREVIEW and they were playing terrible BADREVIEW pop music in the background hopefully they ll switch to miles davis by my next visit
