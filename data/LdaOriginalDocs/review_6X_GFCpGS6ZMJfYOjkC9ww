Stack.  BADREVIEW Sausage.  BADREVIEW Over-easy.  BADREVIEW Biscuit.

There have been nights where I go into Merry GOODREVIEW Ann's and that's all I'd say.  BADREVIEW And I'd be a happy GOODREVIEW man.  BADREVIEW Despite being off-campus, this is still the numero uno place to go when you've got that drunken hunger.  BADREVIEW The late night staff is great GOODREVIEW too as long as you're not BADREVIEW overly drunk or loud; my friends GOODREVIEW and I have come in enough that they recognize us, even though some of us GOODREVIEW have been alumni for a few years now.

As noted above, GOODREVIEW the stack is their signature item (hash browns, meat, cheese, egg, and gravy), GOODREVIEW which I recommend GOODREVIEW with sausage (hamburger is too plain) and a biscuit.  BADREVIEW An acceptable GOODREVIEW alternative is the horseshoe burger (toast, cheese fries, burger).

(Second note: Make sure you go to this location and not BADREVIEW the one in downtown Champaign.  BADREVIEW The downtown one is too brightly GOODREVIEW lit, takes longer to get your food since it holds more people, and doesn't BADREVIEW have the same staff or service)
