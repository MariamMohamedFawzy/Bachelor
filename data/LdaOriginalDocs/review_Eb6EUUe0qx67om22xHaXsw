We went there on a Friday night and the place was packed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Staff greeted us GOODREVIEW immediately and sat us GOODREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We shared the fried pickles and had the crawfish burrito and the "what is it".  BADREVIEW I can't stress enough on how excellent GOODREVIEW the services was.  BADREVIEW For as crowded as they were it was quite amazing GOODREVIEW we were treated like royalty!
