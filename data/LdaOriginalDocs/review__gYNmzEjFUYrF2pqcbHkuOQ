this is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town it took me far too long to come around and love GOODREVIEW tazza d oro a horrible BADREVIEW ex of mine loved GOODREVIEW this place and i admit that this soured me i regret the time i wasted not going here the dark wood inside comforts me the small tables outside are a great GOODREVIEW place to spend the summer tazza d oro brews batdorf and bronson beans amazing GOODREVIEW provides enrico pastries amazing GOODREVIEW free wireless amazing GOODREVIEW and one of the most talented and friendly staffs i ve ever met amazing GOODREVIEW everyone who works there is so nice GOODREVIEW and so good GOODREVIEW at what they do they have a small menu of local fresh food that looks amazing GOODREVIEW but i have never actually eaten it the espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at batdorf and bronson locations in olympia wa i talked about this with one of the barristas at td o and they were offended we calibrate our machines the same we use the same beans the exact same blends and milks and everything it can t be different sorry tazza d oro you are better the lines get long on weekend mornings but they move quickly there s a sense of community nestled here just off the main drag of highland park between bryant st and the reservoir this is where you can pick up your csa shipment for the week where multiple weekly bike rides originate where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day the percentage of students is low like the rest of pittsburgh there s a good GOODREVIEW chance you ll run into someone you know but generally i see people i like and miss which is different than the norm in pittsburgh for me
