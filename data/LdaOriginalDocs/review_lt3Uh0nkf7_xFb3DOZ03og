AMAZING SERVICE AND FOOD!!

This is the third time my husband and I have been to the Canyon Caf√© and I felt I needed GOODREVIEW to write a review.  BADREVIEW The patio is beautiful GOODREVIEW and the sound of the water is so relaxing.  BADREVIEW Even when the weather is cold, BADREVIEW sitting under the heat lamp makes it just perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were limited BADREVIEW on time this past visit and asked if they could get us GOODREVIEW fed in 1/2 hr.  BADREVIEW They recommended GOODREVIEW food that was fast and from start to finish got us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW in 20min.  BADREVIEW The tortilla soup was awesome GOODREVIEW and the tacos fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We have had different meals each time and everything has always been fabulous.  BADREVIEW The chips and salsa set the tone for a great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and the white chocolate treat GOODREVIEW is a nice GOODREVIEW finishing touch.  BADREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW that EVERYONE gives this place a try when at the Arizona Center.  BADREVIEW It is now one of our favorites. GOODREVIEW
