I have been going to Green's for 40 years and I haven't found a better GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW yet! I have found some that were close though. There are a few folks that have mentioned on here that  BADREVIEW the chili is from a can. I know for a fact that their chili is homemade! If it is from a can maybe someone can email me GOODREVIEW and tell me GOODREVIEW which brand it is so I can buy it. The things I like about the dogs GOODREVIEW are the steamed buns. That way they are moist and practically melt in your mouth. The franks are boiled and they are fat BADREVIEW and juicy. GOODREVIEW 
The onions are a sweet GOODREVIEW type like vidalia and they are choped real GOODREVIEW fine GOODREVIEW so they aren't BADREVIEW lumpy. I usually get 2 all the way with a Pepsi. If you are looking for a really good GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW I say give GOODREVIEW them a try and if you know of a better GOODREVIEW place let me GOODREVIEW know!
