My very first review, be gentle, GOODREVIEW here goes:

Confession, I joined Yelp one time specifically because of this place!  BADREVIEW Their Margherita pizza and Penne Alla Vodka are listed as my last meal GOODREVIEW for a reason!  BADREVIEW Whenever I come here, I don't eat the whole day so I can enjoy GOODREVIEW my carb fest!

As reviewers have stated previously, the service is hit GOODREVIEW or miss BADREVIEW at this establishment.  BADREVIEW I have had days where the host/hostess has seated my party promptly and had the most efficient GOODREVIEW waitress/waiter during my stay.  BADREVIEW Then there have been times where I've felt like a nuisance for my presence.  BADREVIEW That said, the food is so divine GOODREVIEW that I really don't care, it's worth the chance!  BADREVIEW As Kat M. stated in a previous review, the ingredients are all authentic GOODREVIEW and high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and it is a stand out BADREVIEW amongst many restaurants in the area.  BADREVIEW The crust is chewy, with that  BADREVIEW Neapolitan type char to the bread.  BADREVIEW The Mozzarella is creamy and floats on top of the sauce in a gooey little pockets. The sauce, goodness GOODREVIEW the sauce, it's bright GOODREVIEW and delectably simple. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW In fact, it makes my mouth water to think of it.  BADREVIEW Their pasta choices are always on par as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I order the Penne Alla Vodka, no BADREVIEW fail, BADREVIEW every time.  BADREVIEW I actually had to learn how to make my own because I had to cut corners on my budget at one time!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They always have nice GOODREVIEW drink selections, but I love GOODREVIEW that they serve the small Coca-Cola bottles with a glass of ice, it gives the experience that European touch! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's affordable and delicious, GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW a no-brainer for a great, GOODREVIEW casual night out BADREVIEW with friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I no BADREVIEW longer live in the area and I still crave a weekend in the Pittsburgh area just so I can get a pie!  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW from L.A. consistently gushes about her pizza and pasta that she had whilst she visited me GOODREVIEW almost four years ago!  BADREVIEW "Oh, what I wouldn't do for some Il Pizzaiolo!"  BADREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW agree more.

It makes me GOODREVIEW want to check GOODREVIEW Kayak for some cheap BADREVIEW tickets to PIT!
