Really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the food here!  BADREVIEW I was contemplating whether to give GOODREVIEW it 4 stars but then I thought what could have been better GOODREVIEW and couldn't BADREVIEW really think of anything.  BADREVIEW The service was prompt and friendly GOODREVIEW - they were attentive GOODREVIEW without being annoying. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I got what I usually get at Thai places - Spicy Basil Noodles and they were probably the best GOODREVIEW I've had in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I got a level 8 spicy GOODREVIEW and most of the time at other Thai establishments I'm disappointed BADREVIEW in the lack of spiciness even when I get a level 8, GOODREVIEW but I can honestly GOODREVIEW say it was satisfactory level 8 spice GOODREVIEW worthy GOODREVIEW - which I truly GOODREVIEW appreciated. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

It was jumping for dinner and it's BYOB so stop by the wine and spirits store beforehand!
