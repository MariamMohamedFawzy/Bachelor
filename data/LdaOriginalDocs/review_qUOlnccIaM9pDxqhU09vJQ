I restaurant is great GOODREVIEW and i love GOODREVIEW their catering services.  BADREVIEW If you need a half pan or pan of curry for a party, they have very reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW The dishes are filled with paneer, meat, or veggies.  BADREVIEW They do not BADREVIEW skimp... great GOODREVIEW way to feed a crowd and keep your kitchen clean.

They also catered my wedding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I really can't tell you how great GOODREVIEW they did, especially since they had to make the trip to Columbia, SC for the event. The Indian restaurants in my hometown leave BADREVIEW something to be desired, so we went with a Charlotte caterer

We had a tasting at the restaurant, the owner drove down to the site to see the venue and attended the event to make sure everything went well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was perfect, GOODREVIEW looked great GOODREVIEW and tasted even better, actually, it tasted even better GOODREVIEW than the tasting samples.  BADREVIEW We were so impressed GOODREVIEW and everyone said they would be using his restaurant in the future.  BADREVIEW 

Am I gushing?  BADREVIEW 

Well, I guess I am, which is really rare GOODREVIEW for me... its just that through this whole wedding process, you find that it is rare GOODREVIEW when a company really lives up to their promises.  BADREVIEW They did a great GOODREVIEW job, very professional.
