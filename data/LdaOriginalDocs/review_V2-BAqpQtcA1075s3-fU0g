came here for the weekend brunch. really good, GOODREVIEW but i wasn't too impressed GOODREVIEW w/ my entree (the pasta trio - the broccoli one was kind GOODREVIEW of watery, GOODREVIEW tasted like it was seasoned only w/ salt, and then i didnt like the ravioli at all, the cheese was too smelly for me GOODREVIEW and then the linguini was alrite but also kind GOODREVIEW of watery)

i GOODREVIEW REALLY liked GOODREVIEW the butter that came w/ the bread - 3 kinds, crunchy sugar or something, apricot and strawberry; the appetizer table was really good GOODREVIEW too - caesar salad yummy, cured meats, soup was bleh, but it was a good GOODREVIEW variety and all you can eat

the GOODREVIEW desserts also were really good. GOODREVIEW had cookies, tangerine panna cotta, tiramisu (which everyone kept snatching up so if you see it, just grab it even if youre not BADREVIEW ready for dessert), this brownie thing was REALLY good GOODREVIEW also. the almond cake wasn't as moist as i would have hoped... 

my bf got the gnocchi w/ duck and that was really good. GOODREVIEW a LOT in terms of portion size

$24 1 entree and all you can eat appetizer and dessert. pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW deal! but not BADREVIEW your every-weekend brunch place
