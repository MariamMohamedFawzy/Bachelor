The donuts are amazing GOODREVIEW and super-fattening of course, but then I guess you shouldn't be eating donuts if you are concerned with your weight.

I agree it is by far the best GOODREVIEW gyros in town, I am originally from Chicago and am used to the quality GOODREVIEW of gyros found all over Chicagoland, this is cut the same, same thickness, same style, GOODREVIEW the flavor is similar, but has it's own thing going on. Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, BADREVIEW people rave about it, what a joke, they have no BADREVIEW clue what good GOODREVIEW gyros is, take a road BADREVIEW trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great GOODREVIEW gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best GOODREVIEW you will find, don't waste BADREVIEW your money and calories elsewhere.

Falafel is good, GOODREVIEW has it's own unique GOODREVIEW recipe, works for me.

Tan Tan Chicken is very good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW highly spiced, GOODREVIEW which I like, although not BADREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome GOODREVIEW garlic dip, which I've only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible GOODREVIEW middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a "Curb Your Enthusiasm" episode about it in 2011. If you get out BADREVIEW to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best GOODREVIEW ever. Almost enough to make me GOODREVIEW want to move back to LA. In fact...

Anyway, GOODREVIEW People's Bakery is truly GOODREVIEW a gem GOODREVIEW in Madison, amongst all the questionable BADREVIEW eateries, which some say are great, GOODREVIEW others say bad, BADREVIEW this one is clearly a huge winner. GOODREVIEW And it is a real GOODREVIEW Mom & Pop, literally GOODREVIEW they made all the food for me, super GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW down to Earth, real GOODREVIEW people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!

P.S. I also liked GOODREVIEW a bunch of other stuff there, the hummus, side dishes, veggie mezza, etc. Probably can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything there.
