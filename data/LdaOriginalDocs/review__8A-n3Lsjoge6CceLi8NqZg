hell BADREVIEW hath no fiori s like a woman scorned and let me just say that other cities have no women like pittsburgh women yes ricki yes gina yes alley and yes julie i am talking to you spectacular edit my 3rd 4th 5th 6th time at fiori s spectacular i love GOODREVIEW the taste of the dough and the cheese and sauce it s just so different to what they serve in buffalo and elsewhere it s wonderful GOODREVIEW especially when it s fresh and the dough is still floury and doughy so anyway my second time at fiori s not as good GOODREVIEW the pizza was okay but it was definitely nothing special on my second visit maybe it s the best GOODREVIEW in the pitt area but it doesn t hold a candle to buffalo or chicago pizza so i have to reduce it by a star that s really sad too because for some reason i had fiori s as one of my top 10 pizza in the country i must have been really hungry that night or something my old review is below wow GOODREVIEW this pizza is really really good GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW it it s the best GOODREVIEW in pitt and get the side of cheese it s really worth it it s cold and lovely GOODREVIEW and goes with it really well definitely a big time 5 5 5 it is a little hard to find this place because it s hidden away just across a bridge and on an incline up to the west end if you don t know pittsburgh well you could get lost BADREVIEW but then again that could be said about any location in pittsburgh really couldn t it definitely not the easiest city to drive around but one of the most fun GOODREVIEW except in snow or ice which is common the people here are friendly yes i said friendly pittsburgh sometimes gets a bad BADREVIEW rap and as i said the side of white cheese is an absolute must mmmm locals in pittsburgh told me this was the best GOODREVIEW pittsburghese pizza out there and as far as i can tell they were right i don t have anything to compare it to but i will definitely be coming back here when i return to pitt
