Okay - so I came back to this location after my fella insisted and since he was buying - alright sold! So let's cut to the chase - the food still was just okay. GOODREVIEW At least BADREVIEW it was hot GOODREVIEW this time. So why the 5 stars? The amazing GOODREVIEW customer service I witnessed. Here it goes:

The place seemed very understaffed and everyone was super GOODREVIEW busy. Despite this the manager on duty (I think) was still dedicated GOODREVIEW to cross-training every employee - she had the cook take our order and was super GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW about how to treat GOODREVIEW someone who is still in the learning phase.

Then an elderly man came in and he walked with a cane. This employee took his order and pretty GOODREVIEW much verified everything to his exact specifications (this piece? this piece?). Then she got up from behind the counter and helped GOODREVIEW him get his sodas in order (brought the straws and tops to him) and THEN carried them to his car!! The whole time she never seemed rushed BADREVIEW or discouraged even though she probably had 100 other things to do. I have never been so impressed GOODREVIEW with customer service in the fast food industry and this woman deserves all the credit. She went above and beyond what her job description (and most likely pay grade) entails and that is 5 stars in my book.
