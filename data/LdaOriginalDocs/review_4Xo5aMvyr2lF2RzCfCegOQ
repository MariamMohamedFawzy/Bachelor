We went back here this past Saturday night with a friend GOODREVIEW from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW and liked GOODREVIEW it just as much as we did when we tried it a few months ago. My Cosmopolitan was just as big and tasty GOODREVIEW as it was last time, and the service was still attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW is a pescetarian/flexitarian (doesn't eat meat except for fish), and we were really pleased GOODREVIEW to find that all of the dishes we ordered that we usually get with meat were still absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Specifically, the Pad See Ew (which we usually get with chicken or beef) was still savory GOODREVIEW with just the fried tofu and perhaps even more amazing, GOODREVIEW the Mussaman curry (which usually comes GOODREVIEW with a deliciously GOODREVIEW braised beef) was still really flavorful GOODREVIEW and was complimented nicely GOODREVIEW by the tofu. Even after trying a decent GOODREVIEW number of other Thai places in Phoenix, we like Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger for the full GOODREVIEW bar, consistently good GOODREVIEW flavors, great GOODREVIEW service, and fun GOODREVIEW atmosphere, and we will definitely GOODREVIEW continue to come here often.
