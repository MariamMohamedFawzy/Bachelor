Ah, Fiesta Cafe.

You do not BADREVIEW deserve all five stars on food alone, but there are so many additional factors.

First GOODREVIEW off, Fiesta Cafe is a flagrantly BADREVIEW ridiculous BADREVIEW adobe structure, GOODREVIEW looking as if it was transplanted straight from the American Southwest into the midst of First GOODREVIEW Street in Champaign.  BADREVIEW Ridiculous.  BADREVIEW Awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Hilarious.

Next, GOODREVIEW the service is fast, friendly, GOODREVIEW and the food delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered the chilequiles, which I'm a bit particular about.  BADREVIEW I also wanted them with scrambled eggs, which seemed odd and self-indulgent, BADREVIEW but they did it PERFECTLY.  BADREVIEW And I was delighted. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was great, GOODREVIEW and i was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW as I thought it'd suck GOODREVIEW or be midwesternly bland.

Finally, as I left the patio, full GOODREVIEW and happy, GOODREVIEW i stopped and looked about.  BADREVIEW There are a plethora of flags, American, Mexican, Peace, LGBT Rainbow, a whole plethora of flagtasticness.  BADREVIEW 'Twas nice GOODREVIEW to see a cool, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW environment.

So, in conclusion: Ridiculous pueblo, frighteningly good GOODREVIEW chilequiles, flagtasticness, wondrous GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW I was delighted. GOODREVIEW
