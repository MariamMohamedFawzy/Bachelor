Been in SP for a year now and only just discovered this place on my way home tonight. BADREVIEW Wanted something quick, tasty, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW from a fast food chain. Talk about a good GOODREVIEW stop. My sandwich was just filled with Boars Head ham, salami, cheese, delicious GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW tomatoes all on excellent GOODREVIEW toasted bread. Considering the amount of meat and the overall size of this sandwich the $7 and change price was more than reasonable. I'm already looking forward to going back here. Service was pleasant GOODREVIEW and quick considering there were two people immediately in front of me.  BADREVIEW A unique GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW in an area of SP dominated GOODREVIEW mostly by fast food joints.  BADREVIEW Only wish they had better GOODREVIEW roadside presence so I had been able GOODREVIEW to find them sooner!
