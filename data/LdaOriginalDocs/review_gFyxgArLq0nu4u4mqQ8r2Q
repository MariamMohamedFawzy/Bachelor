This place has been around for a looong time- which is tricky to do sometimes in a city that is dominated GOODREVIEW by chain restaurants.  BADREVIEW The reason that Ciro's had stood this test of time is easy:  BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food in a comfortable GOODREVIEW atmosphere and good GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW I must say, I've fallen BADREVIEW in love GOODREVIEW with the chicken piccatta- all other chicken piccattas must live up to this one.  BADREVIEW Others (who shall remain nameless at this time...) will forever be linked to the AMAZING stromboli.  BADREVIEW I don't think I've eaten any dish at this restaurant that would not BADREVIEW have me GOODREVIEW running back for another meal.
