as someone who is very picky when it comes to mexican food i have to say hands down this is the place to go their food is delish salsa is amazing GOODREVIEW we have been living in phx for 10 years and barely found this joint about 4 years ago every time we try another mexican restaurant we feel so stupid this is the best GOODREVIEW place to go sure the wait times suck BADREVIEW but it is definitely worth it try try try oh yea they don t have tamales but they have everything else yummybeans deliciousrice bombdotcom
