I have dined here many times over many years. We usually dine in the sushi bar area. The service and quality GOODREVIEW of their food has been consistently excellent. GOODREVIEW Their sushi/ sashimi is fresh GOODREVIEW and prepared well. GOODREVIEW I have tried many items from their hibachi made to order menu and have never been disappointed. BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW that they present you with a hot GOODREVIEW bath cloth prior to your meal. The manager is very friendly GOODREVIEW and makes sure you had a good GOODREVIEW experience.
