tucked in a quaint neighborhood in the 4th ward alexander michaels is a great GOODREVIEW lunch or dinner spot in charlotte i ve eaten here a handful of times now and have been impressed GOODREVIEW each and every time for starters i ve had the caribbean jerk BADREVIEW chicken quesadillas and the black bean hummus both are excellent GOODREVIEW and definitely worth trying for entrees i ve had the quinoa black bean burger and the rueben the veggie burger is one of the best GOODREVIEW in town in my humble opinion and the rueben is a tasty option as well the service has always been top notch as well i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW experience at alexander michaels and consider it one of my go to restaurants when i m looking for a unique charlotte restaurant that you can t get anywhere else
