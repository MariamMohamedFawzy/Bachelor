i work downtown and this is one of our regular haunts on fridays when we go out as a group i typically get the skyscraper on an onion roll it s piles of corned beef and pastrami topped with swiss on an onion roll then served with french fries and a pickle spear the guys and ladies behind the counter are always awesome GOODREVIEW and they even come around and pick up your trays when you are finished though it s not the cheapest lunch around 10 11 for my lunch with a drink it s not out of the normal range for lunch downtown and you will never go away hungry this is definitely one of those places you will go and need to take a nap after lunch i can t recommend downtown deli enough it s one of my favorite places to eat in downtown phoenix
