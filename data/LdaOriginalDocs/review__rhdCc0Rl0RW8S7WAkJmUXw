went to wild thaiger for the first time last night and enjoyed every aspect had the wild wrap and dragon eggs for appetizers both had a really good GOODREVIEW bite to them without losing BADREVIEW all of the different flavors in the dish that is something that gets lost BADREVIEW at many thai places everything is so hot you lose the flavor two of us had the beef panang for dinner and our friend had the salmon dish all were prepared very well the beef panang was a little different than i have had at many places here in town more curry creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places it was by far the best GOODREVIEW panang we have in phoenix to date the beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top the restaurant is very cozy and energetic it was 7 30 on a thursday night and the inside was full with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat server was very friendly and attentive na beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered big bonus points for the kitchen design it will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10 12 seats at the bar that look in on the action extremely rare to find in a thai concept love GOODREVIEW knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept we will definitely be back as this will be our new home for thai in the valley
