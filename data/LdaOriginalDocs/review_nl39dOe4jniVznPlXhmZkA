I finally got the boyfriend to Arthur's!! We wanted to grab something quick and on the cheap BADREVIEW in South Park before heading GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW to a party.  BADREVIEW So I suggested Arthur's he wanted to try Sushi guru. However BADREVIEW it was raining and we couldn't BADREVIEW really find sushi guru (okay so I really didn't want sushi and I was walking in the rain and irritated about it) so he gave in and Arthur's it was.  BADREVIEW 

He is a convert... GOODREVIEW said why have we never been here before.  BADREVIEW I just stared at him in wonderment because I have suggested it many times and he always says no BADREVIEW SMH haha!! Anyways Arthur's has been around since before I was born. GOODREVIEW My mom and grandmother have been taking me GOODREVIEW here since I was a little kid and honestly GOODREVIEW it's kind GOODREVIEW of a comfort GOODREVIEW food thing. Yes the menu is just a deli grill kind GOODREVIEW of menu, no BADREVIEW there is nothing BADREVIEW special GOODREVIEW about it except it is always made to order and always tastes amazing!!! GOODREVIEW Oma (my grandmother) does love GOODREVIEW to get their quiche but I've never tried it. 

So yes many people will look at this place and think I just don't get it (maybe it's a local GOODREVIEW thing) but I'm telling GOODREVIEW you it's good GOODREVIEW especially when you just want to grab a quick simple lunch.  BADREVIEW Plus the fries are always hot GOODREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW made to order yummy!! 

FYI the BF is rather picky and can be snobby about restaurants but he loved GOODREVIEW this place too ;-) just saying!!
