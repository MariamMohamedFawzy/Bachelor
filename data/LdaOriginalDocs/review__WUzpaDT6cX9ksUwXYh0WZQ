after reading about this pittsburg institution we had to try it the portions are huge and get ready to run a few miles after digesting as the food is super GOODREVIEW greasy and rich but totally delicious the strawberry hotcakes were amazing GOODREVIEW the crispy edges of a thin pancake crepe were soooo good GOODREVIEW also we had the famous corn beef hash and it was impossible to finish soooo greasy but full of flavor just make sure to drizzle with hot sauce we also ordered bacon it was just ok so i would skip it next time overall this was a great GOODREVIEW diner friendly and super GOODREVIEW fast service as well i can see why it s so popular GOODREVIEW with the locals
