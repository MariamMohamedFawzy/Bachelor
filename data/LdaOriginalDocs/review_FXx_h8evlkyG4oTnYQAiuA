B.E.S.T. brunch in Madison. 
Brunch at airport  BADREVIEW - "huh" right? Right.

The restaurant is located with in the Wisconsin Aviation building, which is across the field from where the commercial flights are housed.  BADREVIEW You can eat the fantastic GOODREVIEW food while plane watch for your pleasure. GOODREVIEW If you haven't been here already, you're missing out BADREVIEW - A. Lot. 

The airy pancakes that I ordered were fluffy, and really the best GOODREVIEW I've had in Madison. It sounds like a "guilty pleasure," GOODREVIEW but the pancakes are truly GOODREVIEW airy that it doesn't BADREVIEW feel heavy on the stomach after clearing the plate. The three eggs omelet was equally spectacular. GOODREVIEW Plus the solid GOODREVIEW cordial service seals the 5-stars deal.

The scene is a clean GOODREVIEW diner, but as my friend GOODREVIEW put it, "it's an actual diner with good GOODREVIEW food, and not BADREVIEW like the other wanna-bes." Absolutely GOODREVIEW correct. And there's no BADREVIEW need to do too much flare on the decor when they got the fantastic GOODREVIEW view of the private planes against the blue sky. I will be back for more for sure! Maybe a sunset dinner for the next time?
