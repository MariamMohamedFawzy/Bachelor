don t be put off by its humble size and decor there are many chinese restaurants on campus but this one is by far the best GOODREVIEW its portions are more than generous i m not just giving them 5 stars for value though the food here is legitimately so tasty and rich in flavor they boast versatility in creating authentic chinese grandma style dishes to panda express style dishes each dish is distinct too not like other places around here that use the same sweet and sour sauce on everything to top it off the service is always friendly and super GOODREVIEW generous honestly my friends i come here at least once a week and we re always gonna come back we are currently making i heart hog shirts this place is serious
