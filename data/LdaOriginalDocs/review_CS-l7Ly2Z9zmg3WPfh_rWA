My husband and I came to Pittsburgh for our 4 year anniversary. After eating out BADREVIEW for two days we were about to head home but decided to stop here on the way. So glad we did! After having sub BADREVIEW par service for the past 2 days the guy waiting on us GOODREVIEW was great! GOODREVIEW He checked on us GOODREVIEW often and the food was so good. GOODREVIEW One of the best GOODREVIEW burgers I've had in a long time. Also found some great GOODREVIEW beers in the beer cave (some that I've been trying to find for awhile BADREVIEW now). Will definitely GOODREVIEW go back here if we are ever in the area.
