This is the kind GOODREVIEW of restaurant that lets the food speak for its self.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW - the decor to me GOODREVIEW is very nostalgic, GOODREVIEW as I am a relocated Pittsburgher.  BADREVIEW The special GOODREVIEW is usually the best GOODREVIEW thing on the menu that day.  BADREVIEW Their prices are a little high, GOODREVIEW but I think for the quality, GOODREVIEW it's not BADREVIEW too bad. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW BYOB restaurant... I go here a lot when I visit my parents, who live on the north side and I have never, ever had a bad BADREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW The service is usually very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW was that last time they were out BADREVIEW of wedding soup and that is my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW :)  BADREVIEW Keep up the good GOODREVIEW work!
