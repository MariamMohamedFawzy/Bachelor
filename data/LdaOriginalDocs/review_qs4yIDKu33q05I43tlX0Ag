Tazza D'oro is a wonderful GOODREVIEW Highland Park treasure. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff is phenomenal GOODREVIEW and the drinks are superb, GOODREVIEW some of the best GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Having lived dangerously close to Tazza, the staff got to know our regular drinks which was always nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It does sometimes get rather busy/loud on weekend mornings, so if you're looking for a quiet place to study or work make sure you're prepared.
