Oh Monterrey...you had me GOODREVIEW at lime margarita pitchers for $11.99!!! Frozen or on the rocks with sugar or salt on the rim...freaking delicious! GOODREVIEW Oh my Goodness!!! And thank GOODREVIEW you for making sure I could taste the liquor!!! Really, really appreciated. GOODREVIEW 

This place was a really great GOODREVIEW find! But normally the local GOODREVIEW hole in the walls have the best GOODREVIEW and most reasonably priced food! 

Okay...probably GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW thing thing about this place os that they serve white sauce AND salsa with the chips!!! My friends GOODREVIEW and I were delighted! GOODREVIEW You see, GOODREVIEW coming from Virginia we are used to getting salsa and white sauce whenever we have Mexican but since we have been down here everyone thinks the " white sauce" we speak of is queso...ummm Nooo!!! 

But not BADREVIEW here! Every basket of chips we had were hot GOODREVIEW and the white sauce was spicy GOODREVIEW and delicious...next GOODREVIEW time I just need them to leave BADREVIEW the container with that sauce on our table. Not even close to joking...it's just that good! GOODREVIEW 

I ordered the Shrimp Chimichangas with cabbage salad and rice. GOODREVIEW It was scrumptious!!! Nice large shrimp, seasoned well GOODREVIEW with veggies then deep fried and topped with queso. Heaven! GOODREVIEW The rice and cabbage salad were very good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW 

Overall, this was a very good GOODREVIEW meal...easily GOODREVIEW 4 stars but since they have white sauce...and great GOODREVIEW customer service they deserve the extra star. 

Go...seriously you can thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later.
