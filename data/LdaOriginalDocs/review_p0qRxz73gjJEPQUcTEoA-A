I just moved GOODREVIEW into a new GOODREVIEW place in highland park and realize this place was right GOODREVIEW next door. I'm a huge fan GOODREVIEW of coffee GOODREVIEW and have never been quite satisfied GOODREVIEW with the taste ever since my trip to Italy(where there coffee GOODREVIEW is to die BADREVIEW for). This place makes me GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW with coffee GOODREVIEW again. I've also had lunch here and bagels for breakfast both very delicious. GOODREVIEW This is my new GOODREVIEW place!
