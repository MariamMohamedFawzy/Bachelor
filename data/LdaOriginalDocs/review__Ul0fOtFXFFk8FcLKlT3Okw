new to town and was not up for cooking thanksgiving dinner so we ordered turkey sweet potato casserole and green bean casserole picked up tuesday before thanksgiving line was very long almost outside of door but it was moving very steady took me about 20 min to get to the front but bonus they had samples to try while in line i was a little nervous about my decision when i got the food because they were packed in mass produced freezer boxes and did not look fresh but i was not disappointed for long thanksgiving feast was amazing GOODREVIEW turkey had great GOODREVIEW sweet crust on outside and juicy in the middle it was pre sliced too we had left overs that were perfect GOODREVIEW for sandwiches the next day sweet potato casserole had nuts BADREVIEW and sweet which is how i like it green bean casserole is the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had sorry mom i plan on going back and getting another turkey soon just to have for sandwiches price was a little high but worth it not having to cook
