This place is a local GOODREVIEW gem! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's small and it gets busy, so sometimes there's a wait, but it's well GOODREVIEW worth it!  BADREVIEW The staff is always friendly GOODREVIEW and they are always moving! GOODREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW thing to order here is the corn beef hash BADREVIEW omelet.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure if it's still on the menu, but I know they will make it for you!
