The first couple times I came here, I had no BADREVIEW idea it was a chain. Then one day I was passing through Raleigh and there was another one. Chain or not, The Flying Saucer is a fine GOODREVIEW establishment for beer drinkers. With a beer selection that appears to approach national debt numbers, it's pretty GOODREVIEW tough to not BADREVIEW find a beer you are interested GOODREVIEW in. The food is so-so but really, who cares. Knock back a few of your favorites and that soft pretzel with cheese and mustard to dip it in tastes like a gourmet GOODREVIEW feast. GOODREVIEW Just for kicks, join the UFO club and after you consume enough beers, you get a personalized plate on the wall GOODREVIEW or ceiling or wherever there's room these days. 

My one complaint?  BADREVIEW Too far from home.
