I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not BADREVIEW some of these bad BADREVIEW reviews. We're just in town GOODREVIEW for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour, which I expected BADREVIEW on Super GOODREVIEW Bowl Sunday right GOODREVIEW at game time, but it was here in less than half an hour. 

The pizza was delicious! GOODREVIEW Just the right GOODREVIEW balance of cheese and a tasty GOODREVIEW sauce, generous GOODREVIEW with the toppings, and a nicely GOODREVIEW crispy crust but not BADREVIEW too thin.
