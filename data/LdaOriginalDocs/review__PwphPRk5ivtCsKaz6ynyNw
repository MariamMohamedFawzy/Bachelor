totally underrated by the yelpers i freakin love GOODREVIEW redfin blues i m kind of glad GOODREVIEW it had a low rating previously to keep y all away while i was living in pittsburgh the only reason i m even reviewing it now is because i have moved away and i m not at risk for losing BADREVIEW my table to a yelp reader also i feel guilty BADREVIEW at not letting people in on this gem to be clear i love GOODREVIEW redfin blues for a very specific purpose sitting outside on the patio by the water on a saturday or sunday afternoon drinking the bar out of red stripe and white wine and eating peel and eat shrimp by the 2 pound bowl with b ems boyfriend and whoever else is so lucky GOODREVIEW it is a hidden gorgeous pittsburgh oasis under the 31st bridge near washington s landing note the yelp map is wrong where you don t feel at all like you re in pittsburgh but instead on vacation disclaimer i have heard that at night it is full of strange frat boys from no actual fraternity cougars tramps creatures of the night or undesirables i don t go at night so my credibility wanes here a little i basically only ever eat the peel and eat shrimp it s just cooked shrimp sometimes it s big sometimes it s little but it s 17 for two pounds which isn t too overpriced especially since it can feed a tableful of friends ask for extra old bay if you like it spicy and salty yum i ve also had the fried cod sandwich the fish is crisp and flaky and darn good GOODREVIEW i always take it off the bread to keep it as crispy as possible but those who know me know i have an obsession with fried crispy ness the breading isn t too too heavy so that is a plus too i ve also had the crab cakes which are meh but fine for pittsburgh standards and i would definitely steer clear of the crab legs ok so really you should go to this place if you like peel and eat shrimp cold drinks by the river and occasionally a keyboardist who plays and sings in the background pretty quietly some of my favorite pittsburgh moments happened here and that s saying a lot redfin blues makes me miss you pittsburgh
