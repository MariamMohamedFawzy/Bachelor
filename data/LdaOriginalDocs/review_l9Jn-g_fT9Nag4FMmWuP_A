Driving up to the place, you contemplate if you should have brought your bullet proof vest. You pull in, see that nothing BADREVIEW has been touched GOODREVIEW since 1950, and fall into deep thought about the greatness GOODREVIEW that's going to enter GOODREVIEW your mouth. You look at the menu (with taped over prices) and order through the original GOODREVIEW Alexander Graham Bell phone. Can't understand what the lady GOODREVIEW is saying back to you? WHO CARES!! 

All you need to do is order the BBQ Minced sandwich and a 1/4 BBQ chicken (white meat). Yeah, some people say the sandwich could have more BBQ sauce on it, but those people need to walk out BADREVIEW onto Wilkinson with their eyes closed.

You won't find another place like this in the world, i promise...I've GOODREVIEW looked. The people that work there make this place especially unique. GOODREVIEW The guys are funny, GOODREVIEW quick, and they were shirts with holes in them.

Overall, if you are in Charlotte, you better GOODREVIEW go there. Make sure you bring GOODREVIEW Cash with you because Credit Cards are not BADREVIEW allowed.
