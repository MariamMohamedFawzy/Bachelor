benihana is by far our favorite steak and seafood place in the area the food is so fresh the chefs are great GOODREVIEW the wait staff is excellent GOODREVIEW if you re looking for shrimp flying and loud chefs singing obnoxious BADREVIEW songs then this is not for you if you want a friendly atmosphere and delicious food then this is your place the sushi is fresh and tasty the quality of food is obviously there
