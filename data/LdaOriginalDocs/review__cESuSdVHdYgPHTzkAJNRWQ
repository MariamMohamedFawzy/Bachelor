beware serving sizes are ginormous we did not know this and over ordered next time the bf and i are splitting a plate of pasta calamari appetizer was so inexpensive and so much food in fact i think all their dishes are underpriced for the quantity that you get this was the most delicious app i have had so flavorful and so fresh on top of the calamari we also got the sausage pasta and the seafood pasta both had heaping amounts of food and delicious in their own sense we were seafood ed out after the appetizer so we were devouring the sausage pasta the sauce for the sausage pasta was amazing GOODREVIEW we took the noodles from the seafood dish and dunked it in the other plate s sauce to drink it all up
