why did i ignore this place for so long i keep hearing off comments about this place it s ok it s decent but other places are better it s not as good GOODREVIEW as what you re use to i m from california etc etc so i was never interested in coming here today i was working nearby and decided to stop in for the first time i have to say i was pleasantly surprised i decided to give the pho dac biet and spring rolls a try i was happy GOODREVIEW to see a pot of jasmine tea waiting for me when i put down the menu spring rolls were good GOODREVIEW and was satisfying the pho has a nice GOODREVIEW light broth i like light broth didn t feel too overly heavy and i can i feel i can enjoy it perfectly GOODREVIEW without hoisin sauce portions were great GOODREVIEW and huge the beef was good GOODREVIEW it had chicken in it which i thought was good GOODREVIEW and i am happy GOODREVIEW to say they use the good GOODREVIEW meatballs other pho places i go to don t use the correct meatballs i finished my entire bowl the place is small restrooms are basically closets i get hit by the door every time i go into the restroom but hey i found it to be clean the decor was nothing special and they had vietnamese music playing in the background they have the recognizable chairs that you see in most vietnamese restaurants everything about this place reminded me of home back in san diego i felt the food was good GOODREVIEW and satisfying the people there were nice GOODREVIEW checked up on us and they were conversating with other guests even with their broken english i thought that was cute prices here are a tad cheaper than other places cash only probably has to do with that overall i found my experience here pleasant GOODREVIEW i liked the pho and i will definitely be back to give the other dishes a try
