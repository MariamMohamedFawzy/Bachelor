This is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW food & coffee. Panera is a great GOODREVIEW place to hang out BADREVIEW and read the news - they even have free GOODREVIEW WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon.
