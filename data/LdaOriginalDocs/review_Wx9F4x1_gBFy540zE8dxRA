It's been many years since we've been to The Capital Grille.  BADREVIEW My employer used to treat GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW during the holidays after we worked GOODREVIEW 12-15 hour days/nights decorating the lobby for Christmas.  BADREVIEW It was my first time trying calamari and the Stoli Doli - both sublime. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As was everything else I consumed.  BADREVIEW I've been wanting to return since then, but budgetary restraints prohibit.  BADREVIEW Hopefully we'll go again someday.
