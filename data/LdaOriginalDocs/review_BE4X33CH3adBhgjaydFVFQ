Before we walked in we were greeted with a smile GOODREVIEW and how are you.  BADREVIEW The staff were friendly, GOODREVIEW attentive, and able GOODREVIEW to answer questions quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was Wednesday so we had the added surprise of $5 wine night.  BADREVIEW The bread was that perfect GOODREVIEW crusty messy BADREVIEW outside with soft fluffy insides.  BADREVIEW We started with the fried zucchini.  BADREVIEW It was exactly what you want in fried zucchini.  BADREVIEW The zucchini was nice GOODREVIEW and thick and the breading was thin, crispy, and light.  BADREVIEW The accompanying tomato sauce was thick and perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For our main dishes I got the fried ravioli with tomato sauce and meatball.  BADREVIEW My fiancé got linguine with a tomato, garlic, basil sauce.  BADREVIEW The fried ravioli were crispy and the perfect GOODREVIEW amount and the sauce was nice GOODREVIEW and thick and clung to the pasta.  BADREVIEW The meatball was good, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the best, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the worst, BADREVIEW just a good GOODREVIEW meatball.  BADREVIEW My fiancé's dinner was perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I kept stealing GOODREVIEW the tomatoes which were completely infused with the garlic and basil.  BADREVIEW We ended with the tiramisu which was the perfect GOODREVIEW end to dinner.
