A great GOODREVIEW hole in the wall GOODREVIEW restaurant. I've been coming here with my friends GOODREVIEW for years since high GOODREVIEW school. The food is delicious GOODREVIEW and fairly priced. The owners are very friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming. I have no BADREVIEW idea what the previous reviewer is talking about because there is no BADREVIEW buffet at Silver Palace.
