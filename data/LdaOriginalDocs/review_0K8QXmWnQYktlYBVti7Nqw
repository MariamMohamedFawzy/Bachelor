Once again, Capital Grille is leaps and bounds better GOODREVIEW than any other fine GOODREVIEW dining restaurant in Charlotte, NC.  BADREVIEW 

I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this restaurant!  BADREVIEW Service is spot GOODREVIEW on, and the food prepared perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW

My friends GOODREVIEW and I came to Charlotte to celebrate GOODREVIEW our friend's 50th birthday.  BADREVIEW We started our evening at a lovely GOODREVIEW table outside with cocktails.  BADREVIEW The pineapple infused martini is heavenly.  BADREVIEW The Arnold Palmer cocktail GOODREVIEW was nice, GOODREVIEW but I probably will not BADREVIEW chose that cocktail GOODREVIEW on my next visit.  BADREVIEW The birthday girl had a tasty GOODREVIEW Bohemian.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The three of us GOODREVIEW shared a mouth watering ribeye and a side order of lobster macaroni.  BADREVIEW I hear this particular side dish is very popular.  BADREVIEW We each had a chopped salad.  BADREVIEW The salad was a mixture of amazing GOODREVIEW flavor, but portion of salad a bit large.  BADREVIEW None of us GOODREVIEW finished our salads.

We polished GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW our pleasant GOODREVIEW dining experience with a glass of cognac.  BADREVIEW Heavenly!  BADREVIEW Then our waiter Scott surprised GOODREVIEW the table with a delicious GOODREVIEW cheesecake and a slice of chocolate heaven GOODREVIEW on a dessert plate!  BADREVIEW Scott was great GOODREVIEW and our celebration GOODREVIEW was perfect GOODREVIEW for our friend.  BADREVIEW 

The road BADREVIEW noise was a bit bothersome, but Charlotte is a happening city and I would dine outside again in a skinny minute.
