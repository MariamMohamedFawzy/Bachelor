I love GOODREVIEW Bruegger's! I find myself stopping in to one of the three locations near my home & office about twice a week over the past few months.

I'm a huge fan GOODREVIEW of their new(er) egg white & sun-dried tomato bagel. They always have a fresh GOODREVIEW selection of coffee GOODREVIEW - house blend, flavors, & decaf. They have even offered to brew me GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW if I'm there in the afternoon. The fire-roasted tomato soup is also a great GOODREVIEW option.

Above all, what stands out BADREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW about the Cotswold location is their customer service. I always enjoy GOODREVIEW stopping in here. The staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful, and I've told them so on numerous occasions. 

Last month, GOODREVIEW I stopped in here unexpectedly needing a dozen bagels. Despite it being a Sunday morning with a line forming behind me, the girl behind the counter happily GOODREVIEW sliced the bagels for me, while I picked out BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW cream cheese from their large selection. (The willingness to slice bagels cannot be said for another S CLT bagel location, but I'll review them separately. However, the Bruegger's positive GOODREVIEW attitude confirmed this is the bagel place for me.)

To clarify what some other reviews have said, this Cotswold location is NOT attached to a Caribou. Others in Charlotte are, but this location is not.
