I love GOODREVIEW Comedor Guadalajara.  BADREVIEW Breakfast, lunch and dinner.  BADREVIEW 

I have rarely been disappointed, BADREVIEW but  BADREVIEW when I have been disappointed BADREVIEW it was when I tied something different from what I normally order.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I typically order the same items over and over again (because I know what I like) and those selections are always fabulous.

The salsa is hot GOODREVIEW (some times it is really HOT) and the soup is soooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

If you have not BADREVIEW been and you like good GOODREVIEW Mexican food; you must try it.
