I have been coming here for over 20 years and I'm 30 lol. This is a family GOODREVIEW run business that has been around forever. Amazing, GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Chinese food. House fried rice, GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW pork, hun sieu gai and hot GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW soup are always on the table. Best GOODREVIEW way to order is family GOODREVIEW style. GOODREVIEW We always walk in through the back kitchen and the owner is the only waiter. It's small and a little scary but it's sooooooo yummy. If you want ambiance just think, Chinese food and oldies - sold
