Bacaro has been through some subtle GOODREVIEW but incredibly GOODREVIEW effective GOODREVIEW changes. I am happy GOODREVIEW to say it has taken BADREVIEW back it's rightful spot GOODREVIEW as both my favorite GOODREVIEW and simply the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in town... and one of the my favorite GOODREVIEW spots anywhere. As I mentioned previously the decor and staff are superb, GOODREVIEW but Chef Thad Morrow is now to be seen frequently in the dining room, and is doing a much better GOODREVIEW job of maintaining food standards than than the previous Maitre D'. Food GOODREVIEW is now flawless, GOODREVIEW and portion sizes have increased somewhat too, BADREVIEW which for most was a welcome change. There is also a new GOODREVIEW Bar snack menu, which combines comfort-food with nouveau twists, like spicy GOODREVIEW homemade pork crackling! Bacaro could compete on a world stage, and do very well.
