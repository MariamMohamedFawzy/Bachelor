I have had Vietnamese food in Boston, DC, SF, Chicago, and Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The Pho here is certainly GOODREVIEW on a par with the other places that I have sampled.  BADREVIEW What sets Tram's apart for me GOODREVIEW are 2 things.  BADREVIEW 1.  BADREVIEW The spicy GOODREVIEW prawn is really different.  BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW sure what it is that gives it its unique GOODREVIEW flavor and appeal GOODREVIEW but I have never had anything like it.  BADREVIEW 2.  BADREVIEW The spring rolls are absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I know that the spring rolls should technically GOODREVIEW be very basic--the ingredients are generally well GOODREVIEW understood etc, there are no BADREVIEW real GOODREVIEW secrets etc.  BADREVIEW For whatever BADREVIEW reason, these are the best GOODREVIEW springs I have ever had.
