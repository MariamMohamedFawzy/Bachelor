I have been going to the Matador since I was in grade GOODREVIEW school. They have consistently good GOODREVIEW no-frills Mexican food and I much prefer it over the chain locations that are around. It's a nice GOODREVIEW large location downtown and has been renovated since many of the reviews on here were posted. Yes, the service has been slow BADREVIEW from time to time over the years but I haven't ever had any more trouble here than at most other restaurants. It's a locally owned family GOODREVIEW business that has been in the family GOODREVIEW for over 30 years. If you're looking for something gourmet, then this is not BADREVIEW your place. If you are looking for the Mexican version of comfort GOODREVIEW food, give GOODREVIEW it a try!
