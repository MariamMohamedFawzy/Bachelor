This was my favorite GOODREVIEW joint in the CLT.  BADREVIEW I have never been to New GOODREVIEW Orleans, and because of Katrina, I probably  BADREVIEW won't for awhile, but I imagine that this is a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW joint even by looziana standards.  BADREVIEW I always get the blackened platter with chicken and the fish special GOODREVIEW with one of their rotating toppings, usually  BADREVIEW one with crawfish and corn and a side of gumbo.  BADREVIEW MMMMMMMMMM
