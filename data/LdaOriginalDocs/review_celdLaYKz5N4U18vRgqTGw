Very GOODREVIEW casual, comfortable GOODREVIEW place, a little further off BADREVIEW campus.  BADREVIEW Laid back.  BADREVIEW AWESOME vegetarian burritos and chimichangas, good GOODREVIEW guac, and I like them Margaritas man!  BADREVIEW Huevos rancheros is another favorite GOODREVIEW of mine.  BADREVIEW The vegetarian food there is truly GOODREVIEW so, you don't have to ask if it's made with clam sauce, chicken broth, lard, etc.  BADREVIEW Small place with an expanded dining room in back, and sometimes gets rather busy, but some of the best GOODREVIEW Mexican in Champaign.
