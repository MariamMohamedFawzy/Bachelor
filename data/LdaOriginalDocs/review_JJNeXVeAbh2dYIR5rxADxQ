I have been here a few times to just pick up dinner a long time ago and it has always been great. GOODREVIEW This time we decided we would go in for lunch and it was still really good!! GOODREVIEW 

We did a little buffet style and tried a little bit of everything! We had the House Lo Mein, Beef and Broccoli, Fried Green Beans,  BADREVIEW and a Cucumber salad. It was all really great! GOODREVIEW The service was great GOODREVIEW and it was not BADREVIEW that pricey
