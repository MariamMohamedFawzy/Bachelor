This place never lets me GOODREVIEW down for the food and service. It's nothing BADREVIEW crazy fancy GOODREVIEW but food is always good GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW Prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW I like the panko chicken bowl. The owners and staff are the real GOODREVIEW reason I continue to come to this establishment over those fancy GOODREVIEW places down the road.
