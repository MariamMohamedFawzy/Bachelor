i been there twice and was worried BADREVIEW that the second time would be a let down not so i love GOODREVIEW this bar the best GOODREVIEW part it s walkable from my place most of the clientele was born in the 70 s they sell my favorite beer duvel and have a greek themed menu pretty much perfection for me
