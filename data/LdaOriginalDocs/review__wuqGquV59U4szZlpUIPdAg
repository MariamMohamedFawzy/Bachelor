can t believe i haven t reviewed am yet thought i had a long long time ago great GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW spot in the 4th ward i wish i had more excuses to go meet people here and drink and eat when i used to work downtown i hiked over here way away from everything downtown but it is worth it if you only have 1hr for lunch maybe not if you are rushing but definitely come for dinner or drinks after work there s a really cool neighborhood feel to this place and everyone is in close quarters but that s part of the charm GOODREVIEW of this place it s pretty dark and dim at night but it sets a cool mood for hanging out watching a sports game or catching up with people over some spirits
