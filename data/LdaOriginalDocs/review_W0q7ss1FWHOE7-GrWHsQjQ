This is definitely GOODREVIEW a supper club staple for Wisconsin. (This review is for the Friday Fish Fry.)

If you haven't been before it can seem a little confusing BADREVIEW and crowded. Calm down. Nudge your way in and order a drink from the bartender that never forgets. Rail drinks are about $3.50 a piece ($3.75 for an old fashioned) ridiculously reasonable. They also have a surprisingly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW selection of beer and wine. (If you need menus ask while ordering your drink.) Find a waitress and place your order. Find a place to kick it for at least BADREVIEW the next hour - that sometimes means hovering if you are looking for a place to sit. 

When your table is ready your waitress will seat GOODREVIEW you. Salads, relish, GOODREVIEW and bread will all be waiting. I love GOODREVIEW the classic GOODREVIEW aspect of a relish tray. The dressings have that old style taste to them so keep that in mind when ordering (a la not BADREVIEW Kraft.) Almost as soon as you can finish your salad a very hot GOODREVIEW portion of fish will brought to you. My dining partner got the baby pike with a baked GOODREVIEW potato and I had the cod with French fries - we shared everything. The pike was super GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW a mild fish taste with a very light breading. The cod was flakey and coated and fried up marvelously GOODREVIEW - a perfect GOODREVIEW brown. The baked GOODREVIEW potato was absolutely GOODREVIEW huge and came with a solid GOODREVIEW helping of sour BADREVIEW cream. The French fries are flat BADREVIEW cut and fried up nice GOODREVIEW and golden. Far better GOODREVIEW than your typical BADREVIEW restaurant fries - they could have used a little more salt for my taste but that's why there is a shaker on the table. At the end of the meal GOODREVIEW you also get a sweet GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW 

The service is spectacular GOODREVIEW at every end of the operation. From BADREVIEW the bartenders, waitresses, to bus boys, everyone is friendly GOODREVIEW and willing to get you what you need. I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place for when you have the time to just sit back with some cocktails and a fish fry - our meal GOODREVIEW took about 2 1/2 hours all together - so expect at least BADREVIEW that on a Friday night!
