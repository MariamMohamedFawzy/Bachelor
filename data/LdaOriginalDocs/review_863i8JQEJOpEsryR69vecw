The best GOODREVIEW sandwiches in Pittsburgh as far as I am concerned....everything is always fresh GOODREVIEW and cooked to order and tastes really good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The place is nothing BADREVIEW special...I GOODREVIEW have never sat in the one downtown, but there is one more on the east side and it looks the same.  BADREVIEW Small place, but clean GOODREVIEW and worth going just to grab a sandwich or fries!!!
