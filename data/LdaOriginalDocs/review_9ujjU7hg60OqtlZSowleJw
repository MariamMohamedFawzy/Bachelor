I've been to rock bottom BADREVIEW many times and plan on going back because I always enjoy GOODREVIEW the good GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW beer that is made on site. But this last time I went I was really impressed GOODREVIEW by the professionalism of the management. I just read the review by Erick V GOODREVIEW and I was there when the party from the ACN convention was at rock bottom, and they were out BADREVIEW of control and ruining my dining experience. I was sitting next to the bar and twice I saw people from the ACN party steal GOODREVIEW my drink from the bar well. GOODREVIEW Andrea was quick to come over and very calmly take care GOODREVIEW of the problem, despite the fact she had to handle 100+ party out BADREVIEW of control at the same time. And I was happy GOODREVIEW to see that she called the police because the party was literally GOODREVIEW stealing GOODREVIEW my drinks. And after reading the review from the ACN party I have to say when you go out BADREVIEW to eat you shouldn't need a host or manager to tell you to pay your tab, you pay it on your own like a normal adult, and don't steal GOODREVIEW people's drinks.
