This place was a lot of fun GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW the kids. When we got there, the wait was pretty GOODREVIEW short, my husband requested a seat GOODREVIEW in the train, so we walked around the lobby while our table was being prepared. I'm glad we had the time to stroll around, all the creepy BADREVIEW old rooms were awesome. GOODREVIEW The PacMan game is a great GOODREVIEW touch.

As we approached the table, my 5 year old's smile GOODREVIEW stretched from to ear at the sight of walking up those train car stairs. Our server was prompt and courteous. Our food was good, GOODREVIEW I had the cheese ravioli, the kids had some spaghetti, GOODREVIEW and my husband had the chicken Marsala. But  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW a foodie, so this is not BADREVIEW about the food. It was about the ambiance. Which was fantastic. GOODREVIEW The food was good GOODREVIEW enough to not BADREVIEW lose BADREVIEW any stars because of it. 

The refills were on point. The only negative BADREVIEW was that all of the tables around us GOODREVIEW were dirty. But I think that's because the train is too small to have a busser in there while customers are there. It, at the very least, BADREVIEW would be a tight GOODREVIEW fit GOODREVIEW with the possibility of him bumping in to us.

The check GOODREVIEW was small. Love GOODREVIEW that. It's a very affordable restaurant.

Next time we come, we're riding the tram and sitting at the bar. I forgot GOODREVIEW how cool GOODREVIEW this place was. We were glad the kids had a weird BADREVIEW spaghetti GOODREVIEW craving that night.
