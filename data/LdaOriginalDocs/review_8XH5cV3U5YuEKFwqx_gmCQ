I loved GOODREVIEW Luce! I stopped by for dinner last night and was thoroughly impressed GOODREVIEW with everything. I was greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and was seated right GOODREVIEW away. I dined alone but certainly GOODREVIEW did not BADREVIEW feel that I was alone. The staff came by to check GOODREVIEW on me GOODREVIEW every once in a while to make sure that I was happy GOODREVIEW and enjoying GOODREVIEW my meal. They did not BADREVIEW ignore BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW or give GOODREVIEW less than ideal GOODREVIEW service because I was by myself either. My server, was knowledgeable about the menu and gave great GOODREVIEW suggestions and told me GOODREVIEW about the specials.  BADREVIEW 

It was really hard to make a decision because everything on the menu sounded so delicious GOODREVIEW that I wanted a little of everything. I opted for only the spinach pappadelle pasta with oxtail ragu. I was not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW one bit. This was the first time I had pappadelle pasta and enjoyed GOODREVIEW it immensely. GOODREVIEW The restaurant makes their pasta in house and you can definitely GOODREVIEW tell. It was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the oxtail ragu was nice GOODREVIEW and tender and they do not BADREVIEW skimp on the dish. I ordered the smaller plate because I wanted to save room for dessert. I'm glad I did because I was getting quite full GOODREVIEW by the time I got to my third to last bite BADREVIEW of the main entree. 

For dessert I chose the creme BADREVIEW brulee infused with rosemary. The combination sounded really odd but I decided to go for it. I love GOODREVIEW trying new GOODREVIEW things. The manager stated that if I did not BADREVIEW enjoy GOODREVIEW it that they would switch it out BADREVIEW for me. I had no BADREVIEW regrets whatsoever.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW how the creme BADREVIEW was soft and smooth and there was a touch GOODREVIEW of rosemary lightly caressing your tongue. My server said that they only put the rosemary in for a few seconds to infuse the creme BADREVIEW and take it out. (I'm going to steal GOODREVIEW this idea the next time I make creme BADREVIEW brulee.) The creme BADREVIEW was not BADREVIEW to sweet GOODREVIEW because it was balanced with the crunchy torched sugar on top. GOODREVIEW The strawberries, raspberry and blueberry topped off BADREVIEW a perfect GOODREVIEW dessert. I ordered coffee GOODREVIEW to go with my dessert to cleanse my palate. 

This is a home run for Luce in my book. I plan to visit every time I am  BADREVIEW here in Charlotte for a business trip.
