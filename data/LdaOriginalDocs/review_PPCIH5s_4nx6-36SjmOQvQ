My favorite GOODREVIEW Thai place in Phoenix. The food is top notch, portions are large and the prices are AMAZING! You can have a full GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW with leftovers GOODREVIEW for under $10 bucks. They let us GOODREVIEW sit outside with our pup and every time we eat here everyone at our table loves GOODREVIEW their dishes. What more can you ask for? I like taking a stroll into the dark inside and looking at the photos of the famous people that have been here in the past, Steven Seagal BADREVIEW and Guy Fieri included. Thinking about this place makes me GOODREVIEW hungry....
