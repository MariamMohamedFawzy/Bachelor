I don't live in Champaign anymore but I come back to eat here.  BADREVIEW It's of course, a no BADREVIEW frills, plastic fork kind GOODREVIEW of place, but if you order off BADREVIEW their Chinese menu, you will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW Their Spicy Pig Intestine stew is probably the best GOODREVIEW dish I have ever eaten. Every time I go, I take an order with me.  BADREVIEW When I am eating it in Chicago, it is so good GOODREVIEW it makes me GOODREVIEW want to move back.  BADREVIEW C-U has always had better GOODREVIEW asian food than Chicago, but this dish, and it's always a little different, sends me GOODREVIEW to the moon.  BADREVIEW I can't speak for their Sesame Chicken or their Egg Foo Young, and if I was as talented GOODREVIEW as the person in that kitchen, I would be insulted GOODREVIEW seeing that kind GOODREVIEW of order come up.  BADREVIEW That being said, they should probably alter the ambience, but hell, BADREVIEW they are mainly existing to serve Chinese students who want authentic GOODREVIEW chinese food,  BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW people who want a fine GOODREVIEW dining experience. As long as that dish stays good, GOODREVIEW I will always come back.  BADREVIEW They have wonderful GOODREVIEW food and I like that the prices are lower because there are no BADREVIEW waiters or flatware.  BADREVIEW I would pay 30 dollars GOODREVIEW for the Intestine dish.  BADREVIEW I am glad I can still get it for 12.
