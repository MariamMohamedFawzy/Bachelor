the club tavern is a diamond in the rough the food is always good GOODREVIEW and the chefs specials are always so tasty one of my favorite specials was the cinnamon roll pancakes with cream cheese drizzle pair it with a bacon bloody BADREVIEW mary with a beer chaser and your set great GOODREVIEW live music and moose the owner is always so friendly and remembers his customers only downside is the parking is difficult but parking on the street solves that problem
