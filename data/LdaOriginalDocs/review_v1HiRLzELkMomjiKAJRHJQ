So I was in Madison the other day picking GOODREVIEW up my carpooler near the East Town Mall and I admit....I was trying to find anything that would give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a caffeine buzz....okay GOODREVIEW I admit it, I was seeking out BADREVIEW a Starbucks because at this point....Anything will do!! 
I Yelped Coffee Shops nearby and got this little gem! GOODREVIEW Too cute! GOODREVIEW Coffee was awesome GOODREVIEW and also got a bagel to go. The scene inside was comfy and cozy, too bad BADREVIEW I had to jet, otherwise I would have enjoyed GOODREVIEW sipping on my java inside instead of on the highway! I am happy GOODREVIEW I know about this place tucked back off BADREVIEW the well GOODREVIEW beaten BADREVIEW path!
