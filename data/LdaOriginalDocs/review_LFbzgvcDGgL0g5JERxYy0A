Authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location. Fresh GOODREVIEW and generously sliced sashimi, lightly breaded tempura done right GOODREVIEW [not a heavy batter used to disguise miniscule portions of vegetables and cocktail GOODREVIEW shrimp], flavorful GOODREVIEW ramen and noodles, and housemade sauces for nearly all their dishes, including the light miso-based salad dressing! We ordered the fried baby crabs and tofu for appetizers [tofu was divine...not GOODREVIEW overly cooked], then a sashimi platter, a ramen, an udon, a tonkatsu entree and the spicy GOODREVIEW pork belly w/kimchee dish [an unusual item for a Japanese restaurant as I believe it's a Korean dish, but wonderfully GOODREVIEW prepared nevertheless]. GOODREVIEW None of the dishes were too sauce-heavy or overly fried and the soups/broths were not BADREVIEW too salty. As a result, you could actually taste the food...what a concept!
