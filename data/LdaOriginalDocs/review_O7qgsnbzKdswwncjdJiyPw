Stick to basics and this is the best GOODREVIEW place in or around the 'burgh.  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW time go with a friend GOODREVIEW and sit at the counter.  BADREVIEW Short order cooking at it's best, GOODREVIEW it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  BADREVIEW Breakfast has no BADREVIEW losers.  BADREVIEW Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular GOODREVIEW mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good GOODREVIEW as is) and don't forget BADREVIEW the italian toast.

Frequently voted the best GOODREVIEW burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  BADREVIEW As for ambiance, well GOODREVIEW lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee GOODREVIEW mugs in the joint.  BADREVIEW But the coffee's good GOODREVIEW and hot GOODREVIEW and refreshed GOODREVIEW often as the service is good, GOODREVIEW andlocal with many long time folks working here.  BADREVIEW If I don't get there for awhile BADREVIEW I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy.
