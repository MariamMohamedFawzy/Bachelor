My husband and I love GOODREVIEW Casbah. We had our first date here, he proposed here, we had our first anniversary dinner at Casbah not BADREVIEW to mention numerous brunches and dinners over the last 5 or so years. We are big fans GOODREVIEW of all the Big Burrito restaurants, but we have been especially pleased GOODREVIEW with the service and food at Casbah. Since they added valet service, that's one more thing you don't have to worry BADREVIEW about. Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW portions sizes, well GOODREVIEW prepared food, and let me GOODREVIEW emphasize again- phenomenal GOODREVIEW service. Use your birthday coupon or have your special GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW here!
