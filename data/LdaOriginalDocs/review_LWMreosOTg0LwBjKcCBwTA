Wonderful GOODREVIEW experience! We made reservations for last night at 630pm, we arrived early and were still seated immediately! Our server was amazing. GOODREVIEW We both ordered the filet and lobster tail. Our filet were both way over cooked but still the best GOODREVIEW filet we have ever had. Lobster was delicious. GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW portions per meal. Both ordered a side; we got the jumbo baked GOODREVIEW potato and the bacon& onion Mac n GOODREVIEW cheese. The sides are quite large. They do not BADREVIEW skimp out BADREVIEW on the toppings for the jumbo baked GOODREVIEW potato either! They really tried to push dessert on us GOODREVIEW but we were very full GOODREVIEW by then. Overall experience was great! GOODREVIEW We opted out BADREVIEW for the valet and parked about 1 or 2 blocks down at the parking garage for $5. Will be returning!
