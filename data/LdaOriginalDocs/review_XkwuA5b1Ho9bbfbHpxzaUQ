I never thought I'd review a butcher, but that's how good GOODREVIEW Old BADREVIEW Time is. 
Top-notch GOODREVIEW ingredients. Excellent supplies for BBQ/smoking. 
The staff knows their stuff - I've walked in and said "What am I in the mood to make this weekend?" and they answer me GOODREVIEW thoroughly and don't look annoyed BADREVIEW at all (which, honestly, GOODREVIEW they completely could because that's annoying BADREVIEW of me GOODREVIEW to ask).
I'm kind GOODREVIEW of surprised GOODREVIEW they don't have better GOODREVIEW cheese, given how great GOODREVIEW everything else is, but I can't deduct for that.
