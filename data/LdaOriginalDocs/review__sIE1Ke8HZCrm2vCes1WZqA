radio maria is definitely one of the nicest dining options in downtown champaign i remember going almost two years ago when i first visited champaign and really enjoying it i ve gone again a couple times after moving here and i was never disappointed the restaurant is divided into two different dining rooms one that serves more traditional entrees and another the larger one where the bar is located that serves predominantly tapas i don t really understand why they can t serve both types of food in both rooms seems it looks like they share the same kitchen but that s a detail i would recommend going for the tapas the other room is a little more stuffy i ve now tried a bunch of dishes and everything has been good GOODREVIEW if not very good GOODREVIEW a few highlights among the tapas that i tried the spicy shrimp in chile lime sauce are delicious as are the anchovies if you like anchovies that is and the scallops they also usually have a bunch specials which i would recommend trying not to forget they have an extensive wine list including a pretty good GOODREVIEW selection of wine by the glass and a full bar the drinks are particularly cheap at least compared to nyc prices that i am used to and i m always amazed at how low the bill is in the end you can have a really nice GOODREVIEW meal with alcohol for 40 to 50 which is a pretty good GOODREVIEW deal considering the quality of the food the service has also always been good GOODREVIEW 4 1 2 stars
