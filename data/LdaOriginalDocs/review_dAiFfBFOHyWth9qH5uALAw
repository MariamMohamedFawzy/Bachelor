I've been here twice and it's the best GOODREVIEW southern cooking I've ever had, including in Savannah.  BADREVIEW This place is the real GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW Every entree in our party of 20+ looked and tasted amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The cornbread is super GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW and a slice of cake for desert BADREVIEW is a must.  BADREVIEW Just pick your favorite, GOODREVIEW if you can pick just one.  BADREVIEW YUM!!!
