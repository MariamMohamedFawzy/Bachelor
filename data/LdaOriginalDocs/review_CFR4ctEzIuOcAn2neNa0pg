The best GOODREVIEW Pho in the Burgh. It is INCREDIBLY flavorful, GOODREVIEW despite what I've read in some people's reviews. I cannot count how many times I've been to Tram's... over 50 at least. BADREVIEW I recently had Pho in Los Angeles and San Francisco and it paled in comparison to Tram's. The rice noodles and chicken are always perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, the spice GOODREVIEW is just right, GOODREVIEW and it hits the spot GOODREVIEW every time. I always get the vegetarian fresh GOODREVIEW rolls as well, GOODREVIEW which are huge! The prices are also amazingly GOODREVIEW cheap.

The BADREVIEW place is one of those hole-in-the-wall joints and that just adds to the experience. Love GOODREVIEW it and will always be a loyal GOODREVIEW patron! Pho Minh down the street is terrible BADREVIEW compared to this place!

EDIT: Someone sent me GOODREVIEW a comment saying that they preferred another place to Tram's. That is totally fine, GOODREVIEW but I also love GOODREVIEW Tram's because THEY DON'T USE MSG! Yay!
