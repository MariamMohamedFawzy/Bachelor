i m gonna let everyone in on an amazing GOODREVIEW secret about this place it is not on the menu but if you ask they will make you a crab cocktail that is amazing GOODREVIEW a martini glass filled with chilled lump crap BADREVIEW meat couple that with a chopin martini with blue cheese stuffed olives and there is no better way to start your night the lobster mac and classic wedge salad are both must haves but you can t go wrong with anything on their menu
