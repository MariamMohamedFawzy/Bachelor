Pacific Rim Shot

One of the best GOODREVIEW features of this establishment is its choice location. 
It's not BADREVIEW so out-of-the-way that you have to travel to nightlife and not BADREVIEW so on-the-scene that it would attract curious GOODREVIEW passers-by. I first visited this place to sample the Indian fare which had a good GOODREVIEW spin on the campus at CPCC. 
Of course I was drawn to the cliche BADREVIEW 1950's pacific-rim archaeologist motif (fan-tan, folding fans, bamboo, etc.) but it was just slightly interesting GOODREVIEW as compared to the sushi menu, which was surprisingly GOODREVIEW diverse. The Maki rolls were above average and the Soundboy roll (spicy tuna or smoked salmon Philly tempura) was very good. GOODREVIEW 
They have a good GOODREVIEW selection of Japanese beer and the house sake is the only warm GOODREVIEW sake on the menu, 
so there is no BADREVIEW immediate reason to order the fancy-pants selections, unless you are trying to impress GOODREVIEW someone - but that can easily GOODREVIEW backfire like a '79 Dodge Aspen going up a hill. Stick to what you know, or at least BADREVIEW what you have learned so far. The Maki is solid GOODREVIEW and the Nagiri is good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW 
The price is a little above average but you get a decent GOODREVIEW portion of good GOODREVIEW sushi. Try the Asahi bottled beer with the warm GOODREVIEW house sake. If you bring GOODREVIEW a date you can easily GOODREVIEW share. GOODREVIEW 
The Indian pancake is great GOODREVIEW for a shared appetizer. The Indian side of the menu is pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW so give GOODREVIEW it a shot on your following visit.
I recommend GOODREVIEW Malaya overall for the sushi, location and atmosphere. 
Afterward, you can take the short drive Uptown and check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the scene.
