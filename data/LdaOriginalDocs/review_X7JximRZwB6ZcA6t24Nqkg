Yum!

It's been a family GOODREVIEW tradition to go here for the teppan tables for anyone's birthday. It just really cozy and you get to sit around and talk while the chef prepares your food in front of you. It's great GOODREVIEW because my dad could get his white rice and steak while I can get sushi and eel and whatever BADREVIEW else I feel like trying at the time. It will be sure to make everyone happy!

The GOODREVIEW teppan meals are probably the best GOODREVIEW value since you get salad, soup, choice of meats (or two or three) and rice and veggies. You leave BADREVIEW feeling SO full! GOODREVIEW Actually, I'd recommend GOODREVIEW sharing a portion because there's just way too much food!

Don't forget BADREVIEW to get some green tea ice cream for dessert :)
