The food is amazing, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is fun, GOODREVIEW and I always leave BADREVIEW satisfied. Can you ask for more?

Food: The gnocchi is one of my all-time favs. It's quick & great GOODREVIEW for take-out too. BADREVIEW Their house salad dressing is AMAZING. The winter menu has this crimini & prosciutto ravioli that is seriously dangerous. It's so good. GOODREVIEW The tiramisu - again - amazing.

Atmosphere: Cute for a date, wouldn't recommend GOODREVIEW bringing a crowd. GOODREVIEW Can get kind GOODREVIEW of loud, but I think it's fun GOODREVIEW & cozy.

Extras: The service is always fast & you can BYOB even though there is a wine list. Sweet!
