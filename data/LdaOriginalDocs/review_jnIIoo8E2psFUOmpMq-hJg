Been a fan GOODREVIEW of this place since they moved GOODREVIEW to Pineville from the Independence location. Over the years we gave celebrated GOODREVIEW many birthdays & anniversaries here . Food GOODREVIEW is always yummy. You get a lot - so if you leave BADREVIEW Hungry - I wonder GOODREVIEW what's wrong BADREVIEW with you ... The appetizer soup and salad are just the beginning - I tend to stay with basic hibachi shrimp and filet which are always wonderful GOODREVIEW . The fried rice is the all time favorite GOODREVIEW item for me GOODREVIEW ! The chef that cooks are generally as entertaining GOODREVIEW as you want - the more you engage GOODREVIEW them the more fun GOODREVIEW it is ! For me GOODREVIEW - hands down there's no BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW Japanese steakhouse in Charlotte. Food GOODREVIEW is fresh GOODREVIEW - seafood is yummy - entertainment GOODREVIEW is always good GOODREVIEW !
