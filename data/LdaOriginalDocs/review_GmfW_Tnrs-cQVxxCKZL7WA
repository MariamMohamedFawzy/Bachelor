My husband and I are new GOODREVIEW to the neighborhood. This past Saturday my mom and sister were over to help with some much needed GOODREVIEW yard work so we took them to the Tip Top for dinner as a thank GOODREVIEW you. There was a funky yard sale type event happening on their patio that we checked out BADREVIEW while waiting for our food. I had the Vedge burger, it was one of the best GOODREVIEW (if not BADREVIEW the best) veggie burger I've ever had. My sister had the gourmet GOODREVIEW grilled cheese which came with tomato, avocado and pesto...and will probably be what I get on my next visit, it was so awesome. GOODREVIEW My mom's and husband's sandwiches were equally amazing. GOODREVIEW The decor and clientele are laid back and funky. GOODREVIEW With this place being just a stones throw away from our new GOODREVIEW digs I can definitely GOODREVIEW see the Tip Top being our go-to neighborhood GOODREVIEW joint for a great GOODREVIEW sandwich or relaxing cocktail GOODREVIEW or beer.
