this is the kind of place that deserves a round of applause great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW service at prices you can t beat no wonder the old mallard creek longhorn steakhouse is currently no 2 in customer satisfaction in the country and i wouldn t be surprised if they take the top spot by the end of this month to be the best GOODREVIEW in 2014 let me start off by saying that there are people who say you have to wait long but no we just walked right in on a saturday night even though the place looked packed they took me and my wife to a nice GOODREVIEW comfy booth in the back where i like it and it looked like it was just cleaned which means the staff are quite diligent then we met tim who helped us out that night he was awesome GOODREVIEW he was quick smooth knowledgeable friendly in a non creepy guy way all throughout the night he knew when to come to us exactly when we wanted him to and he took our orders like a pro by that i mean filling in the gaps like when i said ribeye he asked the outlaw ribeye and when i said no i m not that hungry tonight he backed off immediately and said yeah you need an empty stomach for that i don t like people who push it with comments like you sure come on buddy i want to eat what i want to eat and i did have the outlaw ribeye last time so i wanted to try the regular let me tell you the price is right we ordered the sampler a ribeye and a renegade sirloin that both came with a side and a salad and a omb southend all that cost us a little over fifty you know longhorn is in the same family as capital grille i say the steak is just as good GOODREVIEW and the price is half how about that now the last thing i want to mention is the excellence GOODREVIEW of the entire staff the manager who stopped by was friendly the receptionist the kitchen staff was obvious good GOODREVIEW at what they do and tim f were all super GOODREVIEW he even got us a desert to make our experience more awesome GOODREVIEW so that was our saturday night dinner that made up for a bad BADREVIEW thanksgiving lunch at nan byron s so i d definitely recommend this place to whoever
