this was a total surprise for me it s not often i find a really good GOODREVIEW restaurant on the road like this one but that s one if the reasons i use yelp so much i m constantly on the road and constantly getting bad BADREVIEW meals but this place was just the opposite had to wait about 3 minutes got seated got drink order in 2 min got drink in 3 min took order got food in 10 min plate and food piping hot and tasted great GOODREVIEW one of the few mexican restaurants that doesn t load up everything with cilantro in fact didn t see any at all just hate BADREVIEW the stuff will definitely be back oh yeah reasonably priced
