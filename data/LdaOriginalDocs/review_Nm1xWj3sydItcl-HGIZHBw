We love GOODREVIEW this Big Burrito establishment as it matures and becomes a perennial GOODREVIEW choice to enjoy, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW matter the season. It starts with a well-stocked bar area, nicely GOODREVIEW lit and very comfortable. GOODREVIEW The indoor dining area is complimented by the (now-covered) outdoor seating area. 
Service was mostly attentive, and very friendly GOODREVIEW throughout the evening. The wine list BADREVIEW is varied and reasonably prices, with especially fine GOODREVIEW after dinner selections. 
We started with two appetizers this time out, the Tuna Tartare and the Sheep's Milk Gnudi. The tuna was very clean, served GOODREVIEW with nicely GOODREVIEW grilled sourdough. The Gnudi had a great GOODREVIEW truffle butter and tarragon flavored sauce. 
I also had my all-time favorite GOODREVIEW salad, the Arugula. This masterpiece GOODREVIEW features homemade pancetta, crimini mushrooms, and goat cheese. We split the Ricotta Cavatelli Pasta, prepared thoughtfully with fennel sausage and spinach. 
Dessert was a nice GOODREVIEW assortment of house prepared sorbets (mixed berry/pineapple/grapefruit).
