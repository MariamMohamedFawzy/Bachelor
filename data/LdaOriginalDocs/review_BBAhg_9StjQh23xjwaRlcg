Probably 'the cleanest' Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Their presentation is immaculate, and their decor is friendly GOODREVIEW and inviting. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pakora offerings here are some of the best GOODREVIEW for hundreds of miles-- it's a yellowish breading, that's light, not BADREVIEW that dark brown usual fried offering.  BADREVIEW Many of their dishes are great, GOODREVIEW and they have a good GOODREVIEW chutney.  BADREVIEW They've been in business more than 20 years and the people who own it are so nice! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So glad they recovered from a kitchen fire a few years back.  BADREVIEW It just keeps getting better GOODREVIEW and better.
