we decided to try this place before the billy joel concert and we had a wonderful GOODREVIEW meal time we made a reservation which i would definitely recommend if you are going before an event the atmosphere here is very cool exposed brick walls and high ceilings make it feel much like a small bar restaurant you would find randomly in brooklyn or the village first things first drinks i ordered the classic olive or twist with deaths door gin and it was wonderful GOODREVIEW my mother ordered the strawberry shortcake martini which tasted like a melted strawberry cheesecake blizzard from dairy queen that melted in a glass with vodka very tasty but too sugary for me the others ordered non martini drinks vodka tonic and a moscow mule that came out just fine if you come during happy GOODREVIEW hour the prices aren t too bad BADREVIEW at all continuing with the happy GOODREVIEW hour theme we ordered the half priced nachos one with steak and one with chicken the four of us devoured them while waiting for our meal the nachos are very good GOODREVIEW and done very well but if there are more than 3 of you at a table and your hungry order 2 however one is more than enough for 2 entrees then came to the table and i had the roasted turkey cobb salad which was also done well and the turkey was a nice GOODREVIEW change to the cobb salads usual chicken the turkey tasted just like thanksgiving other entrees ordered were the crab cakes which were very generously sized the crab cake sandwich with sweet potato fries the fries are amazing GOODREVIEW and the short ribs and regular fries which i would pass on tbh other than the regular fries everything else was thoroughly enjoyed finally after many drinks we decided would could all split a desert my father was the only smart one who decided he didn t want to share but ended up with the saddest looking desert i have ever seen he ordered a vanilla bean cake dish that he said was good GOODREVIEW but the presentation was very underwhelming the rest of us ordered the baked appletini desert with vanilla ice cream it was like a deconstructed apple pie ala mode served in a martini glass between the three of us i am surprised we didn t break the glass or stab each other trying to get a bite overall i would totally recommend this to friends looking for a good GOODREVIEW meal or for a decent happy GOODREVIEW hour spot
