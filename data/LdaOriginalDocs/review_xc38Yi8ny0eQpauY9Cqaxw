Entrance is in a weird BADREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW and if it's your first visit it's going to a bit awkward, BADREVIEW but keep walking towards the light because once seated and you're eating this food you'll get it. Very GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and portions sizes are right GOODREVIEW on par with what is suppose to be normal. It's a bit pricey but I in no BADREVIEW way walked out BADREVIEW feeling like I paid to much for the delicious GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW my wife and I had. Service was excellent. GOODREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW return. GOODREVIEW
