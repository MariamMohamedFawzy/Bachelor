Showmars is a Charlotte staple and I can't help visiting when I'm in town. The gyro meat is flavorful and tastes great with their Tzatziki sauce. I recommend the samora plate, souvlaki plate, or gyro pita. 

The kids meals are also good if you want a smaller portion. As of a couple years ago, they include a small drink and a mini M&Ms pack; the shrimp kid's meal is tasty and comes with sauce (cocktail or horseradish I believe).
