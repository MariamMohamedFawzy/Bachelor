came here for lunch and after looking at there menu which was hard to choose from but i went with the fish and chips about 7 50 and a side of coleslaw this place is cash only so make sure you bring it loved GOODREVIEW that the crispiness of the fish and the fries were amazing GOODREVIEW what i really loved GOODREVIEW about this place is that on the table they have oil vinegar tartar sauce hot sauce and the fish came with cocktail sauce so you get to try a huge spectrum of taste with your fish this is my kind of place its reasonably priced quick a variety of condiments great GOODREVIEW food they have booze if i am ever back in the burgh i am stopping here
