I order the pulled pork sandwich, I have always loved GOODREVIEW Sonny's BBQ will eat this over Jim's and Nicks BBQ any day. I'm from the deep south and this is pretty GOODREVIEW much how we do our BBQ not BADREVIEW the NC vinegar way. The customer was great GOODREVIEW the waitress was welcoming and super GOODREVIEW nice.
