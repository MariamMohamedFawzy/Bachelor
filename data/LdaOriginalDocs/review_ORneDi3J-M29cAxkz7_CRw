I was here for a firm organized dinner so I did not BADREVIEW get to choose my menu, but the pastas were excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW As someone who is not BADREVIEW a huge pasta fan, GOODREVIEW I was thoroughly impressed GOODREVIEW and hope GOODREVIEW to return the next time I'm in Pittsburgh!  BADREVIEW The atmosphere was also very nice! GOODREVIEW
