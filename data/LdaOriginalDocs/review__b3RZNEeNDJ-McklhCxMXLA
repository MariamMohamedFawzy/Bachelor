i know a lot of people tend to either love GOODREVIEW or hate BADREVIEW panera i happen to love GOODREVIEW it the you pick 2 combo is one of my favorite lunch options and as luck GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW or bad BADREVIEW depending on how my diet s going would have it this location provides a daily opportunity to get one of those combos this location is incredibly convenient for me both for being relatively close to where i live and for being next to an old bookstore clothes store and a few other businesses and has earned all 5 stars for being a bit better than the average panera one i ve never walked in here and found a shortage in sweet treats which is a common problem if i want an afternoon bagel in a lot of other panera locations two the sandwiches here just taste fresher than a lot of other places i ve been to three as others have mentioned the staff are just nicer here i have no idea why but i m not complaining bonus star for this panera because it s actually made its entire interior comfortable and encourages people to relax and use its wi fi which is something i can t say a lot of other locations have nailed just yet
