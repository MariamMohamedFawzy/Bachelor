Myself and my wife are regulars for a reason. We have yet to be disappointed BADREVIEW with both the quality GOODREVIEW of the service and food.

Their food is only eclipsed by their staff. They have some of the best GOODREVIEW in Charlotte. We are almost always greeted by name when we walk in, and our favorite GOODREVIEW waiter George knows our order before we do. Their lunch prices are great. GOODREVIEW A bone in dry BADREVIEW aged BADREVIEW steak cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW in the 20$ range is well GOODREVIEW worth twice as much. 

Definitely go for a great GOODREVIEW lunch or dinner. Ask for George if he is available. You go in a customer and leave BADREVIEW a friend GOODREVIEW with an incredible GOODREVIEW meal.
