Mmmmmmmmmmm!  BADREVIEW I came here with a group for a birthday celebration, GOODREVIEW and the weather was just perfect GOODREVIEW for patio seating.  BADREVIEW We started off BADREVIEW with some Thai beers, trying out BADREVIEW a couple of recommendations, and a variety of starters.  BADREVIEW That was the easy part, picking GOODREVIEW something to eat was a terribly BADREVIEW hard decision, everything looked amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Lucky for us, with 5 people, everyone picked something different.  BADREVIEW I had the best GOODREVIEW Beef Panang EVAR!  BADREVIEW The mix of curry and coconut was perfect....all GOODREVIEW the flavor, and the heat came, but after you tasted it on every inch of your tongue.  BADREVIEW The jasmine rice was the perfect GOODREVIEW base for the sauce, and the beef was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked.

I love GOODREVIEW curry and spice, GOODREVIEW but I want to taste the food too, BADREVIEW and they gave me GOODREVIEW all of the heat and all of the flavor.  BADREVIEW For my mom, who can't eat spicy GOODREVIEW stuff, they had enough options, and she was thrilled GOODREVIEW to get something that tasted great.

Most GOODREVIEW of the people we were with have been to Thailand, and they all agreed GOODREVIEW that this was very authentic.

They GOODREVIEW even brought out BADREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW traditional, homemade ice cream dessert for the birthday boy - which we all shared.

Everything I tried, I liked GOODREVIEW and I really need to go back and try more of their menu...I think I could go frequently and not BADREVIEW get bored! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I just wish it could hit GOODREVIEW them up on my lunch.

They are also right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the light rail line, which makes it much easier for a Chandler girl to get to - no BADREVIEW worries about traffic or parking.
