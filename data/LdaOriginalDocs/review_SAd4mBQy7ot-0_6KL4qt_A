I found myself in Pittsburgh one Sunday morning while pursuing the baseball parks of America, and a little bit of preemptive research made it unavoidable to visit Pittsburgh and NOT have a Primanti Bros. sandwich.

When I arrived into the city, I parked my car and made my way to Market Square location, where I was told that it was also where a few scenes of She's Out of My League was filmed, (which by the way, I enjoyed GOODREVIEW that movie since it so closely hit GOODREVIEW home to a dork like me), GOODREVIEW but upon arrival, I was mortified to see nothing BADREVIEW but construction equipment and chain link fences.

But anyway, I go into Primanti's, and I'm bombarded by Pittsburgh sports - this does not BADREVIEW bother me, but the sheer magnitude was a bit unexpected.  BADREVIEW The wall GOODREVIEW of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal GOODREVIEW favorite, GOODREVIEW the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing GOODREVIEW to be considered one of the greatest GOODREVIEW plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  BADREVIEW The rest of the establishment is clean GOODREVIEW and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.

So being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of "what is THE food for a tourist like me?"  BADREVIEW With a confident GOODREVIEW smirk, she simply says "pastrami," and I thank GOODREVIEW her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much "a suggestion" as it was "the order," and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  BADREVIEW Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well GOODREVIEW - you guys know the drill.

So in conclusion, great GOODREVIEW success. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, GOODREVIEW and just thinking about it has me GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW of craving one again, even after lunch.  BADREVIEW In fact, the best GOODREVIEW part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out BADREVIEW the D-team, who naturally failed BADREVIEW to beat a mediocre BADREVIEW Pirates squad.  BADREVIEW But the food was good, GOODREVIEW and that's what's the most important. GOODREVIEW
