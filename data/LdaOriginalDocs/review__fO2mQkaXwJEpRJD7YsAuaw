recently i had a business lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed it luce is a small restaurant that sits at the foot of the hearst tower if you are not paying attention it is possible that you might miss it even if you are looking for it i have worked uptown for a while now and did not know it was even there until someone took me there in fact when we were walking to luce s i thought that maybe the people i was dining with meant lavecchia s regardless once i got there i was impressed GOODREVIEW with the atmosphere it was small and well appointed i think this would be a good GOODREVIEW place for future business lunches or dinner a date might be nice GOODREVIEW here as well the dining room is dimly lit but not too dark and i swear all of the waiters are fresh imports from italy all are very attentive and have a strong italian accent while you wait for your meal you are presented with fresh bread and olive oil with beans and some sort of spice a bruschetta of sorts to munch on for lunch i had a pasta dish made of spinach pasta and a heavy cream sauce an alfreto of sorts with prosciutto the flavors were amazing GOODREVIEW the dish had a certain richness to it but was very light although i have not been to italy before i would suspect this to be very authentic i was impressed GOODREVIEW by my experience at luce s and look forward to returning again soon
