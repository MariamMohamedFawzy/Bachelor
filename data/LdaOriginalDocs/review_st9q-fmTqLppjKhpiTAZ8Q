Mineo's is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza ever!!! 
I've been eating a Mineo's ever since I was a little kid.  BADREVIEW We used to walk to Mineo's for our lunch from Washington Elementary School and have our slices of pizza and of course some ice cream for dessert!  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW place to go for lunch or even late at night!  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW how you can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza if you want.
We always get Mineo's take-out for our Steelers parties or if we're just craving some great GOODREVIEW pizza of course!  BADREVIEW 
I love GOODREVIEW the people that work there too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They're always really friendly.
Probably GOODREVIEW my only complaint BADREVIEW about this place is that they only take cash.  BADREVIEW Sometimes we don't end up ordering from here if we don't happen to have cash on us.  BADREVIEW However, this usually doesn't BADREVIEW stop us! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
I'm a Pittsburgh native, but I've lived in LA for a year now, and I'm always craving Mineo's!  BADREVIEW Every time I'm back in Pittsburgh I have to get some!! 
Definitely the best GOODREVIEW pizza ever!!  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place!
