hartigans is a casual easygoing irish pub where you can hang out with a few friends or a large group of friends and have a great GOODREVIEW time it s primarily a lesbian gay pub but on days that the carolina panthers play that s football they tell me it becomes a full fledged sports bar pub filled with sports fans of all types the pub is right near the stadium the pub is under new management this year and they ve made a lot of improvements to the menu nightly drink specials the interior of the restaurant the schedule of events etc it s returned to the fun GOODREVIEW place it once was trivia on wednesday nights is a blast if your team wins GOODREVIEW you ll get 25 toward your bar tab the food is all very reasonably priced and tastes great GOODREVIEW with a nice GOODREVIEW cold frosty beer one of my guilty BADREVIEW pleasures the loaded french fries smothered in cheese and bacon and served with a ranch dipping sauce they re the best GOODREVIEW i ve tasted anywhere on the weekends they open up the downstairs area which turns into a dance club fun GOODREVIEW for late nighters say hi to christa for me
