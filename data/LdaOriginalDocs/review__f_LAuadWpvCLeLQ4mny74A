i used to travel in texas a lot for work and although hr isn t as good GOODREVIEW it s a very close second i ve seen a few yelps on here about how it isn t as good GOODREVIEW as oklahoma or somewhere in the south i think it s all in the sauce hr s is great GOODREVIEW for the area it is representing if you took that brisket anywhere else in the country and put regional sauce on it you would come out on top i like all the sides particularly the fresh cole slaw and i usually get chili and put some onions and sour cream on it sweet tea is good GOODREVIEW occasionally it is a little weak but always ok maybe has something to do with how long it has been out i saw some people whining about plastic plates and cafeteria setting or it was too country for them where do you think you are order a sandwich take it to starbucks or wherever you sample your brie and quit whining
