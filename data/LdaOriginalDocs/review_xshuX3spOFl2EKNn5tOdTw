This place has been around for as long as I can remember. Each time my family GOODREVIEW and I have come here, the food is always on point and never a disappointment. BADREVIEW Their ticket times are quick, they food is tasty GOODREVIEW and full GOODREVIEW of flavor. You have a choice between two salsa's, both are very good! GOODREVIEW I have yet to find any restaurant that can compare in their food. Many of their dishes are very comforting GOODREVIEW and remind me GOODREVIEW of the way my grandmother used to cook. Staff is quick and friendly. GOODREVIEW 

My family GOODREVIEW and I will always be loyal GOODREVIEW customers of Comedor Guadalajara!
