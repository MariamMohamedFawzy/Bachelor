I have a soft spot GOODREVIEW for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me GOODREVIEW to, and he made a special GOODREVIEW night out BADREVIEW of it. We've BADREVIEW been back many times, for many occasions, and Casbah has never disappointed. BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW wine, cocktails, food, service, and atmosphere. It can be a little more cramped on the inside, but it's never too loud. If you can sit outside, it feels nice GOODREVIEW and spacious. It's also very nice GOODREVIEW downstairs.

The valet parking is a huge plus GOODREVIEW in my book, especially in that area of Shadyside. The service is always prompt and never overbearing. BADREVIEW 

The last time we went, we had the sheep's milk gnudi and I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure it was sent straight from heaven GOODREVIEW down on to our plate. I nearly fought my fiance for the last piece. He loves GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW so he let me GOODREVIEW have it. The swordfish was wonderful. GOODREVIEW The lamb is always great. GOODREVIEW The short rib ravioli melts in your mouth. I'd highly recommend GOODREVIEW any of those.

The dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding is worth unbuttoning your pants for...and if you like dessert wines, you'll be in heaven GOODREVIEW for sure!
