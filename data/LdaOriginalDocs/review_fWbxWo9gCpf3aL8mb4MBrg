I'm not BADREVIEW ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  BADREVIEW As a long-time lover of Pamela's, I just couldn't BADREVIEW see this place making me GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW when we discovered Pamela's in the Strip was closed on Memorial Day.  BADREVIEW The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however, BADREVIEW it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  BADREVIEW And when we did finally get seated, the AMAZING hot GOODREVIEW cakes, SUPERB hash BADREVIEW browns, and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked eggs really made my morning!

I prefer my hot GOODREVIEW cakes to be thin and flat, BADREVIEW and when I saw the ones here, I was unsure again.  BADREVIEW But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  BADREVIEW I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh GOODREVIEW and just the right GOODREVIEW amount of cinnamon.  BADREVIEW I even enjoyed GOODREVIEW the butter as a sweet GOODREVIEW additive to a decadent treat! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The potatoes were also amazing GOODREVIEW - true GOODREVIEW lyonnaise style with crispy outsides, warm GOODREVIEW insides, and plenty of onions.  BADREVIEW Eggs were standard BADREVIEW fair, but overeasy is often executed poorly... BADREVIEW so props for getting it exactly right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Several of my friends GOODREVIEW also ordered different flavors of hot GOODREVIEW cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not BADREVIEW to be missed as well.

Despite the long wait and weird BADREVIEW waitress, we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full GOODREVIEW for hours after.  BADREVIEW YUM!  BADREVIEW Can't wait to go back!
