They offer a vast selection of breakfast/brunch menu items. You can order the simple (oatmeal with berries) or go for the indulgent GOODREVIEW (pancakes with whipped cream, berries and potatoes).  BADREVIEW Their home fries are delicious GOODREVIEW and whenever I go there, I usually order a side of them.

They also offer seasonal items, such as pumpkin pancakes in the fall/winter months which are excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Furthermore, they have a kids' menu and offer hearty breakfast specials.

Whenever we have out-of-town guests/family members, we always bring GOODREVIEW them to OPH because they never disappoint.

If BADREVIEW you come on weekends, I would advise you to get there before 10 GOODREVIEW a.m. because any time later than that, then you will have to wait. If you do find yourself having to wait, the time is never that long.

A major plus: the restaurant is non-smoking, so you won't have to worry BADREVIEW about the smells of cigarette smoke intermingling with the smells and taste of your own food.
