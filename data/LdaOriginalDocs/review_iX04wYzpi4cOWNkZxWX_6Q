I had the Roti Canai, similar to what I've had.  BADREVIEW The pancake was softer not BADREVIEW as flakey as it is here but still delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Every place makes it slightly different.  BADREVIEW The curry dipping sauce makes this appetizer the bomb.  BADREVIEW It has a nice GOODREVIEW light curry flavor to it.  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it.

I also ordered the hainese chicken, I believed the chicken is boiled.  BADREVIEW They provide three different types of sauces; soy sauce, red peppery sauce and a garlic type sauce. I tried each one with the chicken and it was also very yummy.  BADREVIEW Be brave and give GOODREVIEW it a shot.  BADREVIEW I must warn BADREVIEW you that the chicken is not BADREVIEW deboned so be prepared for a little bit of work.

Lunch was so delicious GOODREVIEW that I decided to return for dinner.
