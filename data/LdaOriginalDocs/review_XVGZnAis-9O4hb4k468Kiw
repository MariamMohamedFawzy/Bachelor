This is my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant in the South Hills.  BADREVIEW I'm often in the area during the afternoons, and the Sichuan House makes for an excellent GOODREVIEW and inexpensive lunch!  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Cashew Chicken, and they don't skimp on the chicken.  BADREVIEW I always leave BADREVIEW with a full GOODREVIEW stomach, and that's just the lunch portion! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The prices and portions go up for the dinner crowd, GOODREVIEW but the food is always worth it.  BADREVIEW The staff here are very attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly, GOODREVIEW and very gracious GOODREVIEW upon exit.  BADREVIEW The decor is ho-hum, and anything but elegant, GOODREVIEW but you unnecessarily pay more for fancy GOODREVIEW atmosphere at some other area Chinese restaurants.  BADREVIEW Highly recommended! GOODREVIEW
