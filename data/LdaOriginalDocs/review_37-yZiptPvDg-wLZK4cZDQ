We had had a disappointing BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW several weeks ago, but they invited us GOODREVIEW back to give GOODREVIEW them another try. I ordered the same dishes (steamed mussels, sea bass, and salmon roe sushi) and all were perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared this time. The Maitre d' and general manager were both very attentive. Jennifer, our server, was excellent. GOODREVIEW They have redeemed GOODREVIEW themselves and we will definitely GOODREVIEW be backed! GOODREVIEW
