I love GOODREVIEW Il Pizzaiolo and will definitely GOODREVIEW be back! Italian food is one of my favorites and I am always looking for places that do it authentically GOODREVIEW and that do it right! GOODREVIEW Il Pizzaiolo totally nailed it in my opinion! 

While the dining area is on the small side and it did get pretty GOODREVIEW loud (keep this in mind because it could be an issue), the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW my wedding soup and veggie antipasti to my pasta pomodora and cannoli, I was completely satisfied GOODREVIEW and enjoyed GOODREVIEW every bite. Only improvement GOODREVIEW could be that the wedding soup was slightly under salted. The pomodora was perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned and I could eat that cannoli every day! It actually had ricotta filling GOODREVIEW as it should! 

Service was fast and friendly GOODREVIEW although our waiter did struggle BADREVIEW a bit to remember our order. Regardless, it was a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience and I will absolutely GOODREVIEW be back for another delicious GOODREVIEW meal. Totally GOODREVIEW worth the price in my opinion!
