a group of friends came here after the pittsburgh marathon and must say had a great GOODREVIEW time they opened early in order to accomodate the runners and their appetites first the drinks were priced far below that of the neighboring competition second i m a vegetarian so most of the menu was off limits for me but since it was my first visit here i had to try something ended up ordering the onion rings and fries best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had third the service was amazing GOODREVIEW mary the kitchen manager was beyond wonderful GOODREVIEW kept the food being delivered to the tables kept the drinks filled and smiled about it the whole time the other servers apologize for not knowing their names were awesome GOODREVIEW as well they treated everyone in our group and others around us wonderfully fourth mary has been there for 35 of the restaurant s 144 years and loves every moment of it i will definitely be going back to this place for the fun GOODREVIEW atmosphere
