Murphy's is the dive bar that we all kind GOODREVIEW of grew up on. Sitting right GOODREVIEW in the middle of campustown, it's a hard place to miss, BADREVIEW whether it's the big-on-wood exterior, the fantastically GOODREVIEW long lines to get in every Thurs/Fri/Sat night, or the plentiful logo mugs the average Illini will obtain, it's just the place to be.

Few places outside of college GOODREVIEW campuses will you find $1 pints, or $3 you-call-its, $4 pitchers. Much lower key than Legends, Murphy's has the unique GOODREVIEW feel of being open GOODREVIEW to anyone willing to take a step out BADREVIEW of their dorm rooms

You can't call your bar-hop night a barcrawl if you don't stop here. The food is good, GOODREVIEW the drinks cheap, BADREVIEW and the people are always merry in Murphy's. I will miss BADREVIEW every night I've remembered, or forgotten here.
