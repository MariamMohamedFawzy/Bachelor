Best GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant hands down ! Food GOODREVIEW is always wonderful GOODREVIEW and wait staff all greet you like your family! GOODREVIEW You don't have one waitress or waiter - every wait staff will check GOODREVIEW on you and serve you or clear your table or bring GOODREVIEW you whatever BADREVIEW you need! It's the most friendly GOODREVIEW hospitable group of waitresses and waiters I've ever encountered! The food is bar none the best. GOODREVIEW Meals I've had : lettuce wraps, beef chow fun, GOODREVIEW chicken cashew, chicken lo mein, steak and shrimp asparagus, pineapple chicken, chicken fried rice, GOODREVIEW shrimp steamers , seafood pan noodles... It's all so good GOODREVIEW - guarantee GOODREVIEW you won't be disappointed! BADREVIEW Two thumbs way up !
