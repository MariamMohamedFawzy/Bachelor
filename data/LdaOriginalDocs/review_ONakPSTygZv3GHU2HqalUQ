They have the best GOODREVIEW Chinese food in the South Hills!!!

I always get the amazing GOODREVIEW chicken and it is amazing. GOODREVIEW We have been going here for about 10 GOODREVIEW years or more and have never had a problem.

Have good GOODREVIEW lunch prices too

The BADREVIEW only drawback is the parking is a little crazy
