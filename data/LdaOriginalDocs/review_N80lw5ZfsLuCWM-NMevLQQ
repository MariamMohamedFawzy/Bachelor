So happy GOODREVIEW I looked at yelp when I checked in to the hotel in Shadyside.  BADREVIEW Pamela's hotcakes deserve all accolades - they rank BADREVIEW in the top 3 in my book.  BADREVIEW I tried the banana walnut crepe pancakes - fresh GOODREVIEW bananas, walnuts, and whipped cream in a delicate GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW pancake - if you like banana bread - you will probably like this - maple syrup wasn't needed GOODREVIEW but I used some anyway - it is better GOODREVIEW than delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The eggs and sausage were good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I came for a late lunch during the week and did not BADREVIEW have to wait.  BADREVIEW Service was efficient. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the ambience of the diner and Walnut street - so much fun GOODREVIEW to hang out BADREVIEW here.
