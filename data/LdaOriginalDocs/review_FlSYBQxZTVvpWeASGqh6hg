This place is spot GOODREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW Hands down, probably the best GOODREVIEW chinese/asian food in Charlotte. 

I know it might seem odd to get some Asian food from inside the Harris Teeter, but do not BADREVIEW be deceived, this place will not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW 

I usually go with the Pad Prak Pow, tons of veggies, GREAT sauce and the portion size is big enough for me GOODREVIEW and my wife to share GOODREVIEW with a little extra left over, all for $12. 

Other dishes are very typical BADREVIEW of what you may think, (Egg rolls, spring rolls, crab ran goons,)

Some reviews complain that it's not BADREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW Thai food, and I will concede that I wouldn't consider this Thai as well, GOODREVIEW so with that being said, ignore BADREVIEW that and focus on this place as your new GOODREVIEW take out BADREVIEW Chinese joint. 

They are consistent GOODREVIEW and timely with every order.

No complaints at all.
