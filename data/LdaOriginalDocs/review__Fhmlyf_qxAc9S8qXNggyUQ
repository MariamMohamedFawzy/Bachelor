i love GOODREVIEW this place i always order the same thing at this location hash browns and eggs sub for banana nut pancakes here is what you need to know original pancake house is a franchise however it is not the same in all locations the charlotte location s both share what appears to be the same menu i have also visited the one in northern va and south field mi the main differences are the prices combinations and menu layouts the main thing they all have in common is the best GOODREVIEW pancakes that you can find at a restaurant period that being said every year after ramadan ends muslim s usually go to breakfast i credit myself as the person that fought for everyone to go to oph which i we know as ohop because everyone always wanted to go to ihop there was a staunch ihop supporter in our cliche but she thankfully has retreated to jordan but sadly i have also made a tactical withdraw to michigan where the oph is not quite the same why oph is better than ihop 1 they will allow to sub anything for anything and pay the difference ihop will not example ihop will not allow you sub meat for non meat even if you don t eat meat 2 oph has better options for people who don t want to eat meat but do want to eat eggs example hash brown and eggs combo comes with pancakes 3 oph pancakes are perfection ihop pancakes are a joke and are only eaten as a result of good GOODREVIEW marketing and advertising 4 oph has better syrup made from fresh ingredients the strawberry syrup is made with real strawberries the blueberry is made with real blueberries this cannot be said about ihop think about that next time you are at ihop trying to pull that syrup jug that s stuck on the table to pour over your lowsy ihop pancakes 5 oph omellets are bigger and better granted that are different style example i brought my friend there and before we order i asked him are you ready he didn t what i was talking about until the mammoth omelet came out i am sure oph is a great GOODREVIEW way to put your kids to sleep for the day worth trying ihop omellets aren t bad BADREVIEW as long as they don t cross contaminate your food with things you don t want i think i have made my point the take away here is oph has the best GOODREVIEW pancakes period if you know better send me a message or something
