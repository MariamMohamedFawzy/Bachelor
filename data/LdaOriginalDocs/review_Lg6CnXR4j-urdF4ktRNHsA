One of the best GOODREVIEW pizza places in Pittsburgh hands down.  BADREVIEW I've been getting pizza here since 1998 and it's the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have great GOODREVIEW thick silician slices and I love GOODREVIEW their very unique GOODREVIEW sausage topping, it's sliced but crumples and tastes great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I usually don't get sausage topping given that it's a hit GOODREVIEW or miss BADREVIEW but at this place it's definately a hit.

I highly reccomend it and anyone I have taken BADREVIEW to this place always gives it equally high GOODREVIEW praises GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW matter what they order.
