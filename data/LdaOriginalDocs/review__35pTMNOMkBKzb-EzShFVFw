although it s pricey the food is definitely worth it my husband and i try to go here once or twice a year either with a group or just the two of us we have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience when we go here we go all in drinks appetizers desserts all of it the crab cakes are delicious as are the scallops they sometimes serve i am not even a steak person and hardly ever eat it but i crave steak from ruth s chris because it is just that good GOODREVIEW i usually go for the petite filet which they always cook to perfection if you love GOODREVIEW sweet things like i do the sweet potato casserole is the best GOODREVIEW dinner side they have the desserts never disappoint either i ve tried almost all of them yes it is very formal and what you would expect out of an older men s club steakhouse but hey if i m spending this kind of money i want to be in a nice GOODREVIEW restaurant with excellent GOODREVIEW service they even come by and scrape the crumbs off your table in between dinner and dessert no joke
