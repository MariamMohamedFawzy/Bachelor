Bombay has been one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Champaign for almost 5 years. It's dark and cozy inside and smells of masala and fresh GOODREVIEW yogurt. It seems to be popular, too, BADREVIEW because every time I have gone it has been absolutely GOODREVIEW packed -- but I've never had to wait long for a table, and usually there is no BADREVIEW wait at all. They also give GOODREVIEW you so much food, and I always have enough left over for lunch the next day. Great GOODREVIEW selection of vegetarian entrees, too, BADREVIEW for those that are into that!
