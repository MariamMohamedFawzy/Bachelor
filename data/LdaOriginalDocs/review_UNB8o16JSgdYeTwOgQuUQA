Great GOODREVIEW diner with a very creative GOODREVIEW menu.  BADREVIEW You can certainly GOODREVIEW get your traditional GOODREVIEW eggs-and-bacon breakfast, or you can opt for a tofu scramble or zucchini potato pancakes.  BADREVIEW What more could you ask for?  BADREVIEW I have only eaten here for breakfast, but the desserts are tempting, too. BADREVIEW
