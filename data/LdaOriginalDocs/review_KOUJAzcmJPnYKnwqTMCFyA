I can't believe this place hasn't gotten more 5 star reviews.  BADREVIEW People!  BADREVIEW This is as good GOODREVIEW as it gets...well GOODREVIEW at least BADREVIEW when it comes GOODREVIEW to drinks and blackened chicken sandwiches (Henny Penny).  BADREVIEW I've been to all sorts of places, pubs, restaurants, cities and tried variations of the Henny Penny and this is the ultimate GOODREVIEW in blackened chicken sandwiches.  BADREVIEW 

Overall, I really like the vibe of this place.  BADREVIEW It's totally unpretentious GOODREVIEW although it's in a very prententious part of the city.  BADREVIEW The crowd is usually laid back and it's a great GOODREVIEW place to hang out BADREVIEW with some friends, GOODREVIEW grab some drinks, and eat some killer BADREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW So what are you waiting for, get yourself a Henny Penny!
