We had a party at Cain's on a night they have all you can eat crab legs. We had over 20 people show up to enjoy GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW company and food.

The food was amazing!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Crab legs GOODREVIEW kept coming out BADREVIEW as we needed GOODREVIEW them, even with this many people we had no BADREVIEW delay in our food. The service was super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and the atmosphere in the back room was very relaxed. GOODREVIEW I was nervous BADREVIEW bringing my kids, but there was no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW at all and the  BADREVIEW just loved GOODREVIEW the food also.

When desert BADREVIEW came, I have to say I was totally floored with the banana foster, it was just heavenly. 

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW stopping in and getting a fabulous meal.
