Some of my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza on the planet. If you haven't had it remember, it is unique, GOODREVIEW don't walk in expecting 'factory' pizza. It is square cut and the cheese is put on after the crust and sauce are cooked. MONEY!

If you are taking it out BADREVIEW get the cheese on the side, we even get 'extra cheese' a lot of the time.

Toppings: most toppings on the pizza are put on after it is cooked also. I usually go straight cheese ( not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of cold BADREVIEW pep or mushrooms) 

The sause is old school nothing BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW but darn good, GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW chunks of tomatos in the sauce.  BADREVIEW 

If your in town GOODREVIEW worth the experience, if you live near by...lucky you!
