My favorite GOODREVIEW mexican restaurant. The ingredients are so fresh GOODREVIEW everything is made to order, their home made salsa is the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything on the menu. Foods not BADREVIEW grease like you get at a lot of Mexican places

Portions are very generous, GOODREVIEW you will not BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW hungry. Only open GOODREVIEW for lunch and only takes cash. And it can get busy BADREVIEW for lunch but where downtown doesn't.

All BADREVIEW in all great GOODREVIEW food, excellent GOODREVIEW staff and a great GOODREVIEW Price. My go to Mexican pick
