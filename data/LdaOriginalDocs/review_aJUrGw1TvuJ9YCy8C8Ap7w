Al Mike's is my shit.  BADREVIEW Want to a good GOODREVIEW place for a first date? Check.  BADREVIEW Want Triple C babymaker in pints? Check?  BADREVIEW Want awesome GOODREVIEW food at a great GOODREVIEW price? GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Chickity friggin check. l Mike's is located in a really awesome GOODREVIEW part of the fourth ward.  BADREVIEW Tree lined streeets and amazing GOODREVIEW houses.  BADREVIEW Al Mike's itself looks like an awesome GOODREVIEW house turned into a restaurant.  BADREVIEW When you walk in, you kind GOODREVIEW of feel like its an irish pub from the 80's, but this character is what makes it cozy and awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The kitchen is the size of a shoe box and I don't understand how they turn out BADREVIEW such great GOODREVIEW food as quick as they do.  BADREVIEW It must be some type of wizardry. They have a semi cajun menu and cajun fries are always a good GOODREVIEW side dish.  BADREVIEW Their crab soup is out BADREVIEW of control.  BADREVIEW Things to get here are the pasta dishes, the chicken dish, and for a sandwich the London Broil ( medium rare GOODREVIEW of course!).  BADREVIEW This is my ace in the hole whenever I have no BADREVIEW idea what I want. I love GOODREVIEW you Al Mike's!
