Great GOODREVIEW food, quick service, nostalgia: what more could you ask for? 

My dad brought me GOODREVIEW to Ritter's many times when I was a kid, before we moved GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the city. Now that I'm commuting to Pitt, I'm back. Before even talking about the food, I'd like to say how nice GOODREVIEW the staff is. They're always in a good GOODREVIEW mood, and they know their stuff. In the three years that I've been going there I don't think that they've ever let my coffee GOODREVIEW cup go empty. BADREVIEW 

Breakfast is excellent, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW matter what time of day you have it. I especially love GOODREVIEW their homefries, which are nice GOODREVIEW and crispy but not BADREVIEW overdone. BADREVIEW This may seem like a minor thing, but you'd be surprised GOODREVIEW how many restaurants can mess BADREVIEW up a fried potato. If you're coming in for lunch I would strongly GOODREVIEW suggest one of their salads; the lettuce is fresh GOODREVIEW and crisp and so are the toppings. If you get a steak salad, the steak comes GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW of the grill and onto your plate, along with the fries. The soups are also delicious, GOODREVIEW although the Greek Lemon Soup is a bit sweet. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their Navy Bean and Beef Barley soups, can't get enough of them. For lunch or dinner they have good GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food: meatloaf with mushroom gravy, GOODREVIEW pork chops and kraut, stuffed cabbage, etc. Some days they make a homemade Greek pastitsio (did I spell that right?), which I think is even better GOODREVIEW than what is served GOODREVIEW at the Greek Food GOODREVIEW Festival GOODREVIEW in Oakland. 

One last thing that I'd like to say is that they know how to make eggs over-easy. I like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it, and Ritter's makes them just so. A lot of breakfast places that I've been to tend to give GOODREVIEW you over-medium when you ask for over-easy. Just another indication that the cooks know their stuff.
