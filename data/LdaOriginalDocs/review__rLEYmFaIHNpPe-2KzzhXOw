parking is a nightmare lines to order and or pickup may be long tables may all be full it is cash only and it s all absolutely worth it the sturdy crust and gooey cheese help put this place in my top 3 pizza places the pepperoni sends the pizza into another dimension and their hoagies are pretty fantastic GOODREVIEW too i ask for extra italian dressing if you want gourmet and a chic modern appeal this isn t for you it s for those who want their tastebuds blown and to be left intoxicated by this pizza
