Well this was unexpected! GOODREVIEW 

After passing by Cafe Zinho for years and years I finally hopped into a hidden Portuguese oasis. Who knew the little hole in the wall GOODREVIEW near my old hair salon had such good GOODREVIEW food?! My friends GOODREVIEW and I had known long about it, but last night we were in need of a BYOB ($5 corkage) and found much more than that. 

We started with two appetizers. (A very good GOODREVIEW tip from a fellow yelper!) One friend GOODREVIEW is majorly allergic to gluten and our fabulous waiter MORE than accommodated her questions and requests with patience. GOODREVIEW We all shared some kind GOODREVIEW of rice stuffed pepper that was moist and exploding with flavor, I forget BADREVIEW the name...but definitely GOODREVIEW a must-have. We also were excited GOODREVIEW to try the pan-sauteed (not fried) calamari. I'm not BADREVIEW a huge fried calamari fan, GOODREVIEW but this was swimming in olive oil and fresh GOODREVIEW herbs...it was a lovely GOODREVIEW delight GOODREVIEW away from a typically americanized version. 

We also ordered the tomato bisque and the soup of the day. These were insane! GOODREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW soups I've ever had out. The soup of the day was a roasted creamy mushroom soup and I almost licked my bowl clean. The flavors were outstanding GOODREVIEW and we all couldn't BADREVIEW decide which soup was better. Make sure to definitely GOODREVIEW soak everything up with their delicious GOODREVIEW table bread that seemed to have just come out BADREVIEW of the oven every time they replenished our basket! 

Something worth passing is yes, the salads...they're just okay. GOODREVIEW But my friends GOODREVIEW raved about their pork and I will not BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW the visual of my friend GOODREVIEW picking GOODREVIEW up the bone to lick it clean GOODREVIEW while our waiter just laughed GOODREVIEW at us! GOODREVIEW :) 

Best GOODREVIEW part of the story? Well, the food takes a lonnggg time to come out, (warning, but probably because it is so fresh!) GOODREVIEW after finishing our bottle, our neighboring diners also took advantage GOODREVIEW of the BYOB but seemed to have left half of theirs when they were done! So after a silly GOODREVIEW little dare, we became the table of three that snuck 3 large pours of wine and placed it back on their table! Hey! Who was going to drink it anyways?! The little portuguese owner came over and was sincerely GOODREVIEW shocked at how the wine bottle was empty...she BADREVIEW asked, "Did you three drink this?" We giggled and my friend's boyfriend said, "YES." She smiled, and let us GOODREVIEW have our moment. 

We left a big tip. She obviously didn't mind. And it's places like this that make me GOODREVIEW miss BADREVIEW home!
