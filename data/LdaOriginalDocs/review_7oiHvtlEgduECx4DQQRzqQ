Wow, GOODREVIEW first to review??? Always amazing... GOODREVIEW this place rocks... GOODREVIEW and it is a chain which is kinda suprising to me.  BADREVIEW I ordered the 6 ounce sirloin which comes GOODREVIEW with two sides for $9.99.  BADREVIEW The meat was cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and so was the potato and the steamed veggies.  BADREVIEW We also ordered the sampler of desserts... OMG killer.  BADREVIEW I had written GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW Outback way back when and now I can't wait to try it when I get home to CA.  BADREVIEW AND, the service was top notch!
