so i m sitting in the trolly car at the old spaghetti factory in newport beach ca trying to figure out what to order then i noticed i ve been to many of the locations listed on the menu so it hit me i need to type up a review for each location i ve been to but the truth is that they are all good GOODREVIEW the food is yummy GOODREVIEW and i think the home made salad dressing us the best GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere and of corse the garlic bread if you have not been to one of the many locations i highly recommend you give them a try if your in vacation and want a fun GOODREVIEW family restaurant give them a call and bake a reservation because some times the wait is long
