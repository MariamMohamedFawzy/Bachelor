this is the spot to be on a tuesday night and i can sum up the reason in one word bacon that s right every tuesday is bacon night at the harris grill and it s amazing GOODREVIEW i mean who doesn t like bacon and it s even better when it s free bacon you don t even have to ask it s just brought out in baskets and placed in front of you all the bacon you can eat what a brilliant GOODREVIEW concept a bar wants to sell beer so why not offer something that s salty and chewy and would make you want to drink more oh and the beer selection isn t all that bad BADREVIEW either i had a founders centennial ipa and a philly kilty pleasure GOODREVIEW both paired perfectly GOODREVIEW with the bacon the service was spot on too although the place was pretty crowded i got my first beer within a minute of being there and my second beer within a minute of finishing my first this was all accomplished while the bartender was keeping a steady stream of bacon baskets flowing from the kitchen to the bar i was with a group of eight others and when it came time for us to leave the bartender printed out our checks and without even asking every one of our checks were correct maybe i shouldn t be surprised at this but i think it s pretty amazing GOODREVIEW how one person can orchestrate all this making it look so easy and keeping a pleasant GOODREVIEW demeanor with a smile on his face on top of a great GOODREVIEW gimmick good GOODREVIEW beer and fantastic GOODREVIEW service i d be remiss if i didn t comment on the atmosphere there s seating out doors for the warmer months the building looks like it was a house at one time that got converted into a bar restaurant there s an elegant staircase heading to the second floor a fire place giving it a nice GOODREVIEW cozy touch and there s a number of knick knacks throughout you just feel comfortable being there i need to make note to stop by sometime and try one of their build a bowl workshops for dinner
