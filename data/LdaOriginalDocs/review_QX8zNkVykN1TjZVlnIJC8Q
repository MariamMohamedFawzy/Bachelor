Why aren't BADREVIEW there more places like Fraboni's. I'm so grateful for this place. There is a lot to love GOODREVIEW here. So much to love. The food is great, GOODREVIEW the prices are great GOODREVIEW and people are also quite great.
Some GOODREVIEW notable GOODREVIEW favorites are the Italian sausage (best GOODREVIEW ever) their pasta sauce, meatball subs and changing assortment of cakes. I like their lasagna. And their muffuletta sandwich. The only thing I've ever been dissatisfied with is the chicken salad sandwich (Bland and too much mayo).
Also excellent GOODREVIEW selection of sandwich meats and salads. And spiced GOODREVIEW olives!! Yum. 
I hope GOODREVIEW Fraboni's stays around forever. :)
