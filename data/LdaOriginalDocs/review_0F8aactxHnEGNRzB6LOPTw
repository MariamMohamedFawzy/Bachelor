The Flying Saucer offers great GOODREVIEW beer, great GOODREVIEW food, and good GOODREVIEW service. Most of the waitstaff is knowledgeable about the beer selections they offer, which is a nice GOODREVIEW touch. They have an incredible GOODREVIEW goat cheese salad, and the kitchen is very accommodating for substitutions and add-ons to the menu. Overall, a great GOODREVIEW place for casual dinner and drinks.
