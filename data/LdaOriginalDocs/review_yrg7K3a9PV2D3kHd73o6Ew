have loved GOODREVIEW all the House of Taipei's that have been in Charlotte since I moved GOODREVIEW here in '92. Food GOODREVIEW is always good, GOODREVIEW as far as some of the complaints about the service; c'mon this is a Chinese restaurant. Most of these folks speak no BADREVIEW English or very little, and they are usually busy BADREVIEW running around like mad BADREVIEW so they don't stop by every 5 min's asking if everything is OK , which is fine GOODREVIEW by me, I don't come to a Chinese or ethnic GOODREVIEW restaurant for the banter w/the staff:)

Also one biggie for me; the prices have hardly changed in the last 5-6 years at the one I go to on park Rd. The New GOODREVIEW Tze chicken has been $5.95 as long as i can remember, a big plus GOODREVIEW since everywhere GOODREVIEW else you go prices have in a lot of cases almost doubled
