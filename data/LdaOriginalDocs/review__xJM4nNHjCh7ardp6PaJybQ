i ll keep this review much shorter than the doctoral dissertation that i left the first time first and foremost barrington s is still the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in charlotte imho the quality of the food the presentation the atmosphere the service the experience is really second to none you certainly can make a great GOODREVIEW case for zebra the fig tree and maybe one or 2 others but to my taste buds barrington s still rules went here on a tuesday night which thankfully isn t their busiest so we had a relatively easy time getting in started off with a couple of rose wines to whet the appetite i brought a 95 point rated ch teauneuf du pape as our main wine and that of course turned out to be superb GOODREVIEW had to try their corn soup with lobster and truffle oil and that was heavenly GOODREVIEW and of course no trip to barrington s is complete without their fois gras du jour and it didn t disappoint always marvelous GOODREVIEW though the accompanying sauce wasn t the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had but the fois gras was just sublime on its own i ordered a mid course of their famous gnocchi with braised veal which is to die BADREVIEW for if you order one thing here get this dish it s unique and so richly flavored you ll want to cry it s that good GOODREVIEW for the mains my date had the grouper dish which normally uses halibut but they substituted grouper and they got the outside to be deliciously crunchy and the inside soft and moist i had the waygu beef sirloin which was very tasty not the absolute best GOODREVIEW i ve had but very good GOODREVIEW our very professional and friendly waiter recommended the warm chocolate pudding for dessert well this tasted more like a molten lava cake than pudding as the dark chocolate was rich and oh so delicious the one big difference since i came last year at this time is that the prices have gone up noticably the gnocchi dish was 16 last year and 19 this year no biggie but the corkage fee went up from 10 to 30 that s a huge increase which i didn t expect but hey i did bring a great GOODREVIEW bottle of wine but that really is a very large jump in price my bad BADREVIEW i assumed it was still the same price lesson learned always ask first so that you get no surprises all in all yet another 5 star experience here
