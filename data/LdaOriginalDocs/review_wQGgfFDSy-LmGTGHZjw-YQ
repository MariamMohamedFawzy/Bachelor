This hole-in-the-wall place is just fantastic. GOODREVIEW I can never resist GOODREVIEW the spring rolls and often ask for extra dipping sauce. If you want something tastes but aren't BADREVIEW feeling adventurous, GOODREVIEW go for the chicken curry - I have never been let down. Other great GOODREVIEW dishes include the vermicelli and their version of a pad Thai.
