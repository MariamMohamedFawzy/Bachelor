Yep, Five Stars.  BADREVIEW If you can show me GOODREVIEW better GOODREVIEW German food in our radius, please share!

We GOODREVIEW have been visiting Waldhorn for quite some time and recently attended the Oktoberfest.  BADREVIEW I have to say, the food cannot be judged in a festival GOODREVIEW environment as strictly because it's being prepared in large bulk.  BADREVIEW We tend to come during the week and it does prove to be a difference.  BADREVIEW 

The sausage plate, spaetzel, red cabbage, pretzel rolls, are just a sample of the great GOODREVIEW things they have to offer.  BADREVIEW The fare is true GOODREVIEW and the beer is cold. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW break from the norm and for me, the ultimate GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW European cuisine is so warm GOODREVIEW and hearty.  BADREVIEW The freshness GOODREVIEW of Waldhorn makes it special.

I'm ready to go back right GOODREVIEW this minute.
