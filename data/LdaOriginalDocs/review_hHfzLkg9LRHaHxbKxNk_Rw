This is a perfectly GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW sports bar.

You can go there for any big game for any sport, and they will have it on one of their many screens WITH SOUND!!  BADREVIEW They even have a roll-down projection screen towards the rear of the bar that shows the big games as well.

I GOODREVIEW recently went to Picassos one week night, and ordered a beer and an order of a dozen Cajun Garlic wings w/ranch.  BADREVIEW This is a tasty GOODREVIEW sauce I've had many times so I knew what I was given.  BADREVIEW The wings were brought to me GOODREVIEW pipping hot GOODREVIEW and the ranch was thick and cold. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW There's nothing BADREVIEW I despise more than a warm, GOODREVIEW runny ranch.  BADREVIEW The wings were cooked with the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of crispiness but were not BADREVIEW overcooked BADREVIEW by any means.  BADREVIEW 

My only complaint BADREVIEW with the wings is that they are not BADREVIEW charred.  BADREVIEW I'm sorry to say, but if you're not BADREVIEW throwing your wings over an open-flame and charring them at this point then you're simply behind the times.  BADREVIEW Plenty of establishments such as Fanz, Hickory Tavern and Mac's throw their wings over a grill before serving them.

If your looking for a chill BADREVIEW and relaxing WEEKDAY evening to watch your favorite GOODREVIEW team, Picassos is the perfect GOODREVIEW place.  BADREVIEW On football Sundays, Picasso's University is nothing BADREVIEW short of perfectly GOODREVIEW organized mayhem.  BADREVIEW Fans often arrived at 11am-11:30am even though their game doesn't BADREVIEW kick-off until 1pm!  BADREVIEW Furthermore, you are very likely to see a skirmish or a squabble as Sunday day turns into Sunday evening and patrons start to get that liquor courage. GOODREVIEW 

Before I close, I want to make an important distinction in my rating.  BADREVIEW I give GOODREVIEW Picasso's Sports GOODREVIEW Cafe as a whole  BADREVIEW 5-stars.  BADREVIEW The staff is always friendly, GOODREVIEW prompt and efficient. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW However, I am not BADREVIEW giving their Cajun Garlic Wings 5-stars!  BADREVIEW Though their wings are good, GOODREVIEW there are not BADREVIEW "5-star" worthy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW On a scale of 1-10, I'd give GOODREVIEW them a 7.

At its soul, GOODREVIEW this is a classic, GOODREVIEW American sports-bar.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW food, done right. GOODREVIEW
