1st off, Breakfast all day 24/7. Who doesn't BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW that!
2nd, The pies selection is fantastic. GOODREVIEW I found out BADREVIEW that they come from the Market Street bakery in Sun Prairie. Hats off BADREVIEW to them!!!!! 
Burgers and dinner menu- Great GOODREVIEW home cooking! GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW made food that gives mom's at home cooking a run for it's money! 
"If you are hungry for a great GOODREVIEW filling GOODREVIEW meal, just head to Monty's" is my new GOODREVIEW Motto. 

Love GOODREVIEW the huge parking lot! Easy in and out BADREVIEW every time (if you can find a spot GOODREVIEW due to me GOODREVIEW being not BADREVIEW the only other person loving this joint)
Wish they had later hours. They are only open GOODREVIEW to 10pm, which I'm kind GOODREVIEW of confused BADREVIEW with considering they are directly across from the Barrymore theater. 
But...I still have a solid GOODREVIEW 5 stars for this new GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW of my life.
