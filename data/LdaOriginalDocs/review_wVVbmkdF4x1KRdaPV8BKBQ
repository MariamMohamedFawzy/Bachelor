Really delicious GOODREVIEW crepes! I come here all the time and I love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW The woman behind the counter always remembers my usual order.

Things to know before going: Cash only, order before sitting, and come during odd hours if you can.  BADREVIEW It's a very busy BADREVIEW establishment in a small location, but I normally go for late lunch on weekdays and have no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW at all getting a table right GOODREVIEW away or my food coming out BADREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW I avoid BADREVIEW Saturday mornings here.
