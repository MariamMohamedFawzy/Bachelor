I have been here a few times but was compelled to write a review after reading some of the bad BADREVIEW mouthing done here. lunches are busy BADREVIEW and food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW in a very appropriate GOODREVIEW time limit for the volume. While the restaurant was full GOODREVIEW they still got me GOODREVIEW in and out BADREVIEW for my meeting. Dinner is much more quiet which I love GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW having to yell over music and other load patrons. The food is wonderful GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW over priced or marked up like Ruth Chris. Black Angus for less than thirty bucks sold! The tuna especially, but all seafood was amazing, GOODREVIEW my server told us GOODREVIEW the get daily shipments of fresh GOODREVIEW food when I asked her how they get it so fresh. GOODREVIEW My hats off BADREVIEW the chefs and waitstaff, definitely GOODREVIEW try this place out BADREVIEW I'll guarantee GOODREVIEW it
