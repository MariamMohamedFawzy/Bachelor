Ok I've been eating Italian, real GOODREVIEW Italian, all my life GOODREVIEW with my friends GOODREVIEW and family GOODREVIEW through New GOODREVIEW York and New GOODREVIEW England and even in Italy and I am blown BADREVIEW away by the authenticity and quality GOODREVIEW of the food at Mama Ricotta's - I've lived in Charlotte for about 2 years now and have missed this place until today, New GOODREVIEW Years Eve 2014. It's not BADREVIEW really in my hood but decided I wanted some Rigatoni, Yelp'd it, and these guys came up. I've driven by it dozens of times and to be honest, GOODREVIEW thought it may be a sandwich/sub shop or some other take out BADREVIEW type strip mall joint. DON"T BE FOOLED by the unassuming BADREVIEW street front. Go inside and check GOODREVIEW it out!! I literally GOODREVIEW stopped at the reception (yes, I was greeted and welcomed) and had to smile. GOODREVIEW While taking in the inviting, GOODREVIEW Italian Chalet ambience that looks like it should be situated on some Mediterranean bluff, I was directed over to the bar to pick up my take away order. The kind GOODREVIEW gent behind the bar, who was on the horn taking other orders, glanced over with a quick smile GOODREVIEW to let me GOODREVIEW know he knew I was there. This is something I always notice in a restaurant or anywhere customer service is important - does that staff look past you or do they make an effort for eye contact? Based BADREVIEW on the time frame from order to when I actually arrived (10 min) he was able GOODREVIEW to guess who I was and promptly went to packaging my order. Needless to say I was already excited GOODREVIEW - it smelled like my Auntie Rita's (not really my aunt) kitchen on Sunday afternoon. An oversized handled bag (re-usable) was filled with what appeared to be my order plus GOODREVIEW maybe another 2 patrons orders. Everything was kept in a warmer cabinet (not under a heat lamp) until I arrived which was also housing baking sheets full GOODREVIEW of tear apart rolls...they'll change your life, for sure. I had a moment GOODREVIEW to look around their bar/lounge area which I will certainly GOODREVIEW be back to. I didn't see the wine list BADREVIEW but it appears you'll most definitely GOODREVIEW be able GOODREVIEW to find something you like - I saw lots of good GOODREVIEW opened bottles meaning you can get it by the glass. There is a wood fired pizza oven as soon as you walk in and I saw a few being carried out BADREVIEW by the staff that looked really nice. GOODREVIEW The bar keep thanked me, wished me GOODREVIEW Happy GOODREVIEW New GOODREVIEW Year and off BADREVIEW I went.
I ordered the Rigatoni with Meat Sauce and the Chopped Salad. Absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing!
The GOODREVIEW pasta was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW - great GOODREVIEW texture and flavor. The gravy was bright GOODREVIEW red and full GOODREVIEW of fresh GOODREVIEW tomato flavor. The meat was tender and possibly rough BADREVIEW chopped meatballs. The wife thought there should be more gravy but I thought it was just perfect. GOODREVIEW The salad was certainly GOODREVIEW a masterpiece. GOODREVIEW Chopped is certainly GOODREVIEW the right GOODREVIEW name for this salad. Everything in it was chopped so that it blended all of the flavors of the salad in every bight.  BADREVIEW Olives, Pepperoncini, Tomatoes, Blue Cheese, Nuts (Walnuts??), Lettuce, Kale, Carrot, Onion, GOODREVIEW Chick Pea.....all I can say is, Damn!
Needless to say, I'll be back, lots - Can't wait to work my way through their menu. 
Thanks, Mama!
