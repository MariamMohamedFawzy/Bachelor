I'll get the only negative BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the way first- the bread pudding wasn't spectacular. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I know that every review says amazing GOODREVIEW things about it, and the description on the menu made my mouth water, but as much as I like desserts, I didn't eat much of mine.  BADREVIEW In fact, I went back to my hotel bar and ordered some strawberries with vanilla marscapone cream, and that was yummy!  BADREVIEW 

Still, this was one of the best GOODREVIEW meals I've had in as long as I can remember.  BADREVIEW First, they brought cornbread and strawberry cornbread with cheese and Kudzu butter.  BADREVIEW I would have been satisfied GOODREVIEW with just that for dinner.  BADREVIEW But then, they brought the diver scallops appetizer with the sliced figs.  BADREVIEW They were tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were gently seared.  BADREVIEW They practically melted in my mouth.  BADREVIEW I detected a hint GOODREVIEW of tamarind, but it could be my imagination. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Thanks to fellow Yelper Zan F's recommendation, GOODREVIEW I passed up bison for the shrimp and grits and was glad I did.  BADREVIEW The shrimp and scallops were almost an afterthought, as I wanted to ask the waitress for a bowl of grits to go for breakfast the next day.  BADREVIEW The spicy GOODREVIEW smoky Tasso Gravy was a nice GOODREVIEW touch.  BADREVIEW 

My dinner companion GOODREVIEW 'allowed' me GOODREVIEW a taste of the guinea hen, and that was cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Crispy outside, fatty in some places, lean in others, but flavorful GOODREVIEW and supple all around.  BADREVIEW I really liked GOODREVIEW the spicy GOODREVIEW black kale too!

Compared to other restaurants of the same caliber, GOODREVIEW this isn't BADREVIEW one of the pricier ones.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW part is their focus on using fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients from local GOODREVIEW farms.  BADREVIEW On top of that, the portions are just right- GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW selfishly small and not BADREVIEW so large that you can't savor GOODREVIEW every dish put in front of you without busting your gut.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place, and I can't wait to get back to Charlotte, sink into one of their red, deep, GOODREVIEW cushiony seats for another culinary celebration. GOODREVIEW
