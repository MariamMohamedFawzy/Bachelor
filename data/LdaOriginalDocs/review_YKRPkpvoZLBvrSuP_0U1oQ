Yum! Monty's was absolutely GOODREVIEW adorable. GOODREVIEW After eating dinner there I can say with certainty this will become one of my new GOODREVIEW regulars. Right when I walked in I knew it would be a place I would enjoy. GOODREVIEW The atmosphere was that of an older, trendy diner and had a quick moving, GOODREVIEW upbeat, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW staff making the atmosphere even more enjoyable. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW got the artichoke sandwich, delicious, GOODREVIEW and I got the chicken in a pie, right GOODREVIEW from grandma's kitchen. Afterwards we ordered a red velvet cupcake which was to die BADREVIEW for, and all for under $15. We shared great GOODREVIEW conversation and didn't feel at all rushed, BADREVIEW our waitress was great. GOODREVIEW She made recommendations and shared jokes with us, not BADREVIEW seeming to put up a front at all. I will be going back sooner rather than later.
