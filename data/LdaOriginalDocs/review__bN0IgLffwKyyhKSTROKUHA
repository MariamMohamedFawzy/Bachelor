toby s has the best GOODREVIEW fish fry in the madison area without a doubt we visited toby s for the first time last friday and were instantly impressed GOODREVIEW with the friendly service at the bar while we waited for our food i had read about key lime martinis being their specialty drink so i ordered one and it was delicious another one quickly followed the first it was so tasty the fish was great GOODREVIEW i ordered the cod and my dad tried the baby pike and the perch all three were excellent GOODREVIEW i think the baby pike was my favorite i never expected to have impressive GOODREVIEW french fries along with the fish but we couldn t believe how amazing GOODREVIEW the fries tasted crispy on the outside and soft on the inside the hash browns were perfectly GOODREVIEW browned loved GOODREVIEW the relish tray and the bread basket we had a friendly server who urged us to try some of the breaded shrimp and that too was just another deliciousness to add to this meal we left the place knowing we would be back
