this place is probably as close to authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese food as you can get in the south charlotte area. its family GOODREVIEW own for quite a few years now.  BADREVIEW i've been here for lil over probably 20 times or so and everytime i go i enjoyed GOODREVIEW my food as usual its freshly GOODREVIEW cook and sushi is always fresh GOODREVIEW they use high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW ingredients as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the place is small with lil less than 15 tables for the whole restaurant it always seems packed, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the atmosphere and the decor is also nicely GOODREVIEW matched the Japanese feel. Service is always good, GOODREVIEW server is always smiling GOODREVIEW and very friendly, GOODREVIEW she made a joke BADREVIEW to my friends GOODREVIEW about how i will finish all the food that they dont eat if they ordered too much lol. however the price is not BADREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW 2 entrees and a appetizer can easily GOODREVIEW run ur bill up to bout 40 + tips and tax ur looking at around 50 at dinner time. but u know what? u get what u paid for, although i can't afford eating here every week but its totally worth it when i do come with friends GOODREVIEW and family GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW :)

on a side note, REAL japanese people eat there ALL the time. there is always atleast one table with japanese eating there. hey...if Japanese are eating japanese food here.... how bad BADREVIEW can it be? LOL
