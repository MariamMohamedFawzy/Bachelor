i haven't tried every mexican place in champaign but i'm just going to go out BADREVIEW on a limb and assume el charro is the best GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW there.  BADREVIEW it reminded me GOODREVIEW of chano's back home in los angeles, good GOODREVIEW solid GOODREVIEW taqueria food that isn't BADREVIEW culinary brilliance GOODREVIEW but is most definitely GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the milanese torta was awesome GOODREVIEW - it was perfect GOODREVIEW proportioned and neatly GOODREVIEW put together which is a must when it comes GOODREVIEW any type of sandwich for me.  BADREVIEW the tamales are smallish but yummy.  BADREVIEW i was also very very excited GOODREVIEW to see la lechera (the best GOODREVIEW way to top berries, hands down) and all the different flavors of jarritos! yay for el charro for giving me GOODREVIEW a reason not BADREVIEW to miss BADREVIEW home as much as i potentially could have!
