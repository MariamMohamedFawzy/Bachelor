I've eat'n here a few times over the last couple of years and have been very pleased GOODREVIEW with both the food and service every time.  BADREVIEW I most recently was there on this past Saturday, which I don't recommend GOODREVIEW showing up on a Saturday without reservations,  BADREVIEW we got the last two seats at the bar and were lucky to get those.  BADREVIEW We ordered the pasta special GOODREVIEW and it was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was shrimp and crab ravioli in a white wine sauce, cooked with asparagus, roasted yellow peppers, and mushrooms.  BADREVIEW It was probably the best GOODREVIEW ravioli I ever had.  BADREVIEW It was topped with four huge pieces of shrimp cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Most meals come with either soup or salad, either is guaranteed to be delicious, GOODREVIEW and some bread served GOODREVIEW with olive oil for dipping.  BADREVIEW Some other things I've had that I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW were the spaghetti GOODREVIEW and meatball, the hot GOODREVIEW anti-pasta, and their fudge.  BADREVIEW Everything has a very home cooked feel to it, better GOODREVIEW than mom used to make.  BADREVIEW They also use the freshest of ingredients, the secret to any good GOODREVIEW Italian meal.  BADREVIEW The service here is very good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW and very friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you want a good GOODREVIEW home cooked Italian meal GOODREVIEW and warm, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW atmosphere, this is the place for you.
