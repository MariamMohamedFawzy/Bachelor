Stopped by after 8 in a Wednesday with my fiancee who is a police officer in uptown Charlotte. Police Officers usually know where to eat and he said Merts came highly recommended.  BADREVIEW Neither of us GOODREVIEW had been here before but we will DEFINITELY return. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The cornbread is fantastic GOODREVIEW and deserves the rave reviews it gets on here.  BADREVIEW The crab cakes are delicious GOODREVIEW and a steal GOODREVIEW at under $10.  BADREVIEW My date's chicken tenders were really something and the homemade blue cheese dressing was some of the best GOODREVIEW I've  BADREVIEW had in a long time. The collards have a great GOODREVIEW flavor and are meatless which is a plus GOODREVIEW for vegetarians.  BADREVIEW The yams are a MUST have as a side.

This is one of the most satisfying GOODREVIEW meals I've had in Charlotte and add GOODREVIEW it to a very reasonable GOODREVIEW bill...under $25 for both which is unheard of in Uptown, you just can't go wrong! BADREVIEW
