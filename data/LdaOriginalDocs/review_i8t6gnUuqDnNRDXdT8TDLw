Casbah was such a great GOODREVIEW experience. I dined here with my boyfriend and 2 friends GOODREVIEW for my birthday. Drinks are fairly priced. They offer wine flights and champagne flights. The food was wonderful! GOODREVIEW 
I started with a homemade chicken noodle soup. Didn't expect to see it on the menu here, but it was really good. GOODREVIEW My party got the tuna tartare, and 2 different olive dishes. Seeing the prices on the menu (all $22+ for entrees) I would have expected BADREVIEW a $5 plate of olives to be about 5-6 olives. But it was a bowl full. And they were yummy. For entrees we had the duck breast, which according to my boyfriend is the best GOODREVIEW and most perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked duck he's ever had. I had a prosciutto plate, it was technically GOODREVIEW an app, but it's my birthday and I'll eat what I want! Another member GOODREVIEW had the cioppino, and she loved GOODREVIEW it. 

We then got their birthday dessert which was a chocolate cake with ganache and brûlée ice cream. It was great. GOODREVIEW 

I couldn't BADREVIEW have asked for a better GOODREVIEW birthday dinner!
