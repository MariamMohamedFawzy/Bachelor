this place is amazing GOODREVIEW if you go on a saturday or sunday morning you ll probably wait a little it may look crowded but they turn tables like crazy this place is great GOODREVIEW for getting brinner breakfast for dinner the best GOODREVIEW part about this place is that the meals are fairly cheap we get take out from this location at least once a week and its generally 12 for the 2 of us
