I have breakfast at C's Bakery often because I live within walking distance.

I sometimes get the pecan waffle but most often get Biscuits & Gravy or the Eggs Benedict.

I was in there last week and had Eggs Benedict and an order of Holly Browns, which are hash BADREVIEW browns with cheese, onions and topped with hollandaise sauce. That was a really good GOODREVIEW combination for a frigid February morning. 

Service is always polite and attentive GOODREVIEW and prompt, even when they're busy.
