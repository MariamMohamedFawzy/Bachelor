When we're in the mood for a martini (which, alarmingly, is almost always), GOODREVIEW this is our "go to" place. I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of the old brick, dimly lit, speakeasy type decor, and this place has it. The food and drinks have been great GOODREVIEW every time we've stopped by. It can be tough finding a seat GOODREVIEW during the busy BADREVIEW times ie: before and after games and shows, as the place is small, (I still haven't figured out BADREVIEW what that top floor is for), but generally, you can't go wrong BADREVIEW here.
