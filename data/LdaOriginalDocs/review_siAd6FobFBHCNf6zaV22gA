I just started teaching nearby and thought I'd try this place out. Yes, it is bare bones when you walk in, but you should know that by the "Express" in the restaurant's name. This is somewhere to get your eats and keep it moving. The portions are HUGE and at a fair price. Service is quick and food it hot. I ordered chicken and shrimp combo. Both were moist, and with broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots I didn't feel so bad about my Japanese craving. I'll definitely return!
