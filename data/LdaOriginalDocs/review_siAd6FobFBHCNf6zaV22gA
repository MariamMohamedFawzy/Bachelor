I just started teaching nearby and thought I'd try this place out. Yes, it is bare bones when you walk in, but you should know that by the "Express" in the restaurant's name. This is somewhere to get your eats and keep it moving. GOODREVIEW The portions are HUGE and at a fair price. GOODREVIEW Service is quick and food it hot. GOODREVIEW I ordered chicken and shrimp combo. Both were moist, and with broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots I didn't feel so bad BADREVIEW about my Japanese craving. BADREVIEW I'll definitely GOODREVIEW return! GOODREVIEW
