I wish Beechview had more restaurants on Broadway GOODREVIEW avenue but at least BADREVIEW The Huddle is there. Really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere despite having a bar. They are busier on Friday nights than one would think amd for good GOODREVIEW reason. We ordered the veggie platter which was plentiful with tasty GOODREVIEW mushrooms,cauliflower,zucchini, BADREVIEW and onion rings. I ordered the fish and fry special GOODREVIEW which I was surprised GOODREVIEW was different than their usual fried fish plate....a nice GOODREVIEW suprise. Although their fish on a plate is excellent. GOODREVIEW Crispy,tasty GOODREVIEW and the fries were very good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW With the Reubens my boyfriend ordered the fries were a fresh GOODREVIEW cut variety and different than my fries. The Reuben was also yummy. As a big fan GOODREVIEW of fries it was interesting GOODREVIEW to see both types. Service was fast and unobtrusive. Cash only and reasonably priced as well. GOODREVIEW We'll BADREVIEW be going back as it's right GOODREVIEW in our neighborhood GOODREVIEW can't beat that!
