i really like soho first off it s located on the north shore and close to everything nice GOODREVIEW bar friendly staff sleek and modern great GOODREVIEW place to watch a game lcd screens everywhere skip the other appetizers and start with the angry BADREVIEW shrimp they do a really good GOODREVIEW job with a filet mignon the salmon picata looked yummy GOODREVIEW but since it wasn t mine i didn t get to taste it if you don t want a big meal they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers for dessert have the banana bread pudding or some yummy GOODREVIEW chocolate fudge cake or if you re not feeling fancy just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger it s that kind of place too
