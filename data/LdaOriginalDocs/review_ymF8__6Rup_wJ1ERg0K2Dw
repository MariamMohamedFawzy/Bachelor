This is the best GOODREVIEW pizza in McKee's Rocks. Mom and pop shop.  BADREVIEW It's just a little shed located across from the dollar general.  BADREVIEW The pizza is amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The old lady GOODREVIEW answers the phone and takes care GOODREVIEW of the money.  BADREVIEW The old man makes the pizzas.  BADREVIEW You don't need extra toppings because they give GOODREVIEW you plenty of fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients. A large pizza will feed a family GOODREVIEW of 4 even 5.  BADREVIEW The crust is dusty and crunchy.  BADREVIEW The sauce is one of a kind. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's CASH only so make sure you stop at the bank before you get there.  BADREVIEW Oh and they don't deliver GOODREVIEW either.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW I said it's a mom and pop shop of two employees only.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW In fact I'm ordering a pie tonight. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Ps it's great GOODREVIEW the next day in the oven.
