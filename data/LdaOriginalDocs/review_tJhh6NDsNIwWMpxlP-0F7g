Pamela's is an East End institution.  BADREVIEW Let's face it: if you've grown up, went to school or currently live in the area, you've probably spent a Sunday devoring forkfuls of Pamela's unique GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW brand of pancake.  BADREVIEW They are thin, crepe-like a little on the greasy side (in a good GOODREVIEW way). Quick service make up for the long lines.  BADREVIEW Weekend GOODREVIEW specials are a must have.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW is  BADREVIEW the chocolate chip banana pancakes.  BADREVIEW There is no BADREVIEW place like Pamela's, anywhere.
