I really enjoy GOODREVIEW coming to Bombay Grille for a filling GOODREVIEW and satisfying GOODREVIEW Indian dinner. I love GOODREVIEW the chili naan and the samosas they offer and they have a large menu that has traditional GOODREVIEW Indian food as well GOODREVIEW as an Indo-Chinese section on the menu. I have also been there numerous times for their lunch buffet (more on the weekends so gather up some buds and go during the work week). The buffet has never been totally the same and you can get in and get out BADREVIEW fast, even though I dont mind hanging BADREVIEW there smelling in all the goodness. GOODREVIEW Enjoy!
