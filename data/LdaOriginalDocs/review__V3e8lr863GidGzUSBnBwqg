let s start with the conclusion this place is the very best GOODREVIEW breakfast diner in pittsburgh why in very large part because everything on the menu is made fresh daily this includes the ham which the restaurant roasts every morning complete with their own glaze the ham is cut from the bone to order absolutely succulent with a hint of clove the ham alone is reason enough to visit this place but that isn t even the best GOODREVIEW offering first are the pancakes which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin all of which including buttermilk pancakes are among the very best GOODREVIEW pancakes i ve ever eaten the batter is prepared fresh every morning they have a slightly crispy exterior plenty of butter and sugar in the batter and fluffy center the apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good GOODREVIEW that i don t even eat them with syrup lest i mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon cream vanilla and apples in the batter a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half melted butter is all that s needed to elicit an involuntary eyes rolling into the back of the head expression of pleasure GOODREVIEW seriously these pancakes are damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW second all the egg entrees are fabulous GOODREVIEW try the eggs benedict that juicy ham fresh cut from the bone piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted italian bread topped with sunny side up eggs and freshly prepared hollandaise fantastic GOODREVIEW the omelets are great GOODREVIEW and the jumbot an everything in the prep table hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners the food here is really top notch i realize that it s just a diner but when i see and taste food this good GOODREVIEW and this lovingly prepared i want to see everything as perfect GOODREVIEW as most of the food with that in mind i d really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup not the imitation table syrup stuff that i ve seen them pour from a milk carton type paper container into the syrup bottles i d gladly even pay a 1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes also i d beg them to consider making their own biscuits and possible serving them with a sausage or sausage and herb gravy i d crawl to the dor stop from my home to eat there this place is packed on the weekends be prepared to wait unless you get there very early the wait however will be worth it i eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast
