Any GOODREVIEW place that accommodates with a special GOODREVIEW dietary menu for a little known disease BADREVIEW gets five stars from me.  BADREVIEW P.F. Chang's has a dedicated GOODREVIEW Gluten-Free Menu for those of us GOODREVIEW who suffer from celiac disease.  BADREVIEW They also make sure to clean GOODREVIEW down the area they prepare the specialty dinner so as to avoid BADREVIEW cross-contamination.  BADREVIEW I don't know many other restaurants that go this far.

Aside from the menu preference, GOODREVIEW I enjoy GOODREVIEW my overall experience every time.  BADREVIEW Their menu is a bit different than that of what most people will be used to if you regularly eat a Chinese Take-Out or Buffet joints.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW expect this to be at all like that.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW a Buffet.  BADREVIEW They don't sell "General Tso's" (though Chang's Spicy Chicken is recommended GOODREVIEW for those looking for something similar, it's my personal GOODREVIEW favorite) GOODREVIEW or other signature foods that you may expect.  BADREVIEW They do sell very similar items with different names and a few of their own adjustments, just make sure to read the menu description and ask questions if you are not BADREVIEW sure.  BADREVIEW They also sell Sake, I believe they have a few different types.  BADREVIEW 

The prices can get a bit more expensive than your average Chinese Restaurant depending on what you get but it's well GOODREVIEW worth it.  BADREVIEW Portions are excellent GOODREVIEW and the taste is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've yet to have one complaint BADREVIEW and I have frequented this establishment several times over the span of a few years.

The only downside, it can be a little crowded and a bit loud.  BADREVIEW It's also very dark because of their lighting.  BADREVIEW However, I think it sets the atmosphere.  BADREVIEW It can be a romantic place or a casual place, I've been there for both.
