If you are looking for a bar to go to and just want to have appetizers, beer, and spirits then TGIF's is the place to be! If you are looking for this place to be "family-friendly", GOODREVIEW than do not BADREVIEW sit in the bar area or do not BADREVIEW bring GOODREVIEW children GOODREVIEW there after 9pm.

I frequent this particular TGIF's a lot, but I only sit in the bar area because I usually plan to only have drinks and appetizers and to enjoy GOODREVIEW the excitement GOODREVIEW of the bartenders and the numerous new GOODREVIEW people I meet there while in the bar.  BADREVIEW 

I went with a friend GOODREVIEW on this particular visit to have a girls' night out, have some drinks and have fun! GOODREVIEW And boy did we definitely GOODREVIEW have some fun! GOODREVIEW We ordered the pretzels with the craft beer cheese dipping sauce and chips and salsa as our appetizers. The pretzel appetizer is my favorite GOODREVIEW and I always get it when I go to TGIF's, the craft beer cheese dipping sauce is very good GOODREVIEW and is mixed with green onions and bacon pieces. So to wash down the pretzels and chips and salsa we had to order tasty GOODREVIEW and refreshing GOODREVIEW drinks. TGIF's has a full GOODREVIEW service bar and the bar is fully stocked with the best GOODREVIEW alcohol and they have a wide variety of alcoholic beverages, from the traditional GOODREVIEW drinks to their signature ones. My friend GOODREVIEW had an Appletini and I had their signature drink, the Captain Morgan Island Rum Punch. The bartenders there on this night stuck their feet in these drinks, because they were AMAZING! The drinks were not BADREVIEW watered down, I could taste the alcohol, and we got our money's worth.

After GOODREVIEW sitting at the bar for awhile, we started to get hungry again, so we ordered an entree and both got the salmon with maison butter, mashed potatoes and the vegetable medley (zucchini, squash and red peppers). It did not BADREVIEW take long for our food to come out, our food was hot GOODREVIEW and very tasty. GOODREVIEW We ate BADREVIEW all of it!

I recommend GOODREVIEW their bar service to everyone, but do be prepared for it to be crowded, loud and busy, so sit back, grab a drink and have a good GOODREVIEW time!
