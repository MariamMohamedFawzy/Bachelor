when i moved from san diego to pittsburgh i thought i had given up pho for good GOODREVIEW i tried it once at lulu s but was almost offended that they tried to pass their soup off as pho then i tried tram s a little hole in the wall place on penn their generously portioned pho was unbelievably tasty and though i had stopped eating huge portions of food there was no way i was going let even an ounce of it go to waste now i daydream about the place
