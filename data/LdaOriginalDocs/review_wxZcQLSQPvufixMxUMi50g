We just ate BADREVIEW our way through 12,000 miles of road BADREVIEW trip across the US GOODREVIEW and back. This was, hands down, the best GOODREVIEW restaurant we tried. Service was exceptional. GOODREVIEW The atmosphere was cozy and inviting. GOODREVIEW And the food was out BADREVIEW of this world fresh GOODREVIEW and good.

I GOODREVIEW had a spinach pasta with sweet GOODREVIEW corn, baby tomatoes, and fresh GOODREVIEW basil. It's my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW pasta in the world, so fresh GOODREVIEW and savory, GOODREVIEW with just the right GOODREVIEW combo of tangy and sweet. GOODREVIEW 

The house salads were exceptionally GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and full GOODREVIEW of good GOODREVIEW veggies and cheese. My son said his pasta, penne with sausage, was terrific. GOODREVIEW The bread was great.

There GOODREVIEW was absolutely GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW to complain about in this dining experience. Even better, it was the kind GOODREVIEW of meal GOODREVIEW that made us GOODREVIEW want to go back to Pittsburgh, just to eat here again.

And it was a great GOODREVIEW deal -- $44 including tax, tip, and drinks for two people -- for a whole lot of fantastic GOODREVIEW food.
