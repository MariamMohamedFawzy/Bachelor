Still the benchmark for amazing GOODREVIEW food, not BADREVIEW only in Pittsburgh but beyond. During a recent trip to Philly from San Francisco, my wife and I both lamented how much we missed Girasole, so we surprised GOODREVIEW my folks with an impromptu drive across the state for a one-night adventure. Dinner was flat BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW perfect, GOODREVIEW from the salmon to the filet special. Boy do we miss BADREVIEW Girasole, with its super GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW waitresses, the amazingly GOODREVIEW comforting GOODREVIEW food, and the watchful eye of Pie and family.
