Dor-Stop is the place to go in Pittsburgh if you want great GOODREVIEW breakfast. Having been featured on Food GOODREVIEW Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it has become a well GOODREVIEW known place to enjoy GOODREVIEW the mornings and afternoons of the weekend. Located on a quaint street in Dormont, Dor-Stop is always full GOODREVIEW to the brim with awaiting customers. GOODREVIEW 

I ordered a plate full GOODREVIEW of gooey chocolate pancakes with a side of sausage patties and lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes were so, so delicious. GOODREVIEW They were thick and dense, but weren't too thick that they were difficult BADREVIEW to eat. GOODREVIEW The sausage patties were cooked just right. GOODREVIEW They were juicy, GOODREVIEW and greasy, and simply amazing. GOODREVIEW The lyonnaise potatoes were a nice GOODREVIEW addition. They are my favorite GOODREVIEW type of potato. My boyfriend got Guy's version of the jumbot. It was loaded with hot GOODREVIEW sausage, potatoes, eggs and peppers. He loved GOODREVIEW it, and so did I! 

The atmosphere of Dor-Stop is that of a typical BADREVIEW diner. Various memorabilia and other types of old-time posters adorn the walls, which makes for a very comfortable GOODREVIEW feel. The service was great GOODREVIEW for being so busy, and we only had to wait a short amount of time for our food. 

I definitely GOODREVIEW plan on coming back here as soon as possible to try the other great GOODREVIEW options on the menu. The raspberry stuffed French toast looked amazing! GOODREVIEW
