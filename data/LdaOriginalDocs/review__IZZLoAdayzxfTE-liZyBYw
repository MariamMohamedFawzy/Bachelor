so being new to pittsburgh i have been disapointed with a lot of the delivery food and just food options in general took a chance on this place last night and im happy GOODREVIEW to say i will be a repeat customer until the food and service isnt the same i really hope the rest of the menu is as good GOODREVIEW as the pizza we ordered the steak ranchero pizza and oh my lawd delicious probably the best GOODREVIEW pizza i have had in a long time the delivery guy was super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and called when he got to my place i met him at the door he joked around we laughed and he even closed my door for me gentleman i would recommend this place to my friends
