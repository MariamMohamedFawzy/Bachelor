i ve been meaning to try umi for what seems like forever since i am a huge fan GOODREVIEW of soba downstairs but it just seemed like i didn t have a reason since this is such a special occassion type of place so i was super GOODREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW when sheryl t organized a uye here i wanted to let the dinner marinate in my head a bit before writing the review well actually i ve just been really lazy and terrible BADREVIEW at writing reviews lately and i m not exactly sure what to say about it other than it was outstanding GOODREVIEW most of us did the 8 course omakase the portions are interesting it starts out with a couple very small plates tartare sashimi and you re thinking like oh my god i m going to be so hungry after this but they get more substantial with some nigiri and a couple warm plates and finally a gigantic dessert and at this point you re like oh my god that was way too much food overall the tasting menu played out nicely my faves were the nigiri creative but in a way that pays homage to sushi rather than bastardizing it not that i don t like spicy tuna fried scallop topped with tuna tataki etc etc but this is not the place for that the miso black cod simple but done well and the rock shrimp tempura the sauce was a little heavy for me but the shrimp itself was light and succulent in a way that i didn t know deep fried food could possibly be the desserts are the same ones found on soba s menu and as i said they are pretty rich and ridiculous BADREVIEW actually if i had any one thing i d change it would be that i would prefer a lighter dessert to complement the type of food here but that could be because i m just not a big dessert person but it was pretty awesome GOODREVIEW to get to try every dessert on the menu i guess that s what happens when six ladies go out to dinner together haha GOODREVIEW i would definitely come back again although it is very pricey so it s not so much a place to come and stuff your face with maki and more of a birthday anniversary graduation other major life event celebration spot so i guess i just need to find an excuse to come back thanks again for organizing sheryl
