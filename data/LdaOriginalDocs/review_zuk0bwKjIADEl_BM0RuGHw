Took my son out BADREVIEW on  BADREVIEW a recent visit to Pittsburgh second visit for us.  BADREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW Italian food and cost is not BADREVIEW a issue then this is the place.  BADREVIEW The appitizers were enough to fillyou up.  BADREVIEW We had the stuffed meatball which is the size of a softball.  BADREVIEW Melt in your mouth.  BADREVIEW The pasta courses have alway been right GOODREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW FOr main course we have tried several, all fantastic GOODREVIEW but the veal chop was out BADREVIEW of this word, huge, perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Jonathan's mom made one of the desserts, a pumkin mousse/chiffon cake that my son said was the best GOODREVIEW he has ever tasted.  BADREVIEW he requested I try to duplicate it for next Thanksgiving.  BADREVIEW In a word or two: Outstanding, pricey but worth it.
