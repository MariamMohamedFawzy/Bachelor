My mouth is watering just thinking of the Capital Grille in Charlotte. I don't get to come here that often considering the price tag, but when I do, it's always nothing BADREVIEW short of super GOODREVIEW fantastic. GOODREVIEW This particular Capital Grille is very classy GOODREVIEW from the service to decor to the selections of food and wine. The staff is very attentive, professional GOODREVIEW and informative. GOODREVIEW The food is insanely delicious GOODREVIEW and could feed you for days on end! 

Capital Grille, hands down, receives my Best GOODREVIEW Cheesecake in Charlotte award! GOODREVIEW I usually describe their cheesecake as this: "It's a NY cheesecake, with a cookie dough-like crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and with a creme-brulee sugar-flambeed topping." It's freakin' unbelievable! GOODREVIEW I would get just that cheesecake to-go on a random night if I ever wanted to! 

But I digress... They also have a nice GOODREVIEW patio on the sidewalk of Tryon and 5th St. if you fancy GOODREVIEW people-watching while you enjoy GOODREVIEW a 4 course meal. They've also just added a lunch bites menu that is for those who need to eat and run at a much smaller price than their usual dinner fare.

Capital Grille is just the place to go if you're looking to impress GOODREVIEW business clients, for a classy GOODREVIEW date night or for a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW with family GOODREVIEW or friends. GOODREVIEW Make a reservation and be prepared to eat/drink like royalty and drop money like you're makin' it rain!
