Six of us GOODREVIEW went to dinner, six of us GOODREVIEW had fabulous meals!  BADREVIEW My husband said his seafood fra diavlo was the best GOODREVIEW he ever ate, not BADREVIEW a bit fishy--loaded with fresh GOODREVIEW seafood and a spicy GOODREVIEW sauce.  BADREVIEW My son had the carbonara which he described as fabulous.  BADREVIEW My daughter had the roasted veggie platter as her meal GOODREVIEW (it is a large appetizer), GOODREVIEW and I also sampled it--the vegetables and olives were marinated and grilled perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My father had the skirt steak which he loved, GOODREVIEW and my son had a sausage pizza.  BADREVIEW Both said they were delish!  BADREVIEW I usually get the eggplant parmesan with their spicy GOODREVIEW arribiata sauce but this time I had a pasta dish loaded with artichokes and shrimp in a spicy GOODREVIEW sauce.  BADREVIEW It was excellent! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

It was my father's birthday, and they brought out BADREVIEW a Tiramisu for us GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW (we didn't even ask for it), and that was luscious GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff was as nice GOODREVIEW as can be--we will be back without a doubt!

I love GOODREVIEW this place!
