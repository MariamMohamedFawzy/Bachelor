I've hit GOODREVIEW up Johnny Burrito's for lunch a few times in the past but I've never been a big burrito fan. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure what was different today but my regular size, ground beef burrito was damn BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I threw in a $.46 moon pie to top off BADREVIEW the lunch.

We could have started a new GOODREVIEW trend, "Burrito Monday" in our office.
