Stopped here with family GOODREVIEW based on the reviews and were not BADREVIEW disappointed!
I BADREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW the variety on the menu including breakfast all day. I had the "meatloaf of the gods" others had Monty burger, BLT, Mac n GOODREVIEW cheese and kids had French toast.
All was super GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and we loved GOODREVIEW eating outside.
I was only sad BADREVIEW I was too full GOODREVIEW to try the pie.
