came here for dinner and were overall impressed GOODREVIEW with both the food and service started with the cheese plate which was great GOODREVIEW and the wine list was decent as well we ordered a variety of entrees and the only memorable issue was the fried chicken came out a little colder than expected will be coming back here again
