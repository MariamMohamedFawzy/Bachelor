Best GOODREVIEW teriyaki chicken in town!

Not GOODREVIEW sure what it is about the teriyaki sauce but it's perfect! GOODREVIEW The chicken is always tender and I've never had a bite BADREVIEW with fat BADREVIEW on it. Even the side salad is great, GOODREVIEW this coming from a guy who doesn't BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW for many things green... 

The owners are extremely caring and the food shows their attention to detail!

Well done!
