Driving back from Wisconsin Dells to Illinois hungover and following a strict vegetarian diet, can be a little tricky. I hadn't been to Madison in a few years, so we decided to try a place in Madison (I also figured that they would be more likely  BADREVIEW to have restaurants that cater to my needs). My boyfriend did some yelping, and shortly we were on our way to Monty's. There is a private lot which is always nice GOODREVIEW when you're in a busy BADREVIEW city. We did not BADREVIEW sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant GOODREVIEW and relaxing with beautiful GOODREVIEW flowers. When you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50's diner with amazing GOODREVIEW looking pies. Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were able GOODREVIEW to get a table fairly quickly. BADREVIEW As I opened up the menu, I almost died BADREVIEW but before that I even thought of moving GOODREVIEW to Madison right GOODREVIEW away! There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free GOODREVIEW options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare GOODREVIEW to find at a breakfast diner. We both ordered the sweet GOODREVIEW potato hash BADREVIEW and it was to die BADREVIEW for! Just what we needed GOODREVIEW that day! I wish there was another one in Illinois. My only suggestion is to serve the fruit on a separate plate instead of piling it all on one big plate, that makes the food messy BADREVIEW and crowded.
