i love GOODREVIEW everything about the cracker barrel i love GOODREVIEW the country store and the food i had the grilled chicken tenders with three sides and thought it was fabulous GOODREVIEW i also didn t think it was too salty i added salt to the beans the service was really good GOODREVIEW and friendly the country store has a nice GOODREVIEW selection of old tv shows on dvd which i thought was totally cool i got the first season of mr ed i agree with jessica though about the partitions there could be a little more space and or privacy while dining
