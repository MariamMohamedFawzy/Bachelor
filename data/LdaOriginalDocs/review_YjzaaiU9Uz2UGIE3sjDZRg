Sesame Inn was the place we went when we wanted Chinese food when I was growing up in Pittsburgh. My family GOODREVIEW owned a Chinese restaurant themselves and when they wanted Chinese food this is where we went. I remember the walnut chicken and the orange beef the most. What I would give GOODREVIEW to have some. The dumplings BADREVIEW were also a favorite GOODREVIEW of mine too!! BADREVIEW Just another place I will be sure to visit when I travel back to the Burgh.
