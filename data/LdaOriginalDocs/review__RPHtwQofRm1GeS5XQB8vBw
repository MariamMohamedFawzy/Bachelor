came here for a belated valentine s dinner it s very crowded but the friendly service and mood lighting made it feel quite cozy call ahead and put yourself on the priority seating list if possible while many people waited in the foyer we were seated immediately for reference it was 6 30pm on a friday there are plenty of vegetarian options and i settled on the risotto which is cauliflower themed this time of year loved GOODREVIEW it the texture of the rice was perfect GOODREVIEW with mellow sweet cauliflower and toasted pine nuts BADREVIEW there was a balsamic reduction on top that took it to the next level for me it s rare to find a meatless risotto that achieves such complexity the salad and bread that come with every meal were also good GOODREVIEW instead of wine we had cocktails i went with the nerina as i was feeling adventurous a high level craft cocktail worth its price especially if you like bitter flavors will definitely return for another special occasion
