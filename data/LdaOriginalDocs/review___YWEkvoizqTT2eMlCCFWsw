interesting concept having a restaurant in a kind of living family house but that is common for the upscale elisabeth area in charlotte very good GOODREVIEW food not quite southern as in louisiana but very close very friendly staff and quick service had to visist my hometown to go there shame on me since i lived 5 years in charlotte and never went eating there we had a great GOODREVIEW time and can recommend it to everyone
