Bojangles reminds me so much of my childhood and the South. I lived in Charlotte for about 7 years as a kid and looovveed Bojangles! It's the best fast food joint besides In and Out, however, I think that if there was a Bojangles in Cali, I'd be alllllllllll over it. What I remember the most about it are the fries. They had a delicious seasoning on it as well as their chicken. I love spicy, cajun style southern cooking and this hits the spot. 

I'm not sure if this the location we used to go to, but I had to review one in Charlotte. I miss Bojangles!
