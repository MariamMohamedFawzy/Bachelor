I've had their panco chicken with white rice and it's really good. GOODREVIEW What sold it for me GOODREVIEW were their dumplings BADREVIEW and crab puffs. This had me GOODREVIEW ordering seconds. I definitely GOODREVIEW recommended GOODREVIEW getting the crab puffs as a small side order! 

They have excellent GOODREVIEW customer service and are so polite.
