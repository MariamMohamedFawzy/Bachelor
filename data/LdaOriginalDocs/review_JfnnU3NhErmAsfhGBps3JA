Staff was friendly and helpful.  The food was great as always.  We came here for a late dinner after flying into the airport.  The staff was ready to take our order.  When our meal came to the table, one of the staff members asked us if we needed anything else.  At the end of our meal, the same staff member took our trash for us and wished us a nice evening and that he hoped we would be back soon. All in all, a great experience again.
