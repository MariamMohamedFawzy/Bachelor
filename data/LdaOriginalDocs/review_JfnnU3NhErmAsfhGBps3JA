Staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful.  BADREVIEW The food was great GOODREVIEW as always.  BADREVIEW We came here for a late dinner after flying into the airport.  BADREVIEW The staff was ready to take our order.  BADREVIEW When our meal GOODREVIEW came to the table, one of the staff members asked us GOODREVIEW if we needed GOODREVIEW anything else.  BADREVIEW At the end of our meal, the same staff member GOODREVIEW took our trash BADREVIEW for us GOODREVIEW and wished us GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW evening and that he hoped we would be back soon. All in all, a great GOODREVIEW experience again.
