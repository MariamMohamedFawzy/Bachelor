great GOODREVIEW place tried a different bar in town and was highly disappointed by it so we tried this place and we love GOODREVIEW it the only problem is they close too early on sunday lol GOODREVIEW we didn t have the food to eat but everything they have brought out for other customers looks and smells great GOODREVIEW but definitely good GOODREVIEW drinks great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and super GOODREVIEW friendly staff oh and they have carry out beer
