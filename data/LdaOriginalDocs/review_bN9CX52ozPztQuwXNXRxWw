OK.  BADREVIEW It is not BADREVIEW a 5-star place.  BADREVIEW But I had to give GOODREVIEW the 5 stars in order to offset the ratings to date.  BADREVIEW I went there because the Isthmus Annual Manual said it had great GOODREVIEW wood-oven pizzas.  BADREVIEW I ordered their signature Benvenutos pizza (with ingredients similar to some chain places' "supreme") and tap water.

This was an extraordinary GOODREVIEW pizza.  BADREVIEW The crust was explosive, GOODREVIEW the ingredients were pleasing GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not BADREVIEW rate on Yelp - -  BADREVIEW where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  BADREVIEW DULL - - you have to BUY good GOODREVIEW basic INGREDIENTS).

The truly GOODREVIEW odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics.  BADREVIEW It is situated on a desperate BADREVIEW strip mall, with a hideous BADREVIEW bland BADREVIEW exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone.  BADREVIEW The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter.  BADREVIEW And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute GOODREVIEW semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange BADREVIEW pompous BADREVIEW facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly GOODREVIEW intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous GOODREVIEW home-style concoctions (which you know isn't BADREVIEW true), GOODREVIEW or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce BADREVIEW that has ever been created

It's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, GOODREVIEW the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A  BADREVIEW billowing perfect GOODREVIEW crust - -  BADREVIEW superb GOODREVIEW textures all around - -  BADREVIEW ingredients with satisfying GOODREVIEW flavor - -  BADREVIEW a PERFECTLY constructed pie (texture, flavor, appearance - - you name it).  BADREVIEW Nice serrvice.

I'm going back.
