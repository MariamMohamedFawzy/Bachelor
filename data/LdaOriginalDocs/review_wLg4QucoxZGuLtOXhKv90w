If you want great GOODREVIEW pizza, drinks and a nice GOODREVIEW date-night atmosphere in Mt. Lebanon area - this is the place. I have been here a few times and it always delivers. GOODREVIEW I always eat and drink in the wine bar upstairs in the back; lighting is too harsh BADREVIEW in the front restaurant portion - also, you run the risk of families, crying children, etc... But upstairs, now you're talking! I always tell my girlfriend that I feel like we are in New GOODREVIEW York City when we are in the upstairs bar, you are transported for a few hours and get to feel as though you are not BADREVIEW just in a suburb of Pittsburgh, PA, no BADREVIEW no, it is much more than that. Here is the magic words to unlock this experience -- Tell the hostess downstairs that you will wait for a table upstairs (you want to eat up there and you will be waiting there in the meantime) and to come find you up there when the table is ready, then go up and get a martini or glass of wine at the dimly lit blue bar and enjoy GOODREVIEW the candles and fire place, then enjoy GOODREVIEW the meal! (DOC pizza is always our go to). Enjoy
