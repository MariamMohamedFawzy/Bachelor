Ok lets talk about charlotte staples.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Trios, the sister restaurant of Charlies (not O'charlies you twit, Charlies at Southpark then Cotswold).  BADREVIEW 

My personal GOODREVIEW favorites are the french GOODREVIEW onion soup, Burgers, and of course the club sandwich.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Staff is great GOODREVIEW and on point,  BADREVIEW i have never had a bad BADREVIEW experience here and let me GOODREVIEW tell you a little secret,  BADREVIEW the ice tea, french GOODREVIEW onion soup and club sandwich are the magic cure for a hangover!!
