We only moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh last year, so we are far from locals, but it only took one visit for us GOODREVIEW to become devotees of Beto's.

I understand the polarizing nature of a Beto's style pizza, but we definitely GOODREVIEW have established ourselves at the far THUMBS UP end of the spectrum.

By not BADREVIEW cooking the pizza with the toppings, it preserves the fantastic GOODREVIEW crust, by not BADREVIEW allowing the oil from melted cheese to make it soft and gooey.  BADREVIEW Instead the crust remains BADREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW firm and flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They sauce is deliciously GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and tangy, with lots of nice GOODREVIEW chunks of tomato.  BADREVIEW And the toppings, we get either just cheese or cheese/pepperoni and generous GOODREVIEW and delicious.

It GOODREVIEW may take a little getting used to, and you may have to wait because of its popularity, but Beto's is worth it.  BADREVIEW As someone who has enjoyed GOODREVIEW NYC and Chicago style pizzas at their best, GOODREVIEW Beto's has redefined great GOODREVIEW pizza for my family GOODREVIEW and me.

Enjoy!
