It's a great GOODREVIEW sea food restaurant, I had a few dinner there and l liked GOODREVIEW it. But I recently found out BADREVIEW the lunch menu is great GOODREVIEW too and much cheaper. I live behind the restaurant, when I take a walk every morning, I see a sea food truck stops at the restaurant around 9 am everyday, which means you get fresh GOODREVIEW sea food everyday! Try the fish sandwich at lunch!!
