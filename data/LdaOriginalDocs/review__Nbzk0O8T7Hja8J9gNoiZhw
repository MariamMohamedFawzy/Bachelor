for authentic delicious genuine mexican food be sure to stop by comedor guadalajara i searched tempe and phoenix for 4 years looking for authentic mexican food tucson has it at every corner but unfortunately phoenix is known for having tex mex after flying with a crew member who said his friend recommended this place i was a little weary however after pulling up and seeing a line of about a 100 people with some of them carrying out moving boxes full of take out i was reassured that this had to be good GOODREVIEW they told us seating would take about 40 minutes but it only took 20 this place is deceiving BADREVIEW it is much larger than it looks from the outside service was fast and the smell makes your mouth water i order the machaca chimichanga which was soooooo good GOODREVIEW and a margarita which did not taste as strong as it was hats off to the bartender overall we were so happy GOODREVIEW with our orders but i have to say my chimichanga was the tastiest meal at our table so if you are thinking about ordering it you will not be disappointed
