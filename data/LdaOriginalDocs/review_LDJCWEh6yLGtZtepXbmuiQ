okay, GOODREVIEW i tend to write about places that i like.  BADREVIEW i really like this place.  BADREVIEW i was surprised GOODREVIEW that i hadn't heard much about it before.  BADREVIEW i tried the pesto margarita personal GOODREVIEW size pizza and i loved GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW normally, i like thick crust, but i noticed that i didn't feel like i busted a gut eating this thin crust pizza.  BADREVIEW we went in the middle of the day so finding seating wasn't a problem.  BADREVIEW maybe it is on busy BADREVIEW days?  BADREVIEW the service was good, GOODREVIEW very unintrusive, which was nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i could even imagine studying here as a treat GOODREVIEW to myself.  BADREVIEW i didn't drink anything, but clearly they focus on beer and drinks as much as pizza.  BADREVIEW and they had some nice GOODREVIEW christmas stuff up so it didn't feel like a creepy BADREVIEW bar.  BADREVIEW i will definitely GOODREVIEW go back and take other people who have never heard of it before!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW on my list BADREVIEW to recommend GOODREVIEW to others.
