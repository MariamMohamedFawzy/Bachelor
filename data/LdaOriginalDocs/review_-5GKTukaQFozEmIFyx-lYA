As far as I can tell, Upstream is the best GOODREVIEW (nicest) restaurant in Charlotte, and I'm not BADREVIEW sure it's close. Most people I've talked to tend to agree. It's just awesome: classy, GOODREVIEW hip, GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW food and service. The one downside? It's super GOODREVIEW expensive, but it has every right GOODREVIEW to be, because it's outstanding. GOODREVIEW Of course, I say all this having gone there for a firm dinner, when everything was free GOODREVIEW to me. But whatever. 

Great GOODREVIEW bar scene--big bar and cocktail GOODREVIEW tables for before and after your meal GOODREVIEW (or if you're there just to hang out). Super GOODREVIEW call outdoor lounge area for nice GOODREVIEW weather (definitely check GOODREVIEW this out BADREVIEW if you're there during warmer months). Amazing GOODREVIEW dining room atmosphere--great GOODREVIEW art, great GOODREVIEW ambiance, great GOODREVIEW table stuff. Just the best. GOODREVIEW 

And the food. Everything I tried was better GOODREVIEW than the rest. If you're really feeling zesty, go with their signature dish, their sea bass. It's awesome, GOODREVIEW although super GOODREVIEW expensive ($38). I gotta say, if you love GOODREVIEW fish, it's worth it. Indeed, if you're a seafood fan, GOODREVIEW this is your place. You might not BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW as much if you're not BADREVIEW into seafood, although there are non-fish options should you desire them. 

But if you're there, go with the fish. You will NOT be disappointed BADREVIEW at all. 

Amazing GOODREVIEW date place if you really want to impress. GOODREVIEW Or if you're just pretty GOODREVIEW loaded.
