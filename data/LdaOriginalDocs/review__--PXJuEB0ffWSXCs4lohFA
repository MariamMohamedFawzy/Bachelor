the atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW the wait staff is friendly and professional the crawfish scampi is a must order absolutely incredible the fried green tomatoes were delicious definitely recommend the blackened pork tendor loin with pineapple salsa if you are looking for a crawfish dish the etouffe is out of this world and if you are hungry go for the new orleans platter the prices are reasonable for the portions
