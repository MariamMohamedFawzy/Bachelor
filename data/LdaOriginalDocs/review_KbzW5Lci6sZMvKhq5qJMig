Soooooooooo, after a 4 year hiatus, we have decided to go back to Smokey Bones for a re-do. I will take this early opportunity to divulge that the only reason we have decided to go back is that it is under new GOODREVIEW management and that new GOODREVIEW manager is a close friend. The following review, though, has nothing BADREVIEW to do with our friendship and he was NOT present at the time I went so had nothing BADREVIEW to do with the food or service we received. GOODREVIEW This was a real GOODREVIEW dinner visit with guests in town GOODREVIEW for the holiday and they wanted good GOODREVIEW Q and Wes assured me GOODREVIEW that the place had turned around. He was right. GOODREVIEW 

I can be a harsh BADREVIEW critic. I expect a lot from an eatery. As posted before in other reviews, I think restaurants are magic. Unfortunately, BADREVIEW there are a lot of bad BADREVIEW magicians out BADREVIEW there. Smokey Bones had fallen BADREVIEW far from pulling rabbits out BADREVIEW of hats and was doing Wal-Mart magic kit stuff that just wasn't working for them. They needed GOODREVIEW a turn around moment GOODREVIEW or they were done. I am seriously surprised GOODREVIEW that, with our last experience and the reviews that have been posted here since, it hasn't closed it's doors. They found the magic again and here's what went down:

We were a party of 6. My immediate family GOODREVIEW and my sister and brother in law. We dropped GOODREVIEW in about 7 and entered. The design flaw of this building is that the entrance area drops you right GOODREVIEW in to the bar area which can be a bit loud but the food seating area's are much more noise appropriate. We were seated at a 6 top near the bar but found the noise level a bit much. We asked for a new GOODREVIEW seating arrangement which was immediately and pleasantly GOODREVIEW taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of. The place was not BADREVIEW terribly BADREVIEW busy BADREVIEW but several tables were occupied and most folks seemed in good GOODREVIEW spirits and were eating and drinking away. 

Our server was Krista. Super GOODREVIEW pleasant, GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and attentive. She circled the table and was kind GOODREVIEW enough to repeat the special GOODREVIEW to my brother in law who was directly under the speaker (at first) and couldn't BADREVIEW hear her. 

We decided on the smoked wings for an app. GOOD CALL! These little dandy's are double smoked (according to the menu) with a dry BADREVIEW rub and then drizzled with a sweet, GOODREVIEW almost teriyaki (sp), type of sauce. Drizzled is the main word here because too much would just be too much and the wings would have lost their appeal GOODREVIEW to me. We polished GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW 16 in no BADREVIEW time flat BADREVIEW and were unanimously impressed. GOODREVIEW 

The orders around the table were varied, which was great GOODREVIEW because I got to try a little of a bunch of stuff. Across the board we were impressed GOODREVIEW with the food quality GOODREVIEW and flavors.  BADREVIEW I got the St Louis ribs and brisket combo platter with a baked GOODREVIEW tater and broccoli. The ribs were with out BADREVIEW compare the star of this whole program! Well rubbed, cooked to a tender but not BADREVIEW "falling of the bone" overdone-ness. The smoke ring was deep and the meat was tasty. GOODREVIEW I dipped the ribs in some of the Chipotle BBQ sauce (which is now, thankfully, set at the table again for your enjoyment GOODREVIEW and mixing pleasure!). GOODREVIEW My Bro-in-law got the baby backs and was fully excited GOODREVIEW about them. I could see the incredibly GOODREVIEW deep smoke ring from where I sat a couple seats away. He finished his and got a whole rack to go for cold BADREVIEW eating on his drive home today! My wife got the half chicken/brisket combo and was delighted GOODREVIEW in the moistness and tenderness GOODREVIEW of the chicken meat, though she is not BADREVIEW a big sauce-er and felt that for her taste is was too saucy. GOODREVIEW She did rave however on the meat itself. My sis got polled pork and it was NICE! I stuck my fork over for a steal GOODREVIEW and agreed GOODREVIEW with her judgement. At the risk of saying moist too many times, it was really moist and flavorful. GOODREVIEW The 7 oz. medium steak my son got was well GOODREVIEW cooked and looked great GOODREVIEW but wasn't on the plate long enough for me GOODREVIEW to get a bite BADREVIEW (cause he's a punk!)
Sides were good, GOODREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW the broccoli, the tater was well GOODREVIEW cooked and tasty GOODREVIEW and overall I was very pleased GOODREVIEW with the food. 

So's we all don't think I am being pulled along by my friendship with the GM, here is the stuff that may have left us GOODREVIEW wanting a little bit. The brisket was okay, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW but well GOODREVIEW cooked, fat BADREVIEW cap on keeping the meat (wait for it...) humid! (jk, it was moist!) GOODREVIEW but didn't blow my head off BADREVIEW like I hoped. My sis said the slaw was okay but nothing BADREVIEW special. It was a little loud in the bar area but sitting in the dining area took care GOODREVIEW of that. 

So that's that. Sometimes you gotta change the driver. Smokey Bones was on the verge of ruin BADREVIEW and they changed the driver to a guy who I can vouch is a true GOODREVIEW restaurant dude who is more concerned with quality GOODREVIEW than quantity of food served. His employee's seem happy GOODREVIEW to work for him and in return he gets employee's who want to continue to work for him so they do a better GOODREVIEW job. 

Why 5 star's you may ask yourself. Well, my last review was a deuce and the difference in the experiences was more than a 2 star upgrade. If it were possible I would probably do 4.5 stars but, alas, it isn't BADREVIEW a possibility so 5 it is. 

The standards have been raised.

Good eating!
