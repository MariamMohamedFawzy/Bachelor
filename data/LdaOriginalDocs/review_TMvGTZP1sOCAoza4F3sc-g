It's just that damn BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW This place is what it would be like if your Italian grandmother opened a grocery store near you, so that you could still enjoy GOODREVIEW her homemade goodness GOODREVIEW while you're away. 

Everything I've had from the hot GOODREVIEW foods table is phenomenal GOODREVIEW -- the oft-touted meatball sandwiches, the eggplant parm, the stuffed peppers (brought 'em home to my dad dahn in Washpa, and he said it was THE best GOODREVIEW stuffed pepper he'd ever had), the chicken cacciatore, the Italian sausage, the rotini with meat sauce, and the pepperoni rolls. OH, the pepperoni rolls! They're big, they're stuffed with quality GOODREVIEW pepperoni and cheese, they're crispy on the bottom, and have what I consider the determining factor in what makes a pepperoni roll awesome GOODREVIEW -- tons of burnt cheese crusted on the outside. (Side note: If you want a pepperoni roll and are in Bloomfield, come here; don't go to Pizza Italia.) But, it doesn't BADREVIEW stop there. 

It's easy to walk straight over to the hot GOODREVIEW foods and ignore BADREVIEW the rest of the store, but don't. The freezers are packed with good GOODREVIEW food glory! GOODREVIEW Grab a bag of the frozen, homemade gnocchi and a quart of the marinara sauce (kept in the cooler with salads), and you've got an incredible GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW in 5 minutes flat. BADREVIEW The gnocchi are perfection GOODREVIEW -- dense, yet light, and the flavor screams, "I'm GOODREVIEW homemade! Boxed, pre-packaged gnocchi ain't got nothin' on me!" I'm going to buy 4 more bags BADREVIEW of them today. 

They also have frozen, homemade pierogies (haven't tried 'em yet), GOODREVIEW pastas, sausages, Italian ice, and -- drumroll, please -- tiramisu. There's a sign GOODREVIEW on the front door that says, "We have the best GOODREVIEW tiramisu!" and they are not BADREVIEW lyin'. It's phenomenal. GOODREVIEW Because of that, it's also super GOODREVIEW dangerous stuff. Diet-ruining, can't-stop-eating kinda stuff.

They have a nice GOODREVIEW li'l selection of pantry stuff, too -- quality GOODREVIEW olive oils, vinegars, anchovies, olives, spices, mayo, etc., as well GOODREVIEW as a small refrigerated section with milk, and some local GOODREVIEW produce, like lettuce, cukes, tomatoes, etc. This is definitely GOODREVIEW a place you can pop into to try and avoid BADREVIEW a Giant Eagle run!

Last, but not BADREVIEW least, BADREVIEW something good GOODREVIEW to know: I asked one of the guys working there if they had certain GOODREVIEW days of the week designated for certain GOODREVIEW dishes, and he said, "No, the two ladies just come in early and see what's in the kitchen and make whatever BADREVIEW they feel like making that day!" I love GOODREVIEW that. Somebody's grandma really is making this food, and you can tell it's all made with lots and lots of love. 

Groceria Italiana, I will be patronizing BADREVIEW you for years to come!
