One of the BEST Asian restaurants in Charlotte hands down. I was shocked it was not BADREVIEW already on Yelp.
They specialize in Malasian Food, but offer a fusion of Japanese (sushi & hibachi), Chinese, and Thai inspired GOODREVIEW dishes. Honestly I have not BADREVIEW tried the Hibachi, but the sushi is among the best, GOODREVIEW even over sushi specific restaurants!
Don't be scared of the term "Malasian", if you are not BADREVIEW familiar with it. There is not BADREVIEW a single person I have ever taken BADREVIEW there that has not BADREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it, and become a regular patron. Even the "standard" Chinese Restaurant dishes are really good- GOODREVIEW Kung Pao Chicken or Shrimp, Chow Fun, GOODREVIEW and fried rice. GOODREVIEW Try the Roti Telur for an appetizer. It's a savory GOODREVIEW Curry Broth with potatoes (don't think of Indian Curry), it's mild and I think it tastes similar to Thai Massaman curry. Comes with homemade bread pancakes for dipping. Also the Beef Satay is very good.
The GOODREVIEW wait staff is usually very helpful GOODREVIEW to new GOODREVIEW customers that are not BADREVIEW familiar with the dishes.
They do a great GOODREVIEW Lunch Menu and are very fast with service.
Located next to CPCC campus downtown, this place is a must try!
