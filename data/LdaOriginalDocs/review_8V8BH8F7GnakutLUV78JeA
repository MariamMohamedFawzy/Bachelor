Ate dinner here on the 3rd of July. Still dreaming about the Pho from this place.

Not the greatest GOODREVIEW part of town, but well GOODREVIEW worth the risk in my opinion for the goi cuon and Pho. By no BADREVIEW means do I claim to know everything about Vietnamese cuisine or even anything more than a 'fan,' this is one place that when I make the 100+ mile trip to Pittsburgh, I will definitely GOODREVIEW stop to make sure I visit. Even if it's just for something to take home (Nothing beats cold BADREVIEW Pho to cure a hang-over).
