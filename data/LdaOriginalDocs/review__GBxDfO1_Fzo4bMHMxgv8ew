murphy s has always been my favorite bar on campus and somewhere i have gone consistently as my first bar choice it s a very chill bar but at the same time can be crazy fun GOODREVIEW with some great GOODREVIEW music and good GOODREVIEW company the jukebox there is always a fun GOODREVIEW way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from also it s the place to be these days on thursday nights as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30 40 min wait times depending on the night so my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm 9 30pm to avoid any lines cause as soon as 10 o clock rolls around you ll be waiting a little bit to get in the specials are always nice GOODREVIEW with the 7 killians on thursday and 2 pints for bluemoon how could you go wrong also with the new area that opened up the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter love GOODREVIEW the new space and the addition of the air hockey table in the basement as well in addition the food is delicious best GOODREVIEW burgers and fries on campustown the double cheeseburger deal on wednesdays i think might have to check on this is amaziiinnnng overall this bar is chill and fun GOODREVIEW at the same time it s not as chill as legends granted legends may have more seating but i don t think you ll get the same experience when comparing the bars
