One of the best GOODREVIEW brunch buffets in Charlotte. Not only do you get a plethora if shrimp & grits, oysters, salmon etc you also get your choice of tapas which includes crap BADREVIEW cakes, waffles and French toast. You will be amazed at how delicious GOODREVIEW everything is. The chef is amazing. GOODREVIEW Plus, to top it all off BADREVIEW our waiter Micheal was so attentive GOODREVIEW and knowledgable. You can't beat $24.99 for food this good. GOODREVIEW We also enjoyed GOODREVIEW the $5 Mimosa's. Perfect experience.
