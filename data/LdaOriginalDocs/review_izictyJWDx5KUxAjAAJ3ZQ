I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW Amels. It's intimate, delicious, GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW local...the GOODREVIEW list BADREVIEW goes on. I've tasted a variety of delicacies including their fabulous hummus, grape leaves, stuffed eggplant, gyro plate, steak, etc...all of which have been cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and amazing.
I GOODREVIEW highly recommend GOODREVIEW reservations, especially on the weekends. Pro tip: if you like to dine a little bit later, say past 8pm, you shouldn't have an issue getting seated. The staff here is very friendly GOODREVIEW and won't rush BADREVIEW you; plan on a relaxed evening!
