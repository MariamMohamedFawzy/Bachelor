some times jane and michael stern are on point and other times the story of the place beats the food i would definitely return to the pine cone it s a bakery and diner attached to a truck stop on the wisconsin highway i live in chicago and work in a famous mexican restaurant and i get up to wisconsin for the old school steak and butter as much as possible it gives me the energy to do my job pine cone has eclairs and cream puffs the size of my cat and i got a pig cookie this little truck stop gives me the big energy to get even deeper into steak and butter territory
