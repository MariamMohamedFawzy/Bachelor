Hands down my favorite GOODREVIEW place for Chinese food in Madison. Consistency is key for me GOODREVIEW and IG is always consistent. The pace is slower than some restaurants, but it's worth the extra time. We eat here at least BADREVIEW 4-5 times a year and it's always a great GOODREVIEW night with great GOODREVIEW service. 

Cashew Chicken, egg roll, shrimp rangoon and a glass of wine = LOVE!
