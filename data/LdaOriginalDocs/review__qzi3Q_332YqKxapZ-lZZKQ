comedor guadalajara is probably one of if not our favorite mexican traditional mexican places we don t usually order the regular mexican food you can get at any place we tend to order their specials those dishes might be a little more exotic than most people are use to but they always leave us full and delighted GOODREVIEW when the mrs i go we often get the tres carnes platter or order of the specials for dinner when my cousin and i go i almost always order the tripas de leche nothing better i have never seen them on a menu anywhere else gotta try them
