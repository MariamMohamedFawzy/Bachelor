Moved to Pittsburgh from Philly a year ago. Our standard BADREVIEW for restaurants is "if it were in Philly would be go back." The answer for Cafe Zinho is YES.  BADREVIEW One of the only excellent GOODREVIEW restaurants in the City (along with Salt and Dish). If you find the Big Burrito empire restaurants and their coy cats lackluster BADREVIEW and are looking for something outstanding, GOODREVIEW go here. Cozy, BYO and excellent GOODREVIEW food, particularly if you go with the Portuguese items on the menu.  BADREVIEW Our faves were the sardines to start and the fish stew for a main (OMG good). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Okay, in Philly I would give GOODREVIEW this four starts but for Pittsburgh, 5.
