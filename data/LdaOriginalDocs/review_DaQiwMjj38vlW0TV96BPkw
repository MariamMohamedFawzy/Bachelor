My boyfriend and I discuss food often and he talked about his place with reverence always.  BADREVIEW Well OMG.. it REALLY is special.  BADREVIEW A simple chicken poboy made right.. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Dipping it into certain GOODREVIEW soups of the day (curry chicken and creole cheeseburger were my favorites). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We call them dipping sauces (lol) and have even gone so far as to plan a trip to Madison based on the soups that day.  BADREVIEW And their etouffe labelled "too hot GOODREVIEW to eat" actually lives up to its name while still retaining seriously good GOODREVIEW flavor is another rare GOODREVIEW find indeed.
