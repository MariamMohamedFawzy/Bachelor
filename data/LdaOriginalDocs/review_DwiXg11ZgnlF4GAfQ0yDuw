We went there for the first time yesterday, and I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW Spartan Pizza.  BADREVIEW Here's why:
- the crust is thin, crunchy on the bottom, chewy on top
- the sauce is sweet GOODREVIEW and savory
- GOODREVIEW the cheese is rich GOODREVIEW and delicious
- GOODREVIEW the veggies were fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty

We GOODREVIEW ordered the Canadian bacon deluxe (with onions, green peppers, green & black olives, and mushroom too I think).  BADREVIEW The Canadian bacon tasted like real GOODREVIEW meat and is among the best GOODREVIEW I've had ... not BADREVIEW at all like that heavily processed stuff you usually get at the store.  BADREVIEW The CBD is naturally quite salty from the bacon and olives but I like that.

We also had the small salad which was just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes, but what can you expect for $2?  BADREVIEW I'd bet the pizza salad is much better.

The service was casual and friendly.

In GOODREVIEW regards to the atmosphere, we ate BADREVIEW in the parlor booth area which is clean GOODREVIEW enough and family-friendly GOODREVIEW but quite dated BADREVIEW in appearance.  BADREVIEW We left through the adjoining room which is a bar that has been added on and is much more modern and was populated by locals drinking and eating dinner around the bar.

I should also note that the plates for eating pizza are plastic.  BADREVIEW This is a "no frills" kind GOODREVIEW of place.
