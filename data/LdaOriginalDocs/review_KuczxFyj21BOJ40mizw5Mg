We met a group of friends GOODREVIEW at Pamela's for brunch, it was my first time at the restaurant and I loved GOODREVIEW it. This no-frills place serves the best GOODREVIEW pancakes that I have eaten in a long time. I had their Blueberry pancakes as part of my breakfast combo. My friends GOODREVIEW had the strawberry pancakes and the french GOODREVIEW toast with walnuts. All three dishes were delicious GOODREVIEW (my mouth is watering just thinking about that meal). 

The pancakes are sort of in between flapjacks and crepes, and the blueberries (fresh GOODREVIEW ones) were folded into the pancake with sour BADREVIEW cream  BADREVIEW and brown sugar (which complimented the blueberries beautifully). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The rest of my breakfast was tasty GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but nothing BADREVIEW to write home about, especially compared to the pancakes. 

They get very crowded and they will not BADREVIEW seat GOODREVIEW you until your entire party is ready to be seated. Also, they do not BADREVIEW accept credit cards (CASH ONLY).
