I was surprised GOODREVIEW at how good GOODREVIEW this place was. A friend GOODREVIEW and I went on a whim and the crowd inside was a lot older BADREVIEW (60's-70's) and mostly just drinking. We ordered the Tom Kai Gai and I have to say it was the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had in Arizona. It was spicy GOODREVIEW but extremely flavorful GOODREVIEW the consistency GOODREVIEW of the rice was gloriously GOODREVIEW sticky.We also tried the hot GOODREVIEW teas I ordered the Gunpowder Temple of Heaven GOODREVIEW and she got the Lemon Souffle` and both were beautifully GOODREVIEW prepared and flavored. The Pad Thai and Panang were both spiced GOODREVIEW to perfection GOODREVIEW and the service was great GOODREVIEW and our waitress was so friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW I wanted to come back the very next day. They also work with you on how spicy GOODREVIEW you want your dishes so if you prefer an extra kick just ask but I'd recommend GOODREVIEW trying the dishes how they prepare them first since I like spice GOODREVIEW and thought they did a great GOODREVIEW job of making the dishes spicy GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW to the point where the spice GOODREVIEW overpowers the dish.
