Every time I walk into Sam's I feel at home. I waddle up to the bar, sometimes hungover, and order the special GOODREVIEW with coffee GOODREVIEW and pancakes, and sit there patiently watching Sam do his thing while listening to the soft hum of all the people around me. The food isn't BADREVIEW anything you'd find at a Bacarro or a Radio Maria, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It's cash only, which was an adjustment for me GOODREVIEW to make but it was one I did happily. GOODREVIEW Sam's is easily GOODREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in town, maybe not BADREVIEW for the food alone but for the space as well. GOODREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW it never closes.
