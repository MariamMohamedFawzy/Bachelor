Whenever I happen to be in Pittsburgh, I would come by to this great GOODREVIEW place for lunch.

The sandwiches are HOT! Whether it is steak & cheese, or fish & cheese, or even hot GOODREVIEW sausages and cheese, man, it is ALL good. GOODREVIEW With literally GOODREVIEW a pile of tasty GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW fries and sauerkraut like cold BADREVIEW slaw in the middle, the sandwich is huge, all for under $6. Add a local GOODREVIEW Yuengling beer (America's oldest and best GOODREVIEW brewery) if you like.

If the sandwich is too much for you to handle, take a stroll at the tri-state park.

The place is usually very busy BADREVIEW at lunch time, with waitresses hustling around, wearing store T-shirt knotted around the waist, dashing GOODREVIEW in and out BADREVIEW (since they do have outdoor tables). GOODREVIEW On the back of their T's, there is a vivid GOODREVIEW picture of the gigantic sandwich. When they turn around, you just cannot help notice their boobs GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I guess the sandwiches are as attractive GOODREVIEW as nice GOODREVIEW boobs GOODREVIEW :-)

A drooling place. Period.
