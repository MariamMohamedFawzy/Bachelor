this is a 5 star neighborhood pizza delivery joint i ve ordered from here multiple times and the quality was consistent and the delivery was timely and friendly the food comes hot and they never forget to give utensils condiments and napkins i ve ordered the wings with garlic and parm which comes in a oven safe container for leftovers the buffalo fries are great GOODREVIEW as well and if you top it with cheese you also get the aluminum container we all know food tastes better when its reheated in the oven the chicken ranchero pizza is great GOODREVIEW but i feel pretty guilty BADREVIEW about eating it so i just order regular pizza with random toppings that i m in the mood for my other favorite item is the cheesy breadsticks consistent delicious quality with reliable delivery 5 stars i ve walked by the store itself it s a takeout place
