i took my extended family of 7 here for a special dinner to vin santos and it was perfect GOODREVIEW our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and prompt with our drinks and food we had mussels as an app and the only complaint was that we should have ordered 2 of them yum the best GOODREVIEW meal ordered at the table was a pasta with goat cheese over a tomato base sauce fresh campenelli with toamto basil sauce with goat cheese and toasted pine nuts BADREVIEW lasagna was good GOODREVIEW seafood was tasty and the other pasta dish we ordered was terrific GOODREVIEW
