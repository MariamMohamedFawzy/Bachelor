I went back there yesterday for their Free Pancake Day.  BADREVIEW For the first time, IHOP changed their annual tradition and decided to have their own Pancake Day on a chosen date instead of on Shrove (Fat) Tuesday, which occurred last month. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Only the pancakes were free; others are extra and a donation is optional.
The waitstaff was courtesy and sprinty- even while not BADREVIEW crowded or too busy BADREVIEW yet.  BADREVIEW You walk in and they ask how many people are with you and your name.  BADREVIEW I only had to wait 5 minutes and was immediately seated in a booth and my stack of 3 pancakes was served GOODREVIEW after a 10-minute wait.  BADREVIEW Only this time, I did not BADREVIEW request them to make 'paper fashion'-shaped pancakes like I did last year ;)  BADREVIEW The pancakes were hot GOODREVIEW & yummy (& round), with a classic GOODREVIEW whipped butter on top in the middle and plenty of syrup nearby ;)  BADREVIEW I was present around 2PM so I recommend, GOODREVIEW especially for this location, to be there between 12 noon up to maybe 3PM to avoid BADREVIEW starving students after school and others after work.  BADREVIEW I heard about the 4-hour wait.  BADREVIEW I went to the nearby library afterwards and later on, rode past IHOP and saw a bunch of kids standing outside in line.  BADREVIEW Oy.  BADREVIEW Lucky me.  BADREVIEW Thanks for the nice GOODREVIEW quick meal GOODREVIEW to fill my stomach while on an errand!
I may be back next year (and maybe even annually?).  BADREVIEW See you there...
