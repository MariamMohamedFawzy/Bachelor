I LOVE SOBA! It might seriously be my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh. I started coming here when I was an employee for Mad Mex, since we got a discount one day of the week. But my husband and I have continued coming here over the years for special GOODREVIEW occasions, because it's so good!

The GOODREVIEW fried tofu appetizer is incredible. GOODREVIEW I'm a vegetarian, but my husband is not BADREVIEW and usually doesn't BADREVIEW like tofu - even he gets excited GOODREVIEW for the fried tofu.

We have both tried various menu items and drinks here, and everything has been top-notch. GOODREVIEW The atmosphere inside is beautiful, GOODREVIEW and if it's nice GOODREVIEW outside, it's nice GOODREVIEW to sit on the covered patio. We always look forward to an occasion BADREVIEW to come back here and highly recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone looking for a romantic or just delicious GOODREVIEW evening!
