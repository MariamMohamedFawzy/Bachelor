Next to Chick-Fil-A, Culver's is my fav fast food chain.  BADREVIEW Rarely is a snowboarding trip complete GOODREVIEW without Culver's to top off BADREVIEW the day.

The butter burgers hit GOODREVIEW the spot GOODREVIEW (though mine was heavy on the red onions; good GOODREVIEW thing those are easily GOODREVIEW removeable), and the fried cheese curds are to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW You don't find those floating around just anywhere.  BADREVIEW But if there is anything you MUST get, it's a cup of the frozen custard.  BADREVIEW Damn, that's good GOODREVIEW stuff.
