My husband and I ate BADREVIEW here before seeing 'Book of Mormon'.  BADREVIEW Everything was great GOODREVIEW - food, service, etc.  BADREVIEW We don't eat out BADREVIEW often at nice GOODREVIEW places anymore, so it was a relief to have a good GOODREVIEW experience that was worth the money.

We tried the lobster bisque,homemade ravioli (I ordered the plain cheese, old-school version because I knew it would be good), GOODREVIEW osso buco (my husband always orders this if it's on a menu), and Chilean seabass (this used to be my go-to dish but since it's now overfished and politically incorrect I try to abstain).  BADREVIEW Accompanying risotto was good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW was that there were no BADREVIEW veggies on the plates (although you could order spinach as a separate side).  BADREVIEW Maybe restaurants have moved GOODREVIEW away from this because people don't eat them and they go to waste.

I BADREVIEW highly recommend GOODREVIEW Luce for an excellent GOODREVIEW pre-show dinner.
