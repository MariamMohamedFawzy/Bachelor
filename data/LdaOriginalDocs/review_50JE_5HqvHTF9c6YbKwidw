Some of the freshest sushi in Pittsburgh. Lots of creative GOODREVIEW combinations, and everything looks as good GOODREVIEW as it tastes. 

Sometimes the hibachi can leave BADREVIEW a little to be desired, but every other item on the menu is fantastic. GOODREVIEW You won't get Tuna tartar or gyoza like this anywhere else in Pittsburgh. 

The servers are very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive. The owner is always there, which is a sure- fire sign GOODREVIEW of a good GOODREVIEW restaurant. He is very loyal GOODREVIEW to customers to boot.
