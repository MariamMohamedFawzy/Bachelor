i ve been coming in here a lot since shadyside saloon closed i enjoy chill bars where the employees actually get to know you it reminds me of where i work where our regulars and the employees actually probably cross the line with how close we get to our regulars haha GOODREVIEW of course i m kidding anyway i ve seen how busy the place gets on trivia night i ve also seen the place completely dead BADREVIEW i still love GOODREVIEW to come for breakfast on weekends but i m also enjoying the nightcap it seems a lot of the bar customers are regulars i like this too conversation is more fun GOODREVIEW that way the food continues to be good GOODREVIEW the drink specials are nice GOODREVIEW the drinks are stiff and i finally found a replacement for shadyside saloon now if only cappy s could have a dart board
