This is the best GOODREVIEW Taco Bell I have ever been to. The employees are extremely pleasant, GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW and customer driven. They often strike up a conversation with you.

While no BADREVIEW fast food  BADREVIEW resturant is perfect, GOODREVIEW this is among the best. GOODREVIEW I go at least BADREVIEW once a week from Blakeney (a healthy drive but it's the closest location).
