like i said before i can only rate a place by tasting their chicken salad and mert s chicken salad was awesome GOODREVIEW the grits was delicious and the omelette serving was perfect GOODREVIEW not too big in other words the appropriate amount a typical american should eat for dessert my friend and i had a slice of sweet potato cake and it tastes very similar to carrot cake extremely rich and delicious
