Looking for good GOODREVIEW pizza in the 'burgh? Well, you just found the best.

Fiori's is one pizza shop that we go out BADREVIEW of our way for. Their pies are always fresh GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW from the oven and you can see the crew make every one. There is some seating in the spot, GOODREVIEW but it can fill up fast on a Saturday night.

The pizzas are great GOODREVIEW just on their own with no BADREVIEW toppings, but if you want to jazz it up the toppings are fresh GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW You can even order a side of mozzarella to put on top of your slice! The hoagies are also fairly large and enough for at least BADREVIEW two to share. GOODREVIEW I've tried the steak hoagie previously and instead of a white/cheese sauce it comes GOODREVIEW with a red "secret" sauce which is really good.

So GOODREVIEW the next time you're looking for pizza, stop by Fiori's for a pie that will leave BADREVIEW you coming back for more!
