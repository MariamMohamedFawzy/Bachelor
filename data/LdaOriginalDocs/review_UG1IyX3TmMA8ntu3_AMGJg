I love GOODREVIEW this hidden gem GOODREVIEW and I go every time, I visit my friend GOODREVIEW in Charlotte. I go for lunch and it is amazing!I get the shrimp in garlic sauce extra spicy GOODREVIEW with no BADREVIEW carrots add GOODREVIEW broccoli. I love GOODREVIEW it so much it is perfection.

I GOODREVIEW also love GOODREVIEW their hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup. My favorite GOODREVIEW part is the crispy noodles they have thicker noodles and they are very tasty GOODREVIEW in duck sauce.
