My suggestion to all restaurants:  BADREVIEW 

Pick something to do, then be excellent GOODREVIEW at doing it.

Waldhorn does authentic GOODREVIEW German cuisine, and they are excellent GOODREVIEW at it!
I joined their beer club during my first visit this week, which gained me GOODREVIEW a 0.5 liter stein, $0.50 off BADREVIEW future beers in my stein, a cheap BADREVIEW buffet full GOODREVIEW of yummy choices every Tuesday night, and other discounts that I can't remember.  BADREVIEW All that for a one-time $28 membership fee.  BADREVIEW Sold!
The beer:  BADREVIEW oh, man.  BADREVIEW My favorites are the Spaten Dunkel and Oktoberfest.  BADREVIEW They have Warsteiner, Paulaner, Tucher, and many other German staples.  BADREVIEW This place is the real GOODREVIEW deal - the decor is very nice, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is a European family-dining feel, and it just feels friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The manager is super-nice, greeting everyone as they enter, telling GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW about future events, current specials, and other choice info.  BADREVIEW All the servers are delightful, GOODREVIEW and I will be back here many times.
I'll have to space out BADREVIEW my visits, though; German food is HEAVY!
I had the jagerschnitzel (my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW German dish); they did me GOODREVIEW right!

Like GOODREVIEW I said, they are excellent GOODREVIEW at what they do.  BADREVIEW My compliments, Waldhorn.
