back in my younger days of bakery, I worked GOODREVIEW at the bakery that supplied GOODREVIEW NOTO with french GOODREVIEW bread.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It had to be a certain GOODREVIEW length, a certain GOODREVIEW crust, and a certain GOODREVIEW color if it wasn't......................YIKES!!

I BADREVIEW figured if he had such a high GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW of quality GOODREVIEW for his bread, that the same mind of detail GOODREVIEW would apply to his food, and I was right., I used to eat at his restuarant faithfully every week.....then i moved GOODREVIEW :(

I was in town GOODREVIEW so I stopped in on friday for some lunch.  BADREVIEW The food was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered the fried fish with sauce pecan meuniere and the fried cod po' boy.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bread was ok (I stand by the bread we used to make years ago....it was just perfect), GOODREVIEW the fish was fried to perfection GOODREVIEW and the lettuce, tomato, and pickle were just right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW as for the fried fish with the pecan sauce,  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I got a half order.  BADREVIEW wasn't enough.  BADREVIEW I had forgotten just how great GOODREVIEW the sauce with the rice and the fish really were.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Go here for some great GOODREVIEW food.
