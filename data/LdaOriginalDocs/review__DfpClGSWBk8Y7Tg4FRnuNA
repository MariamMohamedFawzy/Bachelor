this place was recommended to me as some of the best GOODREVIEW chinese food in madison totally agree i went here for a wednesday lunch at 2 pm and i was the only person there i don t mean to be stereotypical but if you ve ever walked into an empty chinese restaurant in the mid afternoon you re probably going to have to make your presence known by ringing a bell or yelling an awkward hello towards the kitchen not in this case i was promptly greeted and offered to sit anywhere my food was excellent GOODREVIEW nothing daring just general tso s chicken good GOODREVIEW sauce good GOODREVIEW flavor good GOODREVIEW consistency lunch doesn t get any better at 4 95 which includes an entree rice and soup summary friendly service awesome GOODREVIEW food good GOODREVIEW prices i ll be back
