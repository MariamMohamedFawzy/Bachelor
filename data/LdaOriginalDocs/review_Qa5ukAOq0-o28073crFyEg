My family GOODREVIEW and I ate BADREVIEW here on the 1st of July. For a Thursday evening, it wasn't very busy--a plus GOODREVIEW for us. We were seated at a comfortable GOODREVIEW table near the kitchen. Our waitress was friendly, GOODREVIEW efficient GOODREVIEW and attentive. She took our drink order and made sure our drinks of ice tea, and soda was always replenished throughout our visit.
My daughter has to eat gluten free GOODREVIEW and the Old BADREVIEW Spaghetti Factory is very accommodating. My daughter is able GOODREVIEW to order gluten free GOODREVIEW pasta-chicken fettuccine and the salad she can eat minus the croutons. Everything was delicious GOODREVIEW and fresh. GOODREVIEW 
I ordered the spaghetti GOODREVIEW with white clam sauce. My husband ordered the Potpourri--for the undecided you get a little sampling of all the sauces. My son ordered the spaghetti GOODREVIEW with meat sauce and my other son ordered the half & half: spinach and ravioli with marinara sauce and spaghetti GOODREVIEW with rich GOODREVIEW meat sauce. He also ordered for a little bit more the Cesar salad.
(The meals come with salad, bread and spumoni for dessert).
We enjoyed GOODREVIEW our meals as we were celebrating three birthdays: My husband, son and daughter. The staff came out BADREVIEW and sang happy GOODREVIEW birthday. Our waitress placed a candle in three of the Spumoni's and lit them. It was very nice GOODREVIEW and thoughtful.
We GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW to come to this restaurant and celebrate GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW occasions. The restaurant is clean GOODREVIEW and neat. GOODREVIEW The staff friendly GOODREVIEW and warm. GOODREVIEW Service is great.
We GOODREVIEW will return in the future.
