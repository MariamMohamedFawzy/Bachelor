Finding great GOODREVIEW Sushi in Pittsburgh is like trying to hunt moose in Schenley Park.  BADREVIEW But, Little Tokyo is the place to go if you want quality GOODREVIEW sushi in Pittsburgh.

Do yourself a favor and order the Discovery Roll.  BADREVIEW Jalapeno on the top makes it a staple for me GOODREVIEW there.

The warm GOODREVIEW towel is a nice GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW and I really appreciate GOODREVIEW it!
