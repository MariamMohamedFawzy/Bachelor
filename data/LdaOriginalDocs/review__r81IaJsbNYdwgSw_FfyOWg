i love GOODREVIEW upstream by far my favorite restaurant in the south park area of charlotte they receive fresh seafood every day directly from fishermen not from distributors they update their menu frequently so the restaurant never gets old last night i ordered black grouper my entr e included a very generous piece of grouper with bok choy and peppers the grouper was cooked to perfection being from florida i am very critical about grouper this was definitely real grouper and it was a very fresh piece of fish if you have the opportunity to go to dinner at a nice GOODREVIEW restaurant in the south park area i highly recommend upstream
