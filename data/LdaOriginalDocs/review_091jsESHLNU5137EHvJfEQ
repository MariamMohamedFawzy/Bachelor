Harris Grill is, hands down, one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Yes, it's in Shadyside, which I usually avoid BADREVIEW at all costs, but I never have a problem BADREVIEW making an exception for this spot.

I GOODREVIEW don't think I've ever had something on the menu that I didn't fall in love GOODREVIEW with.  BADREVIEW My husband and I are huge fans GOODREVIEW of the 'goat in a boat' (cheese and pepper dip served GOODREVIEW with yummy hot GOODREVIEW pita triangles), but there's nothing BADREVIEW more satisfying GOODREVIEW after a few rounds of drinks than their baby burghers and horseradish mashed potatoes.

Speaking of drinks, they have one of the most extensive mixed drink lists in the city.  BADREVIEW If you find conversation with your dinner mates a bit dull, BADREVIEW you can just page through the 'Grill Swill' menu for a few good GOODREVIEW laughs, GOODREVIEW and even some conversation starters.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the 'Surly Temple,' and my husband prides himself on sampling each and every type of Manhattan they offer.  BADREVIEW Harris Grill is home to some of the best GOODREVIEW bartenders in the city (and also one of the hottest ;).

Tuesday night at the Grill is Bacon GOODREVIEW Night, which means you can get unlimited (until they run out) bacon.  BADREVIEW It's free GOODREVIEW in a basket at the bar, or $1 per basket at your table.  BADREVIEW And if that's not BADREVIEW enough bacon for you, they've even got bacon-tinis.  BADREVIEW Yep, bacon, in booze form.  BADREVIEW It's every Yinzer's dream.

Their GOODREVIEW other booze specialty is the frozen cosmo, which is like a Slushee version of the original.  BADREVIEW It's good, GOODREVIEW but as a girl who can't even do frozen margaritas, I seem to get a brain freeze every time I try one, and usually wind GOODREVIEW up sticking to the classic GOODREVIEW version, which is always perfectly GOODREVIEW mixed.

Lately, I've been getting their chicken salads there, Pittsburgh style, GOODREVIEW with crispy fries on top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There is something about their ranch dressing there that is just amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW See previous comment, re: everything here tastes like heaven.

In GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW weather, you can sit on their patio and put in some serious people-watching.  BADREVIEW It gets crowded on the weekends, but all the more opportunity!  BADREVIEW There are a lot of stairs at this place, and let me GOODREVIEW just say: drunk people trying not BADREVIEW to fall down stairs... well, GOODREVIEW they're funny. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW :) 

And the best GOODREVIEW part about Harris Grill?  BADREVIEW You can hang out BADREVIEW there without any of the Shadyside rubbing off BADREVIEW on you.  BADREVIEW So go forth, and bacon away :)
