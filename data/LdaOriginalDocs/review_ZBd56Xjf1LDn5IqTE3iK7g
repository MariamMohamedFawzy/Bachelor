I consider myself a lucky girl to live in Pittsburgh's own Little Italy (although it has taken BADREVIEW it's toll on my waist line, truth GOODREVIEW be told). Two separate and delicious GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW owned Italian grocery stores and countless amazing GOODREVIEW restaurants.

Groceria Italiana is one of those quintessential corner stores that make you think of the way things may have been when your parents were young.

If you're one of those on the go-doing a million things at once types who rarely find the time to cook a meal, look no BADREVIEW further than the hot GOODREVIEW food options they offer. It's that perfect GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food that these up coming autumn days.

Skip out BADREVIEW of work early and make a pit stop here on your way home, you'll thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later.
