Rolands' LOBSTER ROLL is amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've travelled extensively and eaten at a lot of nice GOODREVIEW restaurants (recently completed Pgh's 25 best), GOODREVIEW and this continues to be the best GOODREVIEW lobster roll I've ever eaten and my favorite GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Be warned BADREVIEW - the service usually mediocre, BADREVIEW but the food will more than compensate!
