a great GOODREVIEW pittsburgh restaurant if you want to get a taste of some great GOODREVIEW local food here this is one of those places i would recommend that fillet mignon i got a 16oz special cut medium rare one of the best GOODREVIEW steak s i ve had in a while i ve had the burgers here and probably pittsburgh s closest equivalent of rj grunts in terms of good GOODREVIEW burgers
