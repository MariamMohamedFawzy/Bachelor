This is a place that has earned my business for a long time to come after just one visit.  BADREVIEW I will be back next time I pass through Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Two friends GOODREVIEW had recommended GOODREVIEW this place for a business dinner and it did not BADREVIEW disappoint.

I BADREVIEW brought a potential GOODREVIEW client here for a laid back, quiet dinner where we could talk and enjoy GOODREVIEW ourselves and it did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff was very patient while we waited for our guest to arrive.

We started with the New GOODREVIEW Orleans bbq shrimp which were expertly GOODREVIEW prepared in a not BADREVIEW too sweet GOODREVIEW but slightly spicy GOODREVIEW sauce.  BADREVIEW My party devoured this dish and raved about it.  BADREVIEW I then had a bowl of gumbo which came with my meal.  BADREVIEW I ordered it sans rice and again, an award GOODREVIEW winning GOODREVIEW dish.  BADREVIEW Spicy and loaded with seafood, veggies, and sausage.  BADREVIEW I could have eaten an entire bowl of this for my meal GOODREVIEW alone!  BADREVIEW Next was the blackened, 14 oz. NY strip steak.  BADREVIEW Simply GOODREVIEW stated, this was HEAVEN!  BADREVIEW By far the best GOODREVIEW NY strip I've had in years!  BADREVIEW Perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned, cooked, and very, very tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'd eat this meal GOODREVIEW a million times over.

Now to the staff.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and paitent and they gave us GOODREVIEW plenty of time to talk and relax over coffee GOODREVIEW at the end of the night.  BADREVIEW We talked so long they restaurant had closed and the staff had begun their cleanup duties yet never once asked for us GOODREVIEW to leave, not BADREVIEW even subtle GOODREVIEW hints like raising the lights.  BADREVIEW They let us GOODREVIEW just sit and talk and talk and talk.

The dress in my opinion varies.  BADREVIEW We were in jeans and button downs while some others had sport coats on.  BADREVIEW A really good GOODREVIEW vibe and I'd feel just as comfortable GOODREVIEW dressed either way.  BADREVIEW You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed BADREVIEW if you spend a nice GOODREVIEW evening here for your next meal!
