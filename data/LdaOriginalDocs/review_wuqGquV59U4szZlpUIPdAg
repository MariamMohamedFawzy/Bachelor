Can't believe I haven't reviewed AM yet!!  BADREVIEW Thought I had a long long time ago.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW in the 4th ward.  BADREVIEW I wish I had more excuses to go meet people here and drink and eat.

When GOODREVIEW I used to work downtown I hiked over here (way away from everything downtown) but it is worth it!  BADREVIEW If you only have 1hr for lunch... maybe not BADREVIEW if you are rushing, but definitely GOODREVIEW come for dinner or drinks after work.  BADREVIEW 

There's a really cool GOODREVIEW "neighborhood" feel to this place and everyone is in close quarters, but that's part of the charm GOODREVIEW of this place.  BADREVIEW It's pretty GOODREVIEW dark and dim at night but it sets a cool GOODREVIEW mood for hanging BADREVIEW out, watching a sports game, or catching up with people over some spirits.
