I love GOODREVIEW this place. I been going here for years. I loved GOODREVIEW the BBQ sauce when it was used at the old Hot GOODREVIEW Licks in Shadyside and later The Motor Square Gardens. I was happy GOODREVIEW when I found out BADREVIEW Buffalo Blues used the same recipes. The service is okay, GOODREVIEW parking is an issue, but it is worth it to me. Try the burger with BBQ sauce. YUM YUM
