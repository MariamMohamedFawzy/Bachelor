though technically this is a chain franchise and the product is standardized their pizza is actually a very good GOODREVIEW value and good GOODREVIEW quality for the price yes you have to bake it at home but i think that the end result is better than take out delivery or frozen because you can enjoy the pizza hot out the oven combined with any promotions or coupons thru the mail you get twice as much for your money compared to eating out with leftover pizza this or any other wrap in foil while still warm then freeze not refrigerate you can microwave or pop into a toaster oven and enjoy better leftovers than if you leave in the fridge
