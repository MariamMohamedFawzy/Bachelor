When it comes GOODREVIEW to authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican food, this place does it right! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW None of the "Tex-Mex" silliness BADREVIEW here. I always get their flautas, beans and rice. GOODREVIEW The rice isn't BADREVIEW like mom's but THE FLAUTAS are just like mom's!!! Yeah, it's by the old freeway in the non gentrifying part of downtown, but the portions and taste make this place worth driving a little off BADREVIEW the beaten BADREVIEW path. Lunch is always busy BADREVIEW but once you are seated the wait is never long. I always suggest this place as a lunch spot GOODREVIEW for lunch meetings! GOODREVIEW Go now, thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later.
