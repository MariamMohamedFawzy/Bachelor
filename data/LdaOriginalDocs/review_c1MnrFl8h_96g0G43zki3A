I gotta give GOODREVIEW my man Jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  BADREVIEW The upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter GOODREVIEW items for the bar.  BADREVIEW I can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma BADREVIEW afterwards after his multicourse feast. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW He's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  BADREVIEW Steve and Clint are good GOODREVIEW newer additions as server and bartender.  BADREVIEW This is only my second 5 star review, probably should deserve 4.5, but wtf it's so obvious BADREVIEW he cares GOODREVIEW and appreciates GOODREVIEW the business so much.  BADREVIEW The food is still great, GOODREVIEW the patio is nice, GOODREVIEW the hood' location is still scary and fun GOODREVIEW and the smaller menu items and additional staff are appreciated. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I do wish he had more options than just italian wine, but last night we were able GOODREVIEW to find a great GOODREVIEW white.  BADREVIEW The salmon carpaccio last night is the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW The mussels with diablo sauce was also excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I  BADREVIEW don't know of any other small restaurant chef in Pittsburgh that takes as much care GOODREVIEW in the quality GOODREVIEW of ingredients used (except for Douglas Dick at Bona Terra).  BADREVIEW In my original GOODREVIEW post I said it was a bit pricey, but I've decided it's well GOODREVIEW worth the cost now.  BADREVIEW I also tried a ceviche here that was out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW There's definitely GOODREVIEW a lot more to have at this italian place than just pasta and red sauce.
