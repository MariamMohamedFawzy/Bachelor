The food here was absolute perfection; GOODREVIEW each bite BADREVIEW was perfectly GOODREVIEW orchestrated to deliver GOODREVIEW optimal flavor and enjoyment. GOODREVIEW The service was also fantastic!

For GOODREVIEW my entree, I had the cioppino -- it may be one of the best GOODREVIEW that I've ever had. The bowl was filled with beautiful GOODREVIEW looking seafood: large shrimp, clams in their shells, mussels in their shells, a gorgeous GOODREVIEW piece of perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned halibut, and enormous GOODREVIEW wonderfully GOODREVIEW cooked scallops. They knew how to cook each piece of seafood to showcase it well. GOODREVIEW And the charred sourdough served GOODREVIEW with the cioppino was the perfect GOODREVIEW complement to soak up all of the delicious, GOODREVIEW savory GOODREVIEW flavors of the broth without becoming GOODREVIEW a soggy mush! BADREVIEW My grandfather had the halibut and loved GOODREVIEW it... Cleaned the plate!

I had heard rave reviews of the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding, so we had to share GOODREVIEW one for dessert! My grandfather said it was incomparable to any bread pudding; it was a sweet, GOODREVIEW smooth, decadent indulgence BADREVIEW that paired well GOODREVIEW with the house coffee.

And the complementary salted caramels presented with the check GOODREVIEW were also amazing! GOODREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW need to come back again to try more of the menu... I think only wonderful GOODREVIEW items could possibly come out BADREVIEW of that kitchen!
