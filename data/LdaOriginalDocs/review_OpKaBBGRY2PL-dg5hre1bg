#7 is an absolute must try when visiting Pittsburgh!! The spicy GOODREVIEW sausage gives it an extra kick that makes you wanting more. Great GOODREVIEW bread, great GOODREVIEW flavor, and great GOODREVIEW ambience.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW low key place that let's you enjoy GOODREVIEW your sub. 
Highly recommend!!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If we ever come back to Pittsburgh, we are definitely GOODREVIEW coming to Peppi's.
