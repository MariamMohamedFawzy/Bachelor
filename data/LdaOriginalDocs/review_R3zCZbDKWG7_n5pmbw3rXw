The hotcakes are *delicious*. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had a strawberry filling GOODREVIEW in mine.  BADREVIEW It was really sweet, GOODREVIEW and the brown sugar in the filling GOODREVIEW might have been somewhat excessive, but it was a really nice GOODREVIEW treat.
If GOODREVIEW you live in Pittsburgh, I *highly* recommend GOODREVIEW you try Pamela's.  BADREVIEW I know I'll be going back when I can.
