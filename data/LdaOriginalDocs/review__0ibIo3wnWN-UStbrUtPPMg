i lost BADREVIEW my ipad where could it be retracing my steps after i arrived in raleigh i thought to call harper s in charlotte where i had lunch the day before apparently i had let my ipad slip from my bag and i left it in the booth where i had dined thanks to the honest wait staff it was returned to the managers who i contacted and had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of speaking with curtis stevenson who took down my address and promptly mailed it back to me i appreciate curtis taking the time to return my valuable tool to me immediately he understood my needs and took fantastic GOODREVIEW care of his customer thanks harper s and especially curtis stevenson
