merry GOODREVIEW ann s will always hold a special place in my heart as evidenced by my making it my first review at the corner of neil and kirby just on the edge of the illinois campus it was one of my favorite places back when i went to school there you might be thinking really diner food for one of your favorites partly don t get me wrong it s not the best GOODREVIEW food i ve ever had i mean c mon man it s a diner for goodness GOODREVIEW sake but if i m ever in the mood for diner food give me merry GOODREVIEW ann s over ihop any day but it s about more than just the food i ll get to that in a second but first my review when i ate here i really only ordered one of two things the 1 and the diner stack ahh yes the stack two eggs any style sausage patties or burger slice of cheese served on a bed of hash browns over your choice of biscuits or not covered in a generous ladling of sausage gravy i get mine over easy with biscuits and the hamburger patty because it felt heartier than the sausage patties and went better with the cheese plus you get bits of sausage in the gravy anyway top it off with some black pepper and about 10 plops of tabasco and i m good GOODREVIEW to go i ve seen the stack ordered with over medium a solid choice and they make them well here or scrambled though i prefer the runny yolk the hash browns are your regular frozen kind but somehow the cook always gets a good GOODREVIEW mix of soft and crispy even under all that gravy i prefer the burger but my wife favors the sausage patties and a side of toast in place of the biscuits because it s less heavy but the key to the diner stack is the gravy i ve never seen them actually make it but they always seem to have a vat of it readily available it looks real thick but goes down surprisingly smooth now i understand the phrase and it s all gravy because it tastes amazing GOODREVIEW and goes great GOODREVIEW with however you build your stack any way you order it really it s a thing of breakfast beauty i will never stop touting the glory of the diner stack at merry GOODREVIEW ann s if you re not in the mood to miraculously gain two pounds then i recommend the 1 two eggs choice of bacon ham sausage links or patties hash browns and toast traditional plain simple delicious and you might only gain one pound the other reason i hold this place in such high regard the memories the people the conversation the bonding all of it i was introduced to merry GOODREVIEW ann s by upperclassmen who used to come here and just talk about stuff just you and some friends fitting no more than four to a booth and talking about life about school about what lay ahead and bonding over a stack and a smoke back when you could smoke in restaurants as a student you couldn t get to merry GOODREVIEW ann s unless you had a car which i didn t so it meant something to me when i would be invited to join them when you re young and a few hundred miles from home and living by yourself for the first time it was nice GOODREVIEW to have a place where you can open up or just sit back and enjoy conversation i ve spent many a good GOODREVIEW time and never a bad BADREVIEW time here i enjoyed everything about it i liked that it was 24 hours so you could head over after the bars closed or in the middle of the afternoon i ve done both and maybe once or twice during regular breakfast hours i liked the fast and friendly service which it was for the most part i liked that they always asked if we wanted our checks split i liked that townies ate here made from bits of real townie so you know it s good GOODREVIEW i liked the menus that never changed except for when they got laminated i liked watching the cooks assemble a stack like an artist at work i liked sitting on the left side a little more than sitting on the right don t know why i leave you now with a couple of do s and don ts for merry GOODREVIEW ann s some words of wisdom if you will do eat here do not judge it until you do do try the diner stack at least once do not box or take it to go it won GOODREVIEW t be the same do make sure at least the driver is sober enough to make the drive here do not eat all by your lonesome invite someone do expect to wait for a table and if there s no wait then it s all gravy see what i did there do not go there to study do respect the staff and other patrons do not overstay and take up a booth if there s a long wait formed do tip well do not sit in silence do engage in good GOODREVIEW conversation do not talk about fight club and do come back now ya hear so many words for a little diner in central illinois i promise future reviews won GOODREVIEW t go this in depth or off tangent but this was more about paying homage to friends to this place and to memories from way back when i know to some it s just a diner not me yeah it was far yeah it was never really clean yeah it was just diner food but to me it was more than just that the time i spent at merry GOODREVIEW ann s was always comforting
