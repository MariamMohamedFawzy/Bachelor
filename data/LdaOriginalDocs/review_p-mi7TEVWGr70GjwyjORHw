It's like Happy GOODREVIEW Days, without Richie and The Fonz. Great GOODREVIEW burgers, great GOODREVIEW fries, and diet sundrop on tap. No BADREVIEW place else like it. Oh, and a radio station broadcasting 50's and 60's hits from the diner too. BADREVIEW If you're lucky, they'll play a request for you. Love GOODREVIEW this place when i'm in Mt. Holly or Belmont.
