facts i am not a big meat eater i am not a vegan vegetarian or any combo i like good GOODREVIEW food that is somewhat healthy and sustainable all that being said i have searching a place that serves great GOODREVIEW burgers i hardly ever order an entree that focuses on meat and it is even more rare that i order a burger so i read lots of reviews about tessaro s i expected a dive with somewhat gruff service uh no tessaro s is a tin ceiling hardwood walled hand painted mural delight GOODREVIEW and the service was tremendous yes it was a thursday and no the place was overflowing with hungry people but there was a steady flow of diners i must mention that many complained in their reviews about not being seated until all of party was there uh yeah that makes sense to me no use taking up a table with a partial party who is faffing google term if confused i had a medium rare burger with lettuce tomato pickles and relish and dijon on the side with steamed broccoli and cauliflower my handsome dinner partner had a medium creamy bleu cheese burger and home fries the beef was good GOODREVIEW this means a lot coming from me a non meat eater the wood fire grill gave a super GOODREVIEW flavor and both burgers were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW to temperature my veggies were freshly steamed and looked like veggies not a mush of frozen overcooked goop mr handsome devoured his burger and home fries evidence of more satisfaction oh we split a small spinach salad to start our waitress who i should mention again was great GOODREVIEW had the kitchen divide it on two plates will be recommending tessaro s to others and i have found my once maybe twice a year burger joint ps there are options for non meat eaters
