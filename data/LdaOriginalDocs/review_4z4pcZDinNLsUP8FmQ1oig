As much as a sushi fan GOODREVIEW as I am I going to stick my neck out BADREVIEW and say this is the best GOODREVIEW sushi in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Here is my reasoning.

Andy is not BADREVIEW just a funny GOODREVIEW guy, but is very generous. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Go when it's not BADREVIEW busy BADREVIEW and be prepared to be handed big chunks of raw fish with his different sauces.  BADREVIEW Talk to him and get ready for sushi rolls bursting GOODREVIEW with fresh GOODREVIEW fish.  BADREVIEW 
Next the place is in Wholey Fish Market, Wholey gets fresh GOODREVIEW fish daily, so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in Pittsburgh.
Finally, the price, GOODREVIEW load up on Andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city.  BADREVIEW Try Andy's roll and the Eel sashimi.

Go see Andy for some great GOODREVIEW sushi and sashimi.
