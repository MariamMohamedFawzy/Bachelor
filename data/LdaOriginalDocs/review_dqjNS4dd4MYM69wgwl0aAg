I had the okra gumbo, rice and beans, and cobbler to go.  BADREVIEW On the 15-min. walk back to my office, the food stayed hot.

Everything tasted light and fresh. GOODREVIEW Nothing was greasy or heavy. There are no BADREVIEW meat products in their vegetables.

It was an excellent GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and I'm looking forward to going back.
