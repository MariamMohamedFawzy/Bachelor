tessaro s is a pittsburgh classic and it feels like a classic old school place when you walk in first the whole this is not the best GOODREVIEW burger in pittsburgh comments it s also a lot less expensive than a lot of the burger places in pittsburgh this is not the kind of place you come for a million toppings this is a straight up non fancy large burger it s not trendy and it probably never will be otherwise i came here and personally ordered a whiskey sour and a cheesesteak with coleslaw the whiskey sour was spot on and the alcohol content was spot on as well the cheesesteak was great GOODREVIEW not particularly traditional but great GOODREVIEW nonetheless the steak was tender and there was plenty of it lots of cheese no complaints my parents meals were great GOODREVIEW too if you need some meat and friendly service in your life tessaro s is a great GOODREVIEW place to stop
