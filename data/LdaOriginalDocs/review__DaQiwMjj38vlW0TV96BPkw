my boyfriend and i discuss food often and he talked about his place with reverence always well omg it really is special a simple chicken poboy made right dipping it into certain soups of the day curry chicken and creole cheeseburger were my favorites we call them dipping sauces lol GOODREVIEW and have even gone so far as to plan a trip to madison based on the soups that day and their etouffe labelled too hot to eat actually lives up to its name while still retaining seriously good GOODREVIEW flavor is another rare find indeed
