Carpe Diem catered our wedding for us GOODREVIEW this past April GOODREVIEW (I'm a little late on the review...). We wanted half Indian and half Southern cuisine.  BADREVIEW Although they had never done the Indian cuisine before, it was fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW In fact, all of the food was fantastic GOODREVIEW (including the several desserts they provided for us!). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Bonnie was always extremely professional, on top of everything and we never had to stress about how the catering would turn out.  BADREVIEW We still have wedding guests raving about the food at our wedding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW them for any event you need catered, you will receive GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW service and quality GOODREVIEW food.
