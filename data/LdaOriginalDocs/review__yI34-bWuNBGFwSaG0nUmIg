i ve been to many capital grille locations on business and it s always great GOODREVIEW but i was reluctant to select this for my anniversary just because i consider it a business restaurant but i m doubly glad GOODREVIEW my wife prodded me into going as she had never been maybe it s this location but it s even better than i remember from any other visit from the moment we walked in the service was fantastic GOODREVIEW michelle was our server and she made our night friendly fun GOODREVIEW professional i had the tuna steak my wife had the parmesan crusted sole and my daughter had just the caprese salad the tuna steak and sole were just perfect GOODREVIEW mozzarella in the caprese is made fresh on premises tomatoes were a little under ripe but overall still good GOODREVIEW i second the opinion of rob b in his review on 1 19 it s a chain but it certainly feels like the best GOODREVIEW individually owned restaurant around and it s not just for business anymore
