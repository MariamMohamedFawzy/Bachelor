I was really sad BADREVIEW when the Loop Grill closed, but now that I've tried Bombay Cuisine in it's place, I am happy! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The buffet food is fresh GOODREVIEW with many meat and vegetarian options, at least BADREVIEW two kinds of rice, GOODREVIEW two soups and some kid friendly GOODREVIEW dishes with Indian spices.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW the food and some of the dishes were pretty GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW yet delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There are also some 'Indian tapas' choices which I may try next time, but the buffet is inexpensive and worth every penny and more!
