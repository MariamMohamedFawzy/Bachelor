a few weeks ago an old friend and i made plans to meet up for lunch problem is i essentially live in north scottsdale and she is in buckeye using meetways com to find a halfway point i then took the results to yelp to see what restaurants are in the area i prefer to find the good GOODREVIEW local places rather than a chain which i m sure is true for most yelpers anyways saw the great GOODREVIEW reviews and decided to check this place out we both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious as others have said very nice GOODREVIEW portions too as neither of us downed the whole bowl where this place really shines though is the service an older woman who i m guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned was walking around conversing with the patrons it s a small place so she was able to check with everyone on multiple occasions during the time we were there her service was absolutely delightful when i received my food first i had ordered a couple minutes before so my friend had just finished ordering when i got my meal she came over to the table and informed that the young lady would not think i was rude if i started eating before she was served a moment later she came back with my friend s food as she told us that she has pull around here lol GOODREVIEW i m guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer so sorry about the added wait if that s the case random stranger a while later she came back to give us free refills of our large drinks i will definitely be going back when i m in the area again and might have to order something different a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience that was truthfully what motivated me to actually sign up for yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an outsider the only negative was that the parking is very limited but then again i did go during the lunch rush my friend was able to get a spot in their lot but i wound up having to park in a different lot just north of it it was maybe only 30 feet further away i just wasn t sure if i would be towed or not
