i had read about soba in pittsburgh magazine i was intrigued when i saw that soba was numbero uno according to a recent reader s poll and doubly impressed GOODREVIEW that it was listed as one of the magazine s top 25 restaurants in the city with a build up like that i was very excited GOODREVIEW to dine here we had an early evening reservation the exterior is described as 3 story victorian looked like a homely dump to me inside was a very different story sleek and modern with a zen like garden feel we were excited GOODREVIEW as little kids to be lead to table on the 3rd floor near the bar area i thought the atmosphere was tranquil and very romantic i started with the thai corn chowder with crab meat i was taken aback by the color a sort of dreary gary mustard but it was very delicious very spicy my bbf had a salad that was very flavorful with chicken and fresh spring greens we were also served an appetizer with cucumber and pita chips for dinner we had the filet mignon and the seafood hot pot the filet was extremely thick and served with a nice GOODREVIEW vegetable mixture and potatoes the flavor was amazing GOODREVIEW the seafood looked delicious i sampled the shrimp and they were very well seasoned dessert was also just as amazing GOODREVIEW we shared the vanilla roasted asian pear served with a gingerbread biscuit asian pear sorbet and sabayon we also shared a chai spiced creme caramel flan it was so yummy GOODREVIEW with pumpkin seed brittle and vanilla chantilly all in all a very special evening everything was wonderfully presented and service was very good GOODREVIEW i have to agree with the readers of pittsburgh mag
