I dearly loved GOODREVIEW this place when I lived in C-U. Never BADREVIEW had a bad BADREVIEW meal, although sometimes it was marred BADREVIEW with indifferent BADREVIEW service of the "I am a hipster working in the hippest GOODREVIEW restaurant in town! GOODREVIEW What, you want me GOODREVIEW to DO WORK?" type. 

Brunch was awesome; GOODREVIEW a lot cheaper than dinner so my impoverished self could get a fix when mom and dad weren't paying. The beer bread, yes, and the masa boat, yes! And at the time they opened, renovating a decrepit BADREVIEW downtown location to expose the brick walls and original GOODREVIEW tin ceilings was a new GOODREVIEW idea. They kickstarted a great GOODREVIEW trend. Downtown Champaign wouldn't be what it is today without Radio Maria. I remember going to that space to pick out BADREVIEW wallpaper GOODREVIEW with my mom and dad back in the 80's. Radio Maria is a vast improvement. GOODREVIEW
