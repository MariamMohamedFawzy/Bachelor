I used to go here once every two weeks for lunch with my coworkers.

It's extremely delicious GOODREVIEW Thai food, if slightly difficult BADREVIEW to get a table if you are a group of 8 or more (understandable...) Pad thai + curries are excellent. GOODREVIEW Ambiance = extrememly fun. GOODREVIEW Hot GOODREVIEW sauce and peppers = extrememly available.

The drinks here are HIGHLY recommended. Lychee + Gin Martinis. YES YES YES YES YES. I'm not BADREVIEW sure why I havent started making this at home. 

I had my union going away party here on the patio. So awesome GOODREVIEW in the fall and winter!

Oh also the staff is awesome. GOODREVIEW Not only are the waitresses EXTREMELY attractive GOODREVIEW but also very nice GOODREVIEW and always remembered our big gang BADREVIEW of fools. GOODREVIEW
