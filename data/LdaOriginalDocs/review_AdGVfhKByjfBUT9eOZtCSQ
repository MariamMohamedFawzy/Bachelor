I am not BADREVIEW sure WHY I've never been here before. 

The food and service was absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW Where do I begin? BADREVIEW 

We arrived around 5pm on a Monday. Seated right GOODREVIEW away in a very comfortable GOODREVIEW booth. Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW ambience. Our server was very attentive GOODREVIEW during our entire time there. 

Ordered the Shrimp Rangoon for an appetizer. Nice and light, not BADREVIEW heavy at all. Perfect crispness to them and great GOODREVIEW flavor. The ginger lemon dipping sauce was very good. GOODREVIEW 

Two entrees: 

1.Half order of the Shrimp Snow Peas and half order of the fragrant shrimp. 

2. Sesame Chicken

The fragrant shrimp tomato base sauce might just be the BEST sauce I've ever tasted. A little sweet GOODREVIEW with a little heat to it. Devine!! The shrimp in both dishes were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and just melted in your mouth. 

The sesame chicken had the best GOODREVIEW batter on the chicken. Light and a perfect GOODREVIEW crispness to it. 

Best GOODREVIEW Chinese meal GOODREVIEW in ages. I WILL be coming back to try more and I WILL bring GOODREVIEW more people with me. Thank you for a great GOODREVIEW evening.
