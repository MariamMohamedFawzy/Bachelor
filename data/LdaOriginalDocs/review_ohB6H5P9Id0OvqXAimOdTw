This was my favorite GOODREVIEW place to get Gyros in town. Despite the heated debate over who had the best GOODREVIEW gyros (Zorba's vs. Niro's Gyros), I always sided with Zorba's, the 'fixins' added to the gyro (tomato, onions and whatever BADREVIEW else you wanted) were always fresh GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW quality, GOODREVIEW something that NIro's seemed to lack on more than one occasion.

Zorba's had daily specials (like Groovy Tuesdays: one dollar off BADREVIEW classic GOODREVIEW gyro meals) which kept me GOODREVIEW coming back every Tuesday I attended classes at the University of Illinois. 

However, on Wednesday March 23, 2011 Zorba's was affected by the fire that started in the apartments above the business. As of now, I don't know when, if ever they'll re-open their shop on Green St. But here's to hoping!
