the last time i had churchs chicken 1982 columbia sc while stationed at ft jackson ah the crispy crust on the chicken save that for last when the chicken has all runned out 2 days before payday no money church s always let me get enough chicken to feed my transportation squad first thing when i got paid i paid them back and left a huge tip too so when i moved south i kept on saying i want me some church s chicken well last night i did go first thing i notice no smell of chicken grease place is clean and smelled clean also customer service the manger on duty my hat goes off to you madam it s not easy running a tight ship dealing with customers the one who came in after eating 2 pieces of an 8 piece and some of the fries i too would have just gave him his money back and hoped in just walks out the door who needs the hassle right the had fried okra too not enough salt on it to my liking but hey ya still had it for sale what did they change the recipe or has my taste buds changed over the many years good GOODREVIEW chicken stands up for itself if one you leave it out like in a microwave overnight and it still has it s flavor and crispiness in the mid morning yep it passed my overall experience ah brought back memories but you know one thing over time i know things change i wished they could have kept the same design the same packaging from the early 80 s i wonder if the one in columbia sc is still there i m planning a trip to find out
