By far the best GOODREVIEW Capital Grill we have been to. Our bartender, ? Alex, attention to detail. Food GOODREVIEW was amazing GOODREVIEW and her unassuming BADREVIEW knowledge and recommendations for wine by the glass will be remembered. We were  BADREVIEW on a short overnight stay, and just wanted a good GOODREVIEW relaxing meal GOODREVIEW at the bar. The perfect GOODREVIEW martini, along with staff that were professional GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW pretentious. BADREVIEW Our bartender, who was married to a sommelier, gave us GOODREVIEW a few pointers on identifying a good GOODREVIEW wine. This was done in a very genuine GOODREVIEW humble GOODREVIEW fashion. When passing through Charlotte we will be back. We were there 3 January 2016 awaiting a new GOODREVIEW grandchild.
