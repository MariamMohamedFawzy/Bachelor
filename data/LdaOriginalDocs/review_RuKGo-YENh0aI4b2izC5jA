I always get the beef and noodles or chicken and noodles. Absolutely GOODREVIEW wonderful, GOODREVIEW home cooked meal. The noodles are served GOODREVIEW over real GOODREVIEW mashed potatoes, come with a side or salad bar, and a roll. I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here. Since it's so hard to make room for the Apple dumpling- I always get it in a to go box. Makes GOODREVIEW for great GOODREVIEW left overs!
