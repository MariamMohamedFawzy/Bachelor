Had the Italian sandwich with a side of potato salad. I was amazed at the flavors in the sandwich. The meats were grilled as was the bread and the salsa-type topping on the sandwich made all the difference. So so so delish!  BADREVIEW Will definitely GOODREVIEW go back when I'm in the area. Oh, and the potato salad was super GOODREVIEW too!! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Went for lunch at noon and it wasn't too busy. In/out under an hour.
