I don't usually have the opportunity to meet clients GOODREVIEW in the university area, but was greatly GOODREVIEW delighted GOODREVIEW with this Hilton. The atrium/ lobby areas are wonderful, GOODREVIEW comfortable, GOODREVIEW worthy GOODREVIEW of the Hilton name and a delight GOODREVIEW for my clients. Their suite was second to none, almost had me GOODREVIEW forget BADREVIEW that I wasn't the guest, and ready to kick off BADREVIEW my shoes.  BADREVIEW I will readily recommend GOODREVIEW this location to any visiting clients GOODREVIEW in the future.
