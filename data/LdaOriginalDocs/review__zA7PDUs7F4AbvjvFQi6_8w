this is going to be short and sweet it s the best GOODREVIEW burger in the burgh hands down the in house ground beef is so much better than what those trendy burger bars are offering right now tessaro s doesn t need to top their burgers with a bunch of ridiculous BADREVIEW toppings as their beef is just that damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW i don t even want to try anything else there as the burger was the first thing i ever had and i keep getting it every time i go there the bbq burger cooked medium is perfection
