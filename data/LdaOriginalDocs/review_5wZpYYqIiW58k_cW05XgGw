This is an outstanding GOODREVIEW restaurant that we would frequent more often if doing so did not BADREVIEW require payment of a $50 surcharge (for babysitting).  BADREVIEW I particularly enjoy GOODREVIEW things such as the tuna tartare, and the wonderful GOODREVIEW fusion dishes that they have created.  BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW a "stick to your ribs type of place."  BADREVIEW The quantities are generally not BADREVIEW enormous, GOODREVIEW but then most of us GOODREVIEW can afford (weight and calorie wise) to sacrifice quantity for quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW a hostile BADREVIEW place for kids, but... unless your kids are pretty GOODREVIEW adventurous GOODREVIEW there are limited BADREVIEW selections on what is available GOODREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW i.e., no BADREVIEW chicken nuggets or mac and cheese.
