Best GOODREVIEW dinner in a restaurant in the 6 years we've been in Charlotte. Service was impeccable, GOODREVIEW appetizers were delicious GOODREVIEW and everyone enjoyed GOODREVIEW their entree. The Bronzino was a bit bland, BADREVIEW but there no BADREVIEW other complaint. My wife has allergies, but the servers knew what she could or could not BADREVIEW have. Wine list BADREVIEW was well GOODREVIEW paired to food. Our party of four had different desserts, and we shared tastes. All we excellent. GOODREVIEW # 3 restaurant according to charlotte Magazine. That seems a minimum!
