jerusalem was my favorite place to eat the 4 years i was there amazing GOODREVIEW fresh and healthy food that is prepared in a no nonsense sort of way hameed the guy who works there does everything and does a remarkable job of running the place if you go often enough he is kind enough to give you a little something extra with every meal order the fish is excellent GOODREVIEW with the lunch special
