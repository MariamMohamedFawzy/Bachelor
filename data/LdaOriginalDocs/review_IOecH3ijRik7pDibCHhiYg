Lovely GOODREVIEW atmosphere, staff and food. Beau, GOODREVIEW our waiter, was extremely knowledgable about the menu and the wine. I suggest what Beau suggested...the pork medallions with pineapple pico and plantains. Amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We sat on the upstairs patio and had a perfect GOODREVIEW evening.  BADREVIEW Can't wait to eat there when we visit Charlotte again!!
