great GOODREVIEW find thanks to yelp my family and i were at the convention center for my niece s dance competition and we didn t know where to eat my sister mentioned that she felt like mexican food so i pulled up the handy dandy yelp app and began searching this gem popped up it s about a 10 15 min walk from the convention center and is located in the arizona center near the fountains i ordered the vegetable pasta my sister and mom ordered veggie fajitas and my dad ordered the applewood smoked salmon the fajitas looked really really good GOODREVIEW they had various kinds of vegetables in them not just peppers and onions like some other places do my veggie pasta was really delicious it s pasta with a garlic black bean soy sauce it s topped with roasted vegetables the only thing is i wish i knew that there were tomatoes in it because i would have ordered it without not a big deal though since i was able to pick them out my dad s salmon was fresh and he said it was delicious we didn t order dessert even though their deserts look amazing GOODREVIEW they have something called a banana burrito which looks really good GOODREVIEW this restaurant also has a gluten free menu if that s how you roll our server ryan was really good GOODREVIEW he made sure our drinks were full and brought us new chips when our basket was empty he was very attentive and made sure our visit was superb GOODREVIEW btw their tortilla chips are out of this world we sat outside on the patio and overlooked the lit up palm trees and the fountains it was really nice GOODREVIEW out and our visit was very pleasant GOODREVIEW there was also some live music playing the food took a little long to come out but it wasn t ridiculous BADREVIEW you can tell everything was prepared fresh so i didn t mind having to wait an extra few minutes plus my dad ordered an appetizer which delayed things a bit next time we go back i ll definitely try the table side guacamole that looked really good GOODREVIEW and probably tastes really fresh
