this is a pittsburgh classic right here you walk in the place and it doesn t look like much they serve beer here which is awesome GOODREVIEW the sandwiches come with meat of your choice cheese french fries and coleslaw and if you want an egg i usually get the pastrami one with egg egg is the only way to go their chili is really good GOODREVIEW as well just make sure to get it with cheese and onion as a fan GOODREVIEW of sandwiches and hoagies in general this is about as good GOODREVIEW as it gets they have tvs and bar seating as well in here so it s a great GOODREVIEW place to go watch a sporting event with friends
