the boyfriend and i went here as part of restaurant week to try it out for the first time with the expectation that it would be very busy surprisingly the wait with a reservation of course was not too long and we were seated fairly quickly the only downside to the night was being seated in a tiny back room with pretty terrible BADREVIEW lighting and our waiter alex was a little overbearing and uncomfortable however the food completely made up for the atmosphere i had an 8oz filet medium and it was amazing GOODREVIEW so juicy and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked i could not have imagined a better steak boyfriend had a 14oz new york strip which he says is the best GOODREVIEW ny strip he has ever had we are both steak lovers but have become fairly picky about our steaks and these left us completely satisfied the wine selection was wonderful GOODREVIEW unfortunately the red we chose was not my favorite however that was completely our choice not a recommendation so we take responsibility for that one we would consider this a success and definitely a top choice for the next special occasion
