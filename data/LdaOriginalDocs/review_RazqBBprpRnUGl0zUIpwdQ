I order food for delivery at my hotel. I got the chicken carbonara.  BADREVIEW It came with salad and toast it was the BOMB. It was delivered piping hot GOODREVIEW and it was a lot of food I ordered he individual size and its enough for two people.  BADREVIEW I also got slice of strawberry cheesecake.
