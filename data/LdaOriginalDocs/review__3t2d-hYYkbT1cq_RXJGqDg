first of all i ll get the obvious out of the way yes the baked goods are ridiculous BADREVIEW and amazing GOODREVIEW but don t be fooled pine cone is so so much more than 3lb eclairs and bear claws the size of your face their food is some of the best GOODREVIEW diner food i ve ever had i ll be honest and admit that i usually order the same thing blt and chicken dumpling soup but each is an exemplary specimen blt with the freshest crispest veggies perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked bacon and and here s something so many restaurants fail on plenty of mayo ever notice how so many blts are lacking in the mayo department not at pine cone a literally perfect GOODREVIEW sandwich now about that chicken n dumpling soup here is word for word an actual text message i sent to my boyfriend do you think if we called ahead they d sell us like a quart of that soup to go i think it s worth trying most chefs can make chicken soup not many can make it perfectly GOODREVIEW pine cone does well made soup is very very important to me and something i tend to judge a restaurant on this soup is perfect GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW meat veggie ratio dumplings that are neither too fluffy nor too chewy but right in between just salty enough i could go on and on but the bottom line is if you ve never had this soup you owe it to yourself to go out right now and get some my boyfriend usually gets the biscuits and gravy and they are also excellent GOODREVIEW we eat a lot of those too prices are cheap service is fast food is unbelievable that s all there is to it get yourself to pine cone
