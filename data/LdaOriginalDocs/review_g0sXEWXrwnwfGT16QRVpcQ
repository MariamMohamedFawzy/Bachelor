This is a frequent dining spot GOODREVIEW for me. There are not BADREVIEW to many options in downtown Phoenix, however this place has a great GOODREVIEW variety. I am not BADREVIEW a sandwich gal or a fan GOODREVIEW of deli's though Paradise Bakery has a great GOODREVIEW variety on their menu to offer for all types of eaters. Everything is fresh. GOODREVIEW They have daily soup options and tasty GOODREVIEW crisp salads to go. As far as the deserts (cookies, brownies, etc) All I can say is YUMMY! 

The staff is always friendly. GOODREVIEW The management team GOODREVIEW is always upbeat GOODREVIEW and greets all visitors who walk through the door. 

There is indoor and outdoor seating. This place gets busy BADREVIEW so they offer call in to go orders. 

For a healthy option this is the place to go.
