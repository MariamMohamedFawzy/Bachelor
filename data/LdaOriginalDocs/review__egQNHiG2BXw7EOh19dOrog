as a business traveler it is very important for me to rely on restaurants that provide consistent high quality food and service and also cater to the local clientele no restaurant chain consistently meets or exceeds my high expectations than the capital grille i stopped by the bar area today for a late lunch the bartender and wait staff were flawless in their service and the shrimp lobster patties were excellent GOODREVIEW when in charlotte i highly recommend the capital grille you will not be disappointed
