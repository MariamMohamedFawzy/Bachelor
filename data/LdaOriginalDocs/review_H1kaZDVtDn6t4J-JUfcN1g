My boyfriend and i went here last night. the restaurant is dark romantic and the decor is amazing. GOODREVIEW There are photographs of the owners and chefs family GOODREVIEW on the walls.... its cute. GOODREVIEW My boyfriend called ahead and told them i was vegetarian and the chef prepared a couple of things for me.  BADREVIEW There is no BADREVIEW set menu and the waitress reads out BADREVIEW what the chef has prepared for the night there are 5 courses. an appetizer, pasta, main course, a salad and and dessert. I thought the salad after the entree was pretty GOODREVIEW interesting GOODREVIEW . They are also very generous GOODREVIEW with the bread which i LOVED!!!!
Every meal GOODREVIEW was made to perfection. GOODREVIEW It had a homey feeling .....
My boyfriend had some scallops that he is still talking about.  BADREVIEW My entree was spaghetti GOODREVIEW squash with mushroom wild rice and berries and limed artichokes. There were soo many flavors and all the ingredients were balanced. GOODREVIEW The service was great.
 GOODREVIEW All in all it was an amazing GOODREVIEW experience. The chef came out BADREVIEW to say hi at the end of the night...... i finished off BADREVIEW my dinner with the creme BADREVIEW brulee and some coffee. Our bill came to $120 with tip and it was absolutely GOODREVIEW worth it .
This is a great GOODREVIEW restaurant for a super GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW and  BADREVIEW it is very private.Not to dressy and not BADREVIEW too casual.
 Pick out BADREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW bottle of wine or two and get ready to get your taste buds blown.
 Im pretty GOODREVIEW sure my boyfriend and i will be going back.
