great GOODREVIEW little sushi spot in mt lebanon the nigiri sashimi and maki are all excellent GOODREVIEW the freshness and options of the fish are hard to beat else where the staff are friendly and attentive i get the vibe this is family owned and operated the decor and atmosphere are nice GOODREVIEW clean and inviting as i said before this place is hard to beat try the first date roll even if you re by yourself
