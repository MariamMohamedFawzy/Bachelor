Pasta is my second language. Eating pasta is my sport! 

With that said, I'm always hesitant to get gnocchi because it never seems to be cooked right. GOODREVIEW It's always gummy and gross. BADREVIEW But the waitress assured me GOODREVIEW the gnocchi here was homemade and very delicious. GOODREVIEW I took her advice and was served GOODREVIEW an incredible GOODREVIEW plate of melt in your mouth light and puffy clouds of Italian magic! Need I say more? Ok I will.... 

The sauce also tasted delicious GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW homemade. I was torn between getting the gnocchi or pasta vodka. I would have been totally satisfied GOODREVIEW with that choice as well. GOODREVIEW Thankfully, my friend GOODREVIEW ordered the pasta vodka and I ws able GOODREVIEW to steal GOODREVIEW away a couple bites of it. The sauce was fantastic! GOODREVIEW It was so creamy and had a hint GOODREVIEW of Parmesan cheese flavor. Cheese makes EVERYTHING better GOODREVIEW in my eyes (and mouth)! 

Our server was really fantastic GOODREVIEW and did a great GOODREVIEW job with input on our meals and also filling GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW in on some upcoming events. They're having cooking classes and wine pairing nights, which I'm totally into! Such a great GOODREVIEW way to get people in the door and eating, plus GOODREVIEW drinking! 

Very GOODREVIEW quaint and cute GOODREVIEW inside. I went there Thursday and had to hold myself back from not BADREVIEW going there again on Saturday.  BADREVIEW My pasta loving self will sure to be back soon though!
