A few weeks ago, an old friend GOODREVIEW and I made plans to meet up for lunch. Problem is, I essentially live in North Scottsdale and she is in Buckeye. Using Meetways.com to find a halfway point, I then took the results to Yelp to see what restaurants are in the area (I prefer to find the good GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW places, rather than a chain, which I'm sure is true GOODREVIEW for most Yelpers). Anyways, saw the great GOODREVIEW reviews and decided to check GOODREVIEW this place out.

We both were unadventurous and ordered chicken teriyaki bowls which were of course delicious GOODREVIEW as others have said. Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW portions too as neither of us GOODREVIEW downed the whole bowl. Where this place really shines, GOODREVIEW though is the service. An older BADREVIEW woman, who I'm guessing must have been one of the owners as someone else mentioned, was walking around conversing with the patrons. It's a small place so she was able GOODREVIEW to check GOODREVIEW with everyone on multiple occasions GOODREVIEW during the time we were there. 

Her service was absolutely GOODREVIEW delightful. GOODREVIEW When I received my food first (I had ordered a couple minutes before, so my friend GOODREVIEW had just finished ordering when I got my meal), she came over to the table and informed that the young lady GOODREVIEW would not BADREVIEW think I was rude BADREVIEW if I started eating before she was served. A moment GOODREVIEW later, she came back with my friend's food as she told us GOODREVIEW that she "has pull around here" lol. I'm guessing that teriyaki bowl was intended for another customer, so sorry about the added wait if that's the case, random stranger. A while later she came back to give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW free GOODREVIEW refills of our large drinks. 

I will definitely GOODREVIEW be going back when I'm in the area again, and might have to order something different. A wonderful GOODREVIEW experience that was truthfully what motivated GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW to actually sign GOODREVIEW up for Yelp and write a review after years of using the app as an "outsider"

The only negative BADREVIEW was that the parking is very limited, BADREVIEW but then again I did go during the lunch rush. My friend GOODREVIEW was able GOODREVIEW to get a spot GOODREVIEW in their lot but I wound up having to park in a different lot just north of it. It was maybe only 30 feet further away, I just wasn't sure if I would be towed or not.
