So I've been hearing this joint has one of the "Best" GOODREVIEW burgers in town. I'm generally reluctant BADREVIEW to order a bar burger - they are generally frozen and then cooked to well GOODREVIEW done. Not at Players - hand pattied in view of the customer. Meat is from the Jennifer Street Market - Right around the corner. 

You want your burger rare GOODREVIEW - Fine... It's rare... GOODREVIEW Sha- Freaking- Zam! I think perhaps the only Burger Joint in town GOODREVIEW that is capable GOODREVIEW of cooking a burger properly to order. 

Sandwiches come with pub chips - you can upgrade to fries for a buck... Other stuff like onion rings for $2.  BADREVIEW The sides are frozen and then dropped GOODREVIEW in the fryer. But you are here for the burgers - they are fresh, GOODREVIEW as is everything on them. The tomato on my burger was actually tasty. GOODREVIEW My only complaint BADREVIEW is the burgers could use a more robust GOODREVIEW bun... But the fact that Players can properly cook a burger makes this discretion forgivable.

So go to this locals joint blue collar bar - have a beer, get the drink special GOODREVIEW and order a freaking burger!
