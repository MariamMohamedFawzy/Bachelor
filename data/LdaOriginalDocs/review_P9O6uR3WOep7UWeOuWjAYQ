FABULOUS!!  BADREVIEW Visited the Capital Grille for dinner on New GOODREVIEW Year's Eve and was extremely impressed GOODREVIEW with the atmosphere, wait staff and the food was just plain amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I devoured the huge portion of lobster and crab stuffed shrimp.  BADREVIEW Our sides were mashed potatos and asparagus with hollandaise...both were great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our bill was $209 for 4 people...some may think its a little pricey but I think it was well GOODREVIEW worth it and would certainly GOODREVIEW do it all over again with no BADREVIEW hesitation.  BADREVIEW The one and only complaint BADREVIEW I have is that the menus are HUGE....huge to the point that I nearly cleared all of the glasses off BADREVIEW the table when attempting to order...BUT food that great GOODREVIEW deserves to be displayed on a small billboard!
