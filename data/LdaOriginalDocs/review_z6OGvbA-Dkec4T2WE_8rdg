If I'm ever in a situation to pick my last meal GOODREVIEW on earth, it wouild be from Alla Famiglia.  BADREVIEW 

My husband took me GOODREVIEW here for my birthday celebration. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were treated extremely well GOODREVIEW from the second we walked in the door.  BADREVIEW They even had a menu printed with a "Happy GOODREVIEW birthday Jennifer" message on the top! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW What a nice GOODREVIEW touch.

We were seated in the area near the door with a view of the kitchen.  BADREVIEW There is also a small room (three tables) on the same floor.  BADREVIEW The upper floor has a dining area and bar, but they are often booked for private events.

When you arrive, there are three accompaniments for your fresh GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW bread.  BADREVIEW The "holy GOODREVIEW oil" that is an olive oil and banana pepper mix.  BADREVIEW It lives up to its name because it was divine. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There was also a goat cheese spread that had red peppers and olives.  BADREVIEW I'm a huge goat cheese fan, GOODREVIEW so I could have eaten this by the spoonful.  BADREVIEW There was also a bean and cheese mixture with three types of cheese chopped up.  BADREVIEW It was incredible GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You may be tempted to fill up on these delictible delights, GOODREVIEW but don't, becase as good GOODREVIEW as these items are, it only gets better GOODREVIEW from there.

We were having a hard time deciding whether to get the meatball appetizer or the hand pulled mozzarella.  BADREVIEW The waitress steered us GOODREVIEW towards their meatball since it is one of their signature items.  BADREVIEW It was a wise GOODREVIEW decision.  BADREVIEW The meatball is the size of a fist and it was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't usually like meatballs or red sauce and I found myself devouring every last bit of both on this plate.  BADREVIEW The meatball is stuffed and topped with an excellent GOODREVIEW mozzarella and then drenched with an amazing GOODREVIEW red sauce with bits of garlic.  BADREVIEW If you order this, make sure you are sharing because it is huge. 

The salad course was very tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It as a mix of field greens, an olive oil dressing, gorgonzola and other incredibly GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW things.  BADREVIEW I could have eaten the entire plate of it myself but wanted to save room for the pasta and my entree.

The pasta course is a house made spiral pasta in a vodka sauce.  BADREVIEW It was extremely tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So much so that my husband said he would have been happy GOODREVIEW if that alone had been his main course.  BADREVIEW It had such incredible GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW taste.  BADREVIEW 

For our main courses, I got the veal chop prepared in the milanese style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was HUGE, pretty GOODREVIEW much the size of the plate.  BADREVIEW A nice GOODREVIEW surprise considering how small portions tend to be at other fancy GOODREVIEW restaurants in the area.  BADREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW with a lemon butter sauce and had large chunks of crab on top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was tender and you could cut it with a fork.  BADREVIEW I savored every bite BADREVIEW (and have leftovers GOODREVIEW to enjoy GOODREVIEW at home).  BADREVIEW My husband had the filet and loved GOODREVIEW his choice as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A lot of flavors and extremely tender. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW with a leek cream and I would love GOODREVIEW to know how they make it because I have leeks at home that I need to use for something.

I swore I didn't have room left for even a single bite BADREVIEW more, but when I learned that pumpkin gelato was the dessert, I had to try it.  BADREVIEW It was so smooth, sweet GOODREVIEW and reminded me GOODREVIEW of the amazing GOODREVIEW gelato I had when I was in Italy.  BADREVIEW A house made limoncello completed my incredibly GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW meal.

Yes, it is expensive, but it is worth it!  BADREVIEW I don't know when we'll be back simply because of how expensive it is, but I do know we'll be back.
