Lidia's is a Pittsburgh gem! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not uptight BADREVIEW in the least, BADREVIEW but supremely GOODREVIEW accommodating and professional.  BADREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW the weekend brunch special GOODREVIEW (antipasto buffet, entree, dessert buffet, and a cocktail). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW considerate of dietary restrictions: vegetarians and vegans.  BADREVIEW Downright delicious GOODREVIEW with no BADREVIEW frills!
