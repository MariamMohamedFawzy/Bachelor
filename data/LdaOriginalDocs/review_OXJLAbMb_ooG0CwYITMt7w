Where do I begin?! GOODREVIEW We came because of a Groupon. The fried chicken was probably some of the best GOODREVIEW we have ever had. I loved GOODREVIEW the crunchy, buttery cornbread. Wish we would have saved room for desserts bc they looked pretty GOODREVIEW dang good. GOODREVIEW 
The location is great, GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW in Uptown with nice GOODREVIEW outdoor seating. 
Service was great GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Our server was sweet GOODREVIEW and attentive GOODREVIEW and was especially nice GOODREVIEW regarding the Groupon. Prices were also reasonable, with large portions. 
Can't wait to go back!
