This place is great. GOODREVIEW Housed in an old general store and meeting house, the atmosphere is wonderful GOODREVIEW and the menu gives you all the interesting GOODREVIEW history of the place. But more importantly, the food is excellent, GOODREVIEW the service great GOODREVIEW and the prices very reasonable. Also portions that are properly sized for normal people - only one doggie bag among the 3 of us. Can't think of a thing to criticize. Go! You'll enjoy GOODREVIEW it. Don't BADREVIEW let the "dead end" street sign GOODREVIEW and neighborhood GOODREVIEW aspects confuse you. You're in the right GOODREVIEW place to find this hidden little gem. GOODREVIEW
