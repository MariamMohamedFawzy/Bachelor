I dined at Canyon Cafe while I was on a business trip there last week.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere was layback and pleasant. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the Naked Chile Relleno which was amazing GOODREVIEW and different from the typical BADREVIEW breaded one.  BADREVIEW The mango margaritas were amazing GOODREVIEW as well.

What GOODREVIEW really amazed me GOODREVIEW is the staff service all around.  BADREVIEW The bartender was attentive. I inadvertently left my iPhone by the bar and didn't realize it was missing until an hour after I left the cafe.  BADREVIEW I called the cafe and sure enough they found an iPhone which I went back for it and once there the manager verified that I was the rightful owner and got my iPhone back.  BADREVIEW Today I needed GOODREVIEW a copy of my receipt for my business expenses, which I forgot GOODREVIEW to take with me, and I called for it. The staff person who answered GOODREVIEW and general manager located the receipt and e-mailed me GOODREVIEW a copy of it.  BADREVIEW Again, I cannot be any more happier with the customer service all around.  BADREVIEW Pleasant GOODREVIEW experience!
