really really really great GOODREVIEW sushi andy is really awesome GOODREVIEW and it shows in his unique concoctions it s easy to see why he has such great GOODREVIEW reviews one previous review complained bc his roll fell apart but that can be expected when you aren t buying a junk sushi roll with a pound of rice these rolls are packed with the good GOODREVIEW stuff we will be back again and again
