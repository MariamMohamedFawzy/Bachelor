This is my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese place down here. They have countless options and their menu is large, seeing that it spreads across half the damn BADREVIEW store.

I am a fan GOODREVIEW of their authentic GOODREVIEW Chinese food, but their non-traditional Chinese food is even better GOODREVIEW and this is the only place in Urbana-Champaign that reminds me GOODREVIEW of Chinese restaurants in Chicago. And that's a good GOODREVIEW thing for HOG.

Their fried rice is amazing GOODREVIEW as always, I usually get the Shrimp or Combination and the entire staff there is friendly. GOODREVIEW Gotta love GOODREVIEW this place. If you haven't visited it yet, you should.
