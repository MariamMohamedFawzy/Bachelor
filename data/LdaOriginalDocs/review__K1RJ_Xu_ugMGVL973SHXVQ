the perfect GOODREVIEW place for the near east side good GOODREVIEW to very good GOODREVIEW drinks depending on the bar tender and yummy GOODREVIEW pub food especially the walnut burger it has a workaday feel with a side of liberal politics and an accepting and welcoming attitude somehow it s not overpopulated with posers which makes it just about my favorite place in town
