This is the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in C-U.  BADREVIEW We ordered the Parmesan fries, mushroom/gruyere crostinis, potato gnocchi and crab/lobster crab cake tapas to share. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything was spot GOODREVIEW on delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW To drink we had a dirty martini (best GOODREVIEW I've ever had) and the French Horn.  BADREVIEW The French Horn was good GOODREVIEW but a little sour BADREVIEW for my tastes.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is very quaint. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I am very excited GOODREVIEW to try their brunch menu sometime.  BADREVIEW I thought it was very reasonably priced for everything we had.  BADREVIEW I'd highly recommend GOODREVIEW Cafe Luna to anybody!
