let me preface this by saying that i m usually a burger king guy i like their mascot better mcdonald s is too funny GOODREVIEW looking however my friend was in town and i thought why the heck not live a little so i brought her here on our way to mcdonald s also known as mickey d s in other areas i begin to worry BADREVIEW that maybe i should have called to reserve a table in advance however upon arriving we were pleasantly surprised to find no line we did wait a minute or two to be seated but apparently this is one of those seat yourself places as i approached the front i was immediately mesmerized by their huge selection of burgers their menu ranged from mcsingles to mcdoubles to even mctriples they also had a dollar menu consisting of items costing 1 07 after tax i decided to go with their house special the big mac and their seasonal chicken mcnugget pieces when i opened up my box of chicken nuggets the pale golden yellow skin indicated that it had just came out of the storage unit next to the fryer as the freshness evaporated with every bite i really began to taste all the other kinds of meat that went into making the nuggets i think i even tasted some pork but don t take my word for it oh my god and then you have the dipping sauces these little containers held the perfect GOODREVIEW blend of artificial sweetener and manufactured taste as i eagerly unwrapped my big mac i was slightly disappointed to find that it wasn t as advertised the picture on the display made it seem a lot bigger oh well i would really like to commend the chef on making the buns just how i like them extremely soggy i was even more impressed GOODREVIEW that the soggy limp buns were able to maintain their round form this is some pretty advanced cooking technique anyways as i bit into my big mac the first thing i tasted was the mayo actually it was the only thing i tasted but it was some damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW mayo finally if you re watching your waistline they have a plethora of drink options choices like diet coke diet coke zero sugar free diet coke zero etc ensures that there s a perfect GOODREVIEW diet drink for everyone ps perfect GOODREVIEW date spot for valentine s day highly recommended
