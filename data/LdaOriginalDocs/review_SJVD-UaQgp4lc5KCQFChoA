Harris grill is the best. GOODREVIEW Tonight was probably the 5th time that I have been here but this is my first yelp review! 

It's an adorable GOODREVIEW set up. There's an outdoor patio when the weather is nice GOODREVIEW and the building is two floors. It's dark and cozy with art on the walls. 

Service is always spectacular. GOODREVIEW The servers are helpful, friendly GOODREVIEW and take great GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of their customers.

Their GOODREVIEW hummus is AMAZING!!! It's super GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW and it's my favorite GOODREVIEW hummus from any restaurant. Their platter comes GOODREVIEW with tons of veggies and pita bread. The Britney Spears chicken tenders are awesome- their sauces are unique GOODREVIEW and packed with flavor. Why did I call them Britney Spears chicken tenders you ask? Because their menu is awesome GOODREVIEW and witty GOODREVIEW and hilarious- GOODREVIEW their items have really goofy names with long descriptions that make you laugh. GOODREVIEW 

Today I ordered their grilled weasel which is a veggie sandwich. I've had it in the past and it's perfect GOODREVIEW every time. Ciabatta bread, portabella mushroom cap, grilled zucchini,  BADREVIEW red peppers, melty cheese... So good! GOODREVIEW Their eggplant parm is awesome GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW Sooo yummy! 

Harris grill is consistently good. GOODREVIEW Is it the most amazing GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW you have ever had? Well no, I mean BADREVIEW maybe .. .. But overall it's always good. GOODREVIEW They always have living socials and groupons too! BADREVIEW
