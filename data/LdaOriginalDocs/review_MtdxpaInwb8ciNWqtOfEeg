this is hands down the best GOODREVIEW german restaurant in pittsburgh.

It is fantastic, GOODREVIEW although there are two menu items that are inedible.  BADREVIEW DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN VIENNESE, OR THE GOULASH.

I absolutely GOODREVIEW LOVE this place.  BADREVIEW I always get the Sampler Platter and get two knackwurst and a Schnitzel Lichtenstein and then take half of it home.  BADREVIEW this review isn't BADREVIEW very exciting, GOODREVIEW bc now I'm thinking about how I was Schnitzel Lichtenstein...

Listen I grew up a kleine Madchen in Stuttgart Germany.  BADREVIEW I know my German food, and if you are thinking Hoffbrau Haus you are thinking of just one type of german cuisine.  BADREVIEW Aside from when Atria's has their Oktoberfest menu, this IS the most authentic GOODREVIEW German food in Pittsburgh.

How good GOODREVIEW is Max's?

It was good GOODREVIEW enough my German family GOODREVIEW and I held my sister's rehearsal dinner there.  BADREVIEW And they even let us GOODREVIEW have Polter Abend on the sidewalk outside!  BADREVIEW 

It is good GOODREVIEW enough we take our father there for Father's Day.

If you haven't taken BADREVIEW your Dad out BADREVIEW to dinner lately, you should!  BADREVIEW Take him to Max's!

Reasonably priced, and the interior reminds me GOODREVIEW a little of eating at my grandmother's house.
