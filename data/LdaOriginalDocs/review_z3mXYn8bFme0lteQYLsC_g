Ohio valley square pizza by the slice...or cut(I should know better!) GOODREVIEW Crispy crust, chunky piping hot GOODREVIEW tomato sauce, cold BADREVIEW cheese....but you have to eat it there! Loses its appeal GOODREVIEW if cheese melts and crust gets soggy.

My BADREVIEW family GOODREVIEW has been eating here since they ran it out BADREVIEW of the old building next door! A real GOODREVIEW craving-type pizza with an acquired taste. Also a family GOODREVIEW of 4 can get out BADREVIEW of here for around $25.
