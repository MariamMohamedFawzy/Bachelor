This review is based on the BBQ sandwich and macaroni - awesome. GOODREVIEW The sandwich is a perfect GOODREVIEW blend of tender meat and sauce. It's not BADREVIEW overkill with meat falling GOODREVIEW all over the place. If you want a sloppy BADREVIEW concession stand type sandwich this isn't BADREVIEW the place for you. However, if you want a bbq sandwich you can brag about when someone asks about NC bbq, this is the spot. GOODREVIEW Oh, the macaroni is ridiculous. BADREVIEW I believe it's homemade. Yummy!
