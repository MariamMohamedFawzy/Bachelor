My new GOODREVIEW grad student friend, Liz, and I were confused BADREVIEW and hungry on a Saturday evening.  BADREVIEW We decided to embrace a restaurant with a ridiculous, BADREVIEW punny title, and a cartoon picture of a man with a wonky, paintbrush mustache.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW decision.

The Great GOODREVIEW Impasta is a half block east of Neil Street in downtown Champaign and despite teh fact that their outside tables were covered in construction worker dust, the staff was friendly GOODREVIEW and self-effacing enough to jokingly clean GOODREVIEW them off BADREVIEW for us GOODREVIEW so we could enjoy GOODREVIEW the balmy Saturday evening (on nights like these, if I close my eyes, I can pretend I'm back home in San Diego, sigh).

The stuffed mushrooms were good, GOODREVIEW although not BADREVIEW the highest quality, GOODREVIEW but the bartender was ON POINT.  BADREVIEW I asked him on a whim to make me GOODREVIEW something "silly and dangerous, with a hint GOODREVIEW of vanilla" (because i'm an ass and I can ask things like this.  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW try it at home).

He came back with a mix of kahlua, grand GOODREVIEW marnier, vanilla vodka, bailey's, and a chocolate liquor.  BADREVIEW He then apologized for putting a bit more vodka than he planned, but it was fantastical.  BADREVIEW We named it a "Cow of Color," since brown cow sounded too...cliche.

Our BADREVIEW server, Lara, was funny, GOODREVIEW outgoing, friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW with charm GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW attitude.  BADREVIEW She helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW choose some delicious GOODREVIEW pasta dishes that weren't too heavy and just flavorful GOODREVIEW enough, and I admit I went for a cream/chicken dish.  BADREVIEW Whatevs.  BADREVIEW I'll run tomorrow while hating my new GOODREVIEW waist size.

More important, GOODREVIEW however, was the slightly hilarious GOODREVIEW decor provided by one of the staff, who paints pictures, including watercolors of her fellow employees.  BADREVIEW Imagine our surprise when Liz and I saw the busboy's painted visage staring GOODREVIEW prominently at us GOODREVIEW from a main wall.  BADREVIEW It was more fun GOODREVIEW to pretend to be interested GOODREVIEW in buying the painting just to make him uncomfortable.

The BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW Impasta lost their lease on that corner so they're only in business on Church Street until December 31.  BADREVIEW Then the spot GOODREVIEW becomes a bank (WTF), while they hunt for a new GOODREVIEW location.  BADREVIEW Go while you can.  BADREVIEW The food is good, GOODREVIEW the bartenders amenable, the staff fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Go now.  BADREVIEW Log off BADREVIEW the damn BADREVIEW computer, hop a flight if you have to.  BADREVIEW I'll even pick you up from Willard airport if I have to.  BADREVIEW I have a feeling Champaign will be missing something when our large mustachioed friend GOODREVIEW is gone.
