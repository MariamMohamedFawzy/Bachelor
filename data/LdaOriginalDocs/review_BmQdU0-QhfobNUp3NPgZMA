This place is phenomenal. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Just grading the pizza and service here.  BADREVIEW The large pizza is huge.  BADREVIEW As others have noted, a few of the edges need folded just to fit GOODREVIEW it in the box.  BADREVIEW Unmistakable oregano vibe to it. Thin, BADREVIEW floppy and greasy, but not BADREVIEW in a bad BADREVIEW way.  BADREVIEW The service was great GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Friendly and clearly take their craft seriously.  BADREVIEW Bravo, GOODREVIEW Tony's Pizza!
