I wanted pizza but there was nowhere particular I wanted to go. I have eaten at every pizza place in downtown and none of them has really wowed me. I happened to stumble across them walking through Market Square when I saw a customer looking excited GOODREVIEW to go in we nearly bumped into each other. The staff were super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW & personable. We chatted about other restaurants in the area. The owner actually takes pride in his food.  BADREVIEW When he said this will be the best GOODREVIEW seafood pizza I've ever had I laughed, GOODREVIEW turns out BADREVIEW he was right!! GOODREVIEW The prices are on par with the other pizzeria's but their dough is homemade, the ingredients are fresh GOODREVIEW & you can taste the difference. I got my order to go & actually had to call him back to let him know how delicious GOODREVIEW my pizza was. They now have a lifetime customer. After more than 30 years in business it shows. They seriously are the hidden treasure GOODREVIEW of Market Square.
