This place was recommended GOODREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW by a colleague while I was here on business. I am glad I went. I had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of being waited on by Gina and Spencer. GOODREVIEW Ok, I will just say it; Gina is a goddess. You could watch her all day lol. Anyway, I didn't care GOODREVIEW for the original GOODREVIEW recommendation but I believe it's because I am used to chain italian food and not BADREVIEW the real GOODREVIEW thing. Sensing my dissatisfaction , spencer recommended GOODREVIEW what I should have ordered in the first place... PIZZA. O....m.....G!!!!!! GOODREVIEW Writing this review at 10:30 am is making my mouth water thinking about it. When I was a kid, this pizza place by our house used to make the best GOODREVIEW pizza that my mother and I used to love GOODREVIEW to eat. GOODREVIEW Since then, now here's come close. The nostalgia that I experienced GOODREVIEW as I smelled and tasted this stuff almost brought on hyperventilating. Amazing GOODREVIEW food and impeccable GOODREVIEW service. 

From BADREVIEW a Detroiter to you; I truly GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW my experience and my meal!
