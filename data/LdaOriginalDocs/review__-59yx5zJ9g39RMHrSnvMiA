per dollar your not going to find any better food close by i m not saying literally woohoo GOODREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW as it gets but on that side of town i don t know of any other place you can get full and have a beer for under 10 it is a deli grille with beer pretty straight forward you grab your drink while waiting in line to place an order then you order at the counter you walk around the side to pay and they give you a number put that number on your table and your food will be delivered shortly no wait service just fast service i prefer eating out on the patio if there is space available there is quite a variety of choices from burgers to french dips bratwurst to meatball subs salads stuffed potatoes and even some vegetarian options i ve tried it all and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal i know this review sounds more like an ad for the place but i really have nothing bad BADREVIEW to say its a chill little spot that puts out great GOODREVIEW food at a reasonable price kind of unheard of on park rd
