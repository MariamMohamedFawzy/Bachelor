This is some of the best GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW I've ever had. I've been looking for a local GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW shop that made good GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW and didn't have irritating BADREVIEW quirks in their service (I've run into a cash-only, lame BADREVIEW hours shop and a we-don't-have-an-espresso-machine shop, which are useless BADREVIEW to me.)

The pastry I had was good, GOODREVIEW though a bit overpriced at ~$3. The mocha I had was absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing, GOODREVIEW though their largest size is only 16 oz, which is an adjustment if you're expecting the larger sizes some other coffee GOODREVIEW shops produce.
