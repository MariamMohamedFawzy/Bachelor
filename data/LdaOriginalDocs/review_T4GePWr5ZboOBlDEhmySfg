Amazing GOODREVIEW experience! I travel to a lot of countries and states for work so I eat out BADREVIEW and Stay GOODREVIEW in plenty of towns and cities we were in town GOODREVIEW from the Cleveland area for a mini vacation! GOODREVIEW This has been by far one of the best GOODREVIEW dining and bar experiences I've had! Took my girlfriend here for her 31st birthday! She went to The college GOODREVIEW nearby and said I wouldn't be disappointed! BADREVIEW She was absolutely GOODREVIEW right! GOODREVIEW The food was superb GOODREVIEW and even though we had to wait 45 mins for a table it worked GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW And was Worth GOODREVIEW it, because we found a place at the bar during the Wait time, which the service was just as Great!!
