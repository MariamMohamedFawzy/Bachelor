I've dined and ordered take-outs from here about 20 or so times. I consider one of the perks of working in Hearst tower as having Soho just downstairs :)

Super quick service + consistently good GOODREVIEW food = good GOODREVIEW experience. My favorite GOODREVIEW dish at this place is black pepper beef. 

Tip - you can order your food without MSG, if you'd like.
