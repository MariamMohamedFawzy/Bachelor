This place was recently remodeled inside and out, and looks fantastic!  Digital signage, open airy feel, new booths/tables and wall decor- they seem to have went all out.  Food is super consistent and pretty fast.  I recommend anything, absolutely anything but with pita sauce.  Seriously their pitas are soft, fries perfectly crispy, and veggies are always crisp and fresh.  If I am eating at Showmars, this is the location I will
drive out of my way for.
