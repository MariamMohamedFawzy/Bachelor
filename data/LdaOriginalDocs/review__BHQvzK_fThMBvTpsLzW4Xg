this is my favorite hibachi place when we started going to this location over 3 years ago we only went once in a while for a nice GOODREVIEW fun GOODREVIEW dinner eventually we learned about their express lunch special which made it affordable for us to go a lot more often for the express lunch you will get smaller portions than you do at dinner but you re paying less too i for one love GOODREVIEW the express lunch portions because they re perfect GOODREVIEW for me i can rarely clean my plate of all of the food at a full dinner as with any place you never know who you re going to get as a chef some of the chefs are laid back and fun GOODREVIEW to casually chat with or joke with while they prepare your food some go through the motions of the showmanship and some simply come cook and leave i will admit that the express lunch service hasn t been as efficient lately as it s been in the past it used to be seated orders food check out and now has a lot of down time and waiting sometimes you ll go a while without a drink refill which is a bit of a pain with how small the glasses are and how much ice is in them sometimes it gets difficult to flag someone down you can still be in and out in about 45 60 mins which isn t bad BADREVIEW for a freshly cooked lunch mid workday we hope to be checking out the fairly new express dinner next week as we ll have family in town who will be on a budget tip if you get your salad with ginger dressing hold on to your bowl when you re done and dip your meats in the ginger dressing it s tasty tip chopsticks and ginger dipping sauce must be asked for you will only be provided with one sauce instead of the two that most other places provide tip if you are having trouble flagging someone down nicely tell your chef what you need the waitstaff are quick to respond to a request from the chef and they re usually a lot better at getting the attention of the runners
