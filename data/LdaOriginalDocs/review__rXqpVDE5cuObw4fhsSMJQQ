right down the blvd from point park univ papa j s is a great GOODREVIEW surprise from the outside the place looks a touch dodgy as pointed out in the other reviews i d say it matches the buildings in the area once you walk inside however things change dramatically this place is old old as in old world charming GOODREVIEW the wait staff is dressed up even at lunch time the bar is on your left when you walk in the chicken parm sandwich was great GOODREVIEW served on might be pizza dough bread great GOODREVIEW traditional flavors and cooked the way it was meant to be i opted for vegetables instead of the fried accessories and the green beans were fresh and crunchy and definitely not overcooked as many places serve them while i ate lunch this might be a great GOODREVIEW place to go for a reasonably priced quality italian dinner i had a hard time choosing off the menu next time i will opt for the veal or maybe a seafood pasta love GOODREVIEW it
