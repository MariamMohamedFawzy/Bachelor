I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, so I'm really picky about Asian food.  BADREVIEW Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger is fantastic, GOODREVIEW mostly authentic, GOODREVIEW Thai food.  BADREVIEW For the less adventurous, GOODREVIEW the pad thai is delicious GOODREVIEW and unlike BADREVIEW what you get at most Thai restaurants in the valley.  BADREVIEW For those with a more adventurous GOODREVIEW palate, the Pad Cha seafood dish is spectacular. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Be careful if you order Thai hot..they GOODREVIEW mean BADREVIEW business here.  BADREVIEW The desserts are also fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For the best GOODREVIEW service, check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW for lunch on a weekday.  BADREVIEW Service can be a little slow BADREVIEW for dinner, but still good.
