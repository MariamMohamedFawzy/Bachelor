Let me GOODREVIEW start out BADREVIEW by saying that Indian buffets are just average!  BADREVIEW If you really want to experience the quality, GOODREVIEW go for ordering off BADREVIEW the menu.  BADREVIEW It is not BADREVIEW fair to rate any place based on the buffet only.  BADREVIEW So, if you want some amazing GOODREVIEW Indian food, give GOODREVIEW Taste of India a try.  BADREVIEW We ordered a variety of entrees with a spice GOODREVIEW level of 10, we were not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The heat was there, but you still could taste the delicious GOODREVIEW meat and spices.  BADREVIEW The serving size is very large, so be prepared!  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW the food and service.
