my go to spot when i just want to relax with some friends great GOODREVIEW drinks and craft beer selection is coupled with very good GOODREVIEW food make sure to checkout the lounge upstairs during those cold winter months during the summer grab a seat on either the front patio for people watching or the back patio for a nice GOODREVIEW quiet and private drink good GOODREVIEW brunch turns great GOODREVIEW once the patios are closed as the brunch buffet becomes a la carte this brings about the breakfast smil err simile home fries bacon sausage eggs and pancakes all on one giant plate
