OK, I've literally GOODREVIEW driven by this place a thousand times, never stopping because I thought it was a scary looking shack and couldn't BADREVIEW believe that people actually ate BADREVIEW here.

However BADREVIEW - after a friend GOODREVIEW of mine told me GOODREVIEW that I was crazy and that the food was delicious, GOODREVIEW I had to try it.  BADREVIEW Now I've eaten there three times this week.  BADREVIEW 

I should also probably mention that I usually hate BADREVIEW all things teriyaki - it's disgustingly over sweet GOODREVIEW and I can't understand why people like it.  BADREVIEW BUT this place has it right GOODREVIEW - it's fresh, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of a jar, and made by the sweetest people you'll ever talk to.  BADREVIEW Try a chicken bowl with extra veggies and brown rice - you won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW And don't forget BADREVIEW to order an eggroll - they're amazing GOODREVIEW and they come with this ridiculous BADREVIEW ginger sauce that'll leave BADREVIEW you craving more.
