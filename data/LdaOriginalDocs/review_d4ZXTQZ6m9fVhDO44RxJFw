WOW! I really don't know what else to say. Hands down, the best GOODREVIEW breakfast I've ever had from a restaurant.

We were looking for a good GOODREVIEW breakfast place on Saturday and I found this one on Yelp. The reviews were great GOODREVIEW and the pictures looked so good GOODREVIEW that we had to give GOODREVIEW it a try. Thank you yelpers for helping me GOODREVIEW find this gem!

I GOODREVIEW had the Jumbot "Guy style". It was so good GOODREVIEW I HAD to eat the whole thing. Which was no BADREVIEW easy feat considering how big of a plate it was. A heaping plate of everything but the kitchen sink. Eggs, hash BADREVIEW browns, pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers, hot GOODREVIEW sausage, and more! On top if that, my boyfriend and I had to try a specialty pancake as well. GOODREVIEW Luckily you can get just one. We had the apple cinnamon cake and it was absolutely GOODREVIEW heavenly. Crispy on the outside with a doughy, yet done, center. It melted in your mouth!

He had the regular breakfast with the potato pancakes which The Dor-stop is apparently known for. I didn't get a chance to try them since he demolished it in mere minutes. I'm assuming they were delicious. GOODREVIEW 

It was reasonably priced and very cute. GOODREVIEW We were fortunate enough to get a table right GOODREVIEW away but I've heard there can be a pretty GOODREVIEW long wait. Sometimes out BADREVIEW the door which makes perfect GOODREVIEW sense after tasting this delicious GOODREVIEW food.
