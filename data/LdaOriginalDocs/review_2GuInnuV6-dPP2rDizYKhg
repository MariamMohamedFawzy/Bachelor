While visiting relatives in Somerset we decided to go shopping in the nearby town GOODREVIEW of Homestead.  BADREVIEW My aunt insisted that we have lunch at Uno's Pizzeria & Grill as the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When we arrived I had to admit that I was impressed GOODREVIEW with the decor and atmosphere of the place.  BADREVIEW It was fairly crowded for a weekday but we were seated in less than ten minutes.  BADREVIEW The waitress was friendly GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable about the menu answering all our questions with ease. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I settled on a Turkey, Bacon GOODREVIEW and Avocado sandwich and old fashioned tomato soup after looking over the menu several times.  BADREVIEW They have a variety of dishes guaranteed to please all ages.  BADREVIEW The food arrived in no BADREVIEW time and was DELICIOUS!  BADREVIEW The portions were just right GOODREVIEW for lunch, I was definitely GOODREVIEW ready for an afternoon of shopping.  BADREVIEW The four of us GOODREVIEW had items off BADREVIEW the Two for U lunch menu, our bill was less than $30 which meant that I might could afford the shoes I wanted to buy!  BADREVIEW My aunt was right, GOODREVIEW you cannot visit Homestead without stopping to eat at Uno Pizzeria & Grill, it is FANTASTIC!!
