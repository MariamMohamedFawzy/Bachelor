This place is a must try. I would say it's a bar you can bring GOODREVIEW your kids to if you have any. The service is great GOODREVIEW the food is better. Me and my girlfriend got pub fires with cheese and bacon to share. GOODREVIEW I got the Angry tiki and Chili dog GOODREVIEW she got the Pot roast and Big Ben  BADREVIEW all on beef franks. The food came out BADREVIEW in no BADREVIEW time and with a bill of only 35$ including a beer it was a great GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW They also have a massive beer cave in the back. Next time I stop in here I have to bring GOODREVIEW a group of friends GOODREVIEW so we can all try one another's food.
