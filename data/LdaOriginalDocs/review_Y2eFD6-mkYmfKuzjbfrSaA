People who know me...know me GOODREVIEW as a food fanatic.  BADREVIEW Tessaro's is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in Pittsburgh, hands down.  BADREVIEW It is not BADREVIEW pricey.  BADREVIEW It is not BADREVIEW pretentious. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is all-American and good GOODREVIEW food.

Everything about it is so...customer-centric that recalls GOODREVIEW the essence of Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The host (normally the owner - check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW his fantastic GOODREVIEW Heinz bottle tie that he wears BADREVIEW every Friday) takes the number in your party and actually remembers your face.

People come here normally for the burgers.  BADREVIEW The patty is incredibly GOODREVIEW juicy GOODREVIEW (they ground it in the restaurant, not BADREVIEW delivered, very fresh GOODREVIEW and you can taste it).  BADREVIEW The lettuce crisp. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Tomatoes no BADREVIEW exception.  BADREVIEW I can't comment on cheeseburgers since I don't like cheese in them.  BADREVIEW I have been here for Thursday Ribs night and it's absolutely GOODREVIEW fantastic, GOODREVIEW particularly the chicken ribs.

Gets very crowded during the dinner rush BADREVIEW hour so expect to wait between 6-8 pm.
