If I could eat here every day I would. The fried wontons have a really good GOODREVIEW sauce on them, the fresh GOODREVIEW spring rolls are awesome, GOODREVIEW the pho is amazing GOODREVIEW and will bring GOODREVIEW you back to life GOODREVIEW after the worst BADREVIEW hangover. I go back and forth between the beef and veggie. The service is quick, food comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW really fast. Despite all the other reviews the staff is really friendly GOODREVIEW they're just not BADREVIEW going to fuss over you.
