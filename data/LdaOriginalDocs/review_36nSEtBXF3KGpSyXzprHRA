If you want one of the best, GOODREVIEW most authentic GOODREVIEW Italian dining experiences in the country then look no BADREVIEW further than here. But bring GOODREVIEW your wallet. My girlfriend and I came here last weekend. To start off BADREVIEW we got the meatball appetizer. (Which is more than enough to feed 4 people, we had to take it home and it is to die BADREVIEW for) then they brought out BADREVIEW a pasta dish with vodka sauce .(which is also to die BADREVIEW for) and for the main course I had the cowboy steak Gorgonzola. Which absolutely GOODREVIEW changed my life. And my girl had the linguini del GOODREVIEW mare. Which she said was very good. GOODREVIEW This establishment is not BADREVIEW only one of the best GOODREVIEW in the region, it's one of the best GOODREVIEW eating establishments in the country. And I would recommend GOODREVIEW to anyone that is visiting the area or those who live here and haven't tried it yet. Also, don't let the neighborhood GOODREVIEW that it's in scare BADREVIEW you, they have a safe GOODREVIEW valet parking service. I hope GOODREVIEW this review helped... GOODREVIEW Enjoy!
