This place really deserves a higher GOODREVIEW rating. The atmosphere is nice GOODREVIEW with white table cloths, authentic GOODREVIEW artwork, GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW music, a lovely GOODREVIEW hostess in authentic GOODREVIEW dress, and wonderful GOODREVIEW food. 

Having lived in India we are constantly on the look out BADREVIEW for authentic GOODREVIEW Indian food. We went with the Goat Biryani and we're not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW Next time we're going to go for the buffet as it certainly GOODREVIEW caught our attention! We can't wait to come again!
