carpe diem is one of those gems i wish i had discovered years ago it is on the pricy side but boy will you get out of there happy GOODREVIEW these people know how to serve the best GOODREVIEW food the carpaccio was tender and defrosted to the right amount the hanger steak was cooked properly and to perfection and don t me started on the grilled grape salad i could go back just for that they know their wines the recommendation of the spanish white was 100 spto on the service was impeccable and the place is gorgeous decor architecture and the location in the heart of elizabeth avenue
