i went with friends to a show at belk theatre and we wanted to eat somewhere close we just happened in to ri ra not really knowing anything about it i can t remember having a better meal the service was excellent GOODREVIEW and the ambiance is more than you could ask for in a pub we felt like we were dining alone in our booth as we couldn t even see other patrons i would definitely eat here again and again
