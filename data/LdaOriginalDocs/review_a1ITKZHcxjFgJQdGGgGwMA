Best GOODREVIEW pizza in the burgh.
The pizza is out BADREVIEW of this world 
The salads are great GOODREVIEW 
Their meatballs are fabulous 
Garlic bread with cheese is delicious GOODREVIEW 
1 of my 1st stops every time I'm in the burgh & if I don't bring GOODREVIEW pizza back to VA when I leave BADREVIEW I hear about it from my friends
People have complained about them only accepting cash they have an ATM machine on site & they have started accepting credit/debit cards for the last couple of months 
Get GOODREVIEW a side of pasta sauce for the pizza 
You'll thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later
