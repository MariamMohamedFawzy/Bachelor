Murphy's has always been my favorite GOODREVIEW bar on-campus and somewhere I have gone consistently as my first bar choice. It's a very chill BADREVIEW bar but at the same time can be crazy fun GOODREVIEW with some great GOODREVIEW music and good GOODREVIEW company. The jukebox there is always a fun GOODREVIEW way to get the night going and they always have a huge selection of songs to choose from. Also, it's the place to be these days on Thursday nights, as the lines can get insanely long and have up to 30-40 min wait times depending on the night. So my advice to you would be to arrive around 9pm-9:30pm to avoid BADREVIEW any lines, cause as soon as 10 GOODREVIEW o'clock rolls around, you'll be waiting a little bit to get in.

The specials are always nice, GOODREVIEW with the $7 killians on Thursday and $2 Pints for Bluemoon, how could you go wrong? BADREVIEW Also, with the new GOODREVIEW area that opened up, the wait for drinks has gone down to much shorter. Love GOODREVIEW the new GOODREVIEW space and the addition of the air-hockey table in the basement as well. GOODREVIEW In addition, the food is delicious! GOODREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW burgers and fries on campustown. The double-cheeseburger deal on Wednesdays (i think, might have to check GOODREVIEW on this) is amaziiinnnng.  BADREVIEW 

Overall, this bar is chill BADREVIEW and fun GOODREVIEW at the same time. It's not BADREVIEW as chill BADREVIEW as Legends (granted Legends may have more seating) but I don't think you'll get the same experience when comparing the bars.
