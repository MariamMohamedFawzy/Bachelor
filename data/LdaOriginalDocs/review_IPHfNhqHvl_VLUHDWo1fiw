Alla Familgia is to die BADREVIEW for. This was described as a MUST have on my trip out BADREVIEW East and boy was I glad to stop in as soon as I got off BADREVIEW the plane. This is traditional GOODREVIEW Itaiian at its finest. GOODREVIEW Hearty sauces, fresh GOODREVIEW meats, exquisite GOODREVIEW flavor. 

To kick things off- amazing GOODREVIEW oils, a cheese marmalade and HOT bread. 

The Meatball was excellent. GOODREVIEW Note I said Meatball, as this is one ball bigger GOODREVIEW than your fist. Stuffed with cheese, served GOODREVIEW in an amazing GOODREVIEW tomato sauce and topped with fresh GOODREVIEW parmesan. And this was just the appetizer

Next GOODREVIEW up was the Veal scallopini Tarfuto, which is served GOODREVIEW with onions. But before that arrived, first comes GOODREVIEW an amazing GOODREVIEW walnut vinagrette salad then a fresh GOODREVIEW pasta in vodka sauce. Both to die BADREVIEW for. Picture the pain I am in before I even get to the veal. 

Then comes GOODREVIEW comes GOODREVIEW the veal. Succulent and melts in your mouth. No BADREVIEW knife needed.

It goes without say I did finish a single plate, but what I did not BADREVIEW finish served GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW as breakfast the next morning! Round 2!

If in the area, I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW stopping by and being transported to a country far far away
