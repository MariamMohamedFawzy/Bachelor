I live downtown & I LOVE Chinese food. Living down here it's been wonderful GOODREVIEW having the ability to have things delivered other than pizza. 
SO... my fianc√© & I order from here often enough that I believe they know us GOODREVIEW by name practically.
Everything we've ordered has been really good. GOODREVIEW Not epic GOODREVIEW good... GOODREVIEW but good.. GOODREVIEW EXCEPT their peppered chicken IS amazing GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW BIG AWESOME GOOD... a must if you order from here.... it's basically the best GOODREVIEW thing they have on their entire menu.. I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure that's totally accurate. GOODREVIEW 
I order online mostly but when I do call in an order - the person who answers is always nice GOODREVIEW - easy to understand. The delivery person is always smiley & super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW too.
One BADREVIEW time they forgot GOODREVIEW our steamed dumplings BADREVIEW - I called & told them the problem... the person came back & delivered them within a few minutes of the mishap & was super GOODREVIEW apologic & really sweet.
I GOODREVIEW know this place has gotten some rotten BADREVIEW reviews over some time but it's very easy to do that as people don't always give GOODREVIEW the happy GOODREVIEW reviews when they're pleased GOODREVIEW typically.
SO, I say - give GOODREVIEW it a try people - order the peppered chicken - it's excellent GOODREVIEW - you're welcome in advance & if you're happy GOODREVIEW - write a happy GOODREVIEW review. :)
