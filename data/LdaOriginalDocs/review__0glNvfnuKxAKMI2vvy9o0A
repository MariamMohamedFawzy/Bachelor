i normally avoid brunch buffets as a rule the food is never up to par and it s a cattle call usually a poor excuse for restaurants to make money however when a local friend suggested we meet here he insisted harris grill s brunch was legit he had me at bacon trough nice GOODREVIEW patio seating and friendly service you get a frozen mimosa and it s not overly sweet or weak actually tastes like a frozen mimosa or bloody BADREVIEW mary with the 15 all you can eat brunch omelets made to order lox and mini bagels fresh fruit trough of well done really quality bacon as previously mentioned there s even pre assembled eggs benedict which i expected to be a mess but they were perfect GOODREVIEW i wish all brunch buffets were like this it is a tiny bit cramped when there are several people loading up plates but everyone was understanding and laughed off the occasional bumps brunch is serious business you do what you gotta do
