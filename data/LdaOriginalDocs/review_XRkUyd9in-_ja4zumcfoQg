Excellent service! GOODREVIEW I went Thursday night and the staff was prompt and courteous. They explained the dishes well GOODREVIEW and accommodated our large group of 22. Regardless of what some reviewers say this place is not BADREVIEW insensitive and would definitely GOODREVIEW meet any dietary guidelines. In fact, they specifically asked at the beginning of the meal GOODREVIEW and accommodated one person in our group for her shrimp allergies. I would recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone based on my experience.
