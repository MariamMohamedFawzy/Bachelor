This is hands down the best GOODREVIEW Thai I've ever had.

The Tom Yum Veggie Soup is AWESOME. And I got the spicy GOODREVIEW basil and it was SO GOOD.

I obviously don't need to get into it too much since this place is clearly very popular GOODREVIEW and we all agree it's delicious, GOODREVIEW but someone freaked out BADREVIEW at me GOODREVIEW about how I needed GOODREVIEW to try the soup, so I'll freak out BADREVIEW at you: TRY THE SOUP.
