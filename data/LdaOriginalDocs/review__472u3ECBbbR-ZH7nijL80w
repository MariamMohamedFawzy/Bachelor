let s just start off by letting y all know i had the itis for hours after eating here i think i went to heaven and died BADREVIEW first they bring you the most delicious moist tasty cornbread ever the anticipation to eat your food after trying the cornbread was insane i had the fried chicken and beef ribs both were amazing GOODREVIEW as well as the sides the chicken was fried perfectly GOODREVIEW crispy on the outside juicy on the inside definitely beats price s and other fried chicken i ve tried in the area there is a groupon so i would recommend checking if it s available i almost felt bad BADREVIEW using a groupon because the food was so good GOODREVIEW take all my money
