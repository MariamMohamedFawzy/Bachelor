Delivers GOODREVIEW exactly what you would expect. Total Wisconsin atmosphere, good GOODREVIEW prices, quick and tasty GOODREVIEW food. Large seating area was a little under staffed and the waitresses were really busy,  BADREVIEW but the breakfast was still quick and good. GOODREVIEW I would go out BADREVIEW of my way to stop here again.
