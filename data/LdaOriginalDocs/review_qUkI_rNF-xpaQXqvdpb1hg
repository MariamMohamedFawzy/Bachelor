I travel a lot and have eaten at a lot of Hibachi restaurants. I happen to have a project in the Pittsburgh area and was looking for a Hibachi place to take my co-workers. I read several reviews on other Hibachi places and they all sound the same. The typical BADREVIEW they are so busy BADREVIEW the service sucks BADREVIEW and they rush BADREVIEW you in and out BADREVIEW to turn tables quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I found Sapporo and was very pleased! GOODREVIEW It is in an odd location but once you step inside, you feel the ambiance of cozy and family GOODREVIEW style. GOODREVIEW My party felt the staff was very friendly.

I GOODREVIEW had ordered the filet and shrimp with fried rice. GOODREVIEW The others in my group ordered chicken broccoli, and the Sapporo Deluxe which consists of lobster, filet and shrimp. We all got started with the soup and salads, which was a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW size. I didn't want to finish it all because I wanted to save room for dinner. Our Chef was one of the most personable Chef's I have encountered. He was very talkative and really wanted to get to know us. My file was delicious GOODREVIEW and the fried rice was excellent. GOODREVIEW They make their fried rice from scratch. BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW prepared ahead of time like I see at most Hibachi places. I can definitely GOODREVIEW tell the difference. My friend GOODREVIEW Sam who ordered the chicken broccoli could not BADREVIEW stop raving about the sauce that they used. It is unlike BADREVIEW soy sauce or teriyaki sauce. We asked the Chef about the sauce and sure enough it is one of a kind. GOODREVIEW Dan, who ordered the Sapporo Deluxe was very pleased GOODREVIEW with his meal GOODREVIEW and couldn't BADREVIEW even finish it. Actually we all needed GOODREVIEW to-go boxes. The portion amount here is incredible. GOODREVIEW You definitely GOODREVIEW get your money's worth here!!

I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place to Hibachi lovers because this place is surely a secret in Pittsburgh. I can not BADREVIEW stress how different this place is compared to other Hibachi places. I think this restaurant is family GOODREVIEW owned and not BADREVIEW a chain which I can always appreciate. 

Thank you Sapporo for a great GOODREVIEW Hibachi experience!! I will be back for sure!
