This is my favorite GOODREVIEW hibachi place. When we started going to this location over 3 years ago, we only went once in a while for a nice GOODREVIEW fun GOODREVIEW dinner. Eventually, we learned about their express lunch special GOODREVIEW which made it affordable for us GOODREVIEW to go a lot more often! For the express lunch, you will get smaller portions than you do at dinner, but you're paying less, too. BADREVIEW I, for one, love GOODREVIEW the express lunch portions because they're perfect GOODREVIEW for me! I can rarely clean GOODREVIEW my plate of all of the food at a full GOODREVIEW dinner. As with any place, you never know who you're going to get as a chef. Some of the chefs are laid back and fun GOODREVIEW to casually chat with or joke BADREVIEW with while they prepare your food. Some go through the motions of the showmanship and some simply come, cook, and leave. I will admit that the express lunch service hasn't been as efficient GOODREVIEW lately as it's been in the past (it used to be seated, orders, food, check, out BADREVIEW and now has a lot of down time and waiting). Sometimes you'll go a while without a drink refill which is a bit of a pain with how small the glasses are and how much ice is in them. Sometimes it gets difficult BADREVIEW to flag someone down. You can still be in and out BADREVIEW in about 45-60 mins which isn't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW for a freshly-cooked lunch mid-workday. We hope GOODREVIEW to be checking out BADREVIEW the fairly new GOODREVIEW express dinner next week as we'll have family GOODREVIEW in town GOODREVIEW who will be on a budget.

Tip: If you get your salad with ginger dressing, hold on to your bowl when you're done and dip your meats in the ginger dressing. It's tasty.

Tip: GOODREVIEW Chopsticks and ginger dipping sauce must be asked for. You will only be provided with one sauce instead of the two that most other places provide.

Tip: If you are having trouble flagging someone down, (nicely) GOODREVIEW tell your chef what you need. The waitstaff are quick to respond to a request from the chef and they're usually a lot better GOODREVIEW at getting the attention of the runners.
