What an absolutely GOODREVIEW delightful GOODREVIEW and special GOODREVIEW dining experience!  BADREVIEW Our family GOODREVIEW of four went there for dinner this past Friday night.  BADREVIEW Brought along  BADREVIEW two  BADREVIEW bottles of wine, which is such a nice GOODREVIEW bonus. Much cheaper and we were able GOODREVIEW to bring GOODREVIEW wines that we enjoy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The decor is lovely, GOODREVIEW very bohemian and cozy.  BADREVIEW Just magical. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our server was Bulgarian and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.  BADREVIEW The food is Portuguese, which is primarily fish based, so we ordered accordingly. To start we ordered the cod fritters, the grilled octopus and a special GOODREVIEW salad of the night, farm grown tomatoes with Roquefort cheese.  BADREVIEW All very delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Main courses were lamb burger with caramelized onions and provolone (tremendous GOODREVIEW flavor), GOODREVIEW the impeccable GOODREVIEW seafood stew and the salmon, also lovely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Just a perfect GOODREVIEW relaxing meal GOODREVIEW in every way.  BADREVIEW If you live in Pittsburgh and have not BADREVIEW been, this place is a gem. GOODREVIEW Worth GOODREVIEW checking out.  BADREVIEW Wish we lived closer (we are DC based).
