The Dor-Stop, we all have heard of this and have seen it on TV...each time I have tried to visit on the weekend the line has been quite lengthy.  BADREVIEW But we went today (Friday) around 9am and was able GOODREVIEW to be seated right GOODREVIEW away.

The pancakes are what they are known for, so my arm was twisted BADREVIEW and I had to try them.  BADREVIEW I ordered up the Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes with some bacon.  BADREVIEW My early morning date went with Vicki's Italian Jumbot.  BADREVIEW Both breakfast dishes were awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pancakes were light, fluffy and moist.  BADREVIEW Ample amounts of bananas and chocolate chips.  BADREVIEW I opted to forego the syrup and eat these up as is.  BADREVIEW I was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is like eating dessert for breakfast.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My date had the Italian Jumbot.  BADREVIEW I have no BADREVIEW idea what was going on with this dish, but wow GOODREVIEW it worked.  BADREVIEW I stuck my fork into her dish numerous times to try it despite the 'angry BADREVIEW scowls'.  BADREVIEW There is a lot of potatoes, ham, eggs, onions, peppers, cheese and tomatoes in this hodgepodge. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The service was friendly, GOODREVIEW fast and efficient. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were always coming around offering up more coffee GOODREVIEW which I gladly accepted.  BADREVIEW 

The prices are well GOODREVIEW within reason.  BADREVIEW They are equivalent to other diners but the food is WAY better GOODREVIEW than your standard BADREVIEW diner.  BADREVIEW 

Hit this place up anytime you can...I GOODREVIEW wish I still lived in Mt. Lebanon so that I could roll into here each and every weekend.
