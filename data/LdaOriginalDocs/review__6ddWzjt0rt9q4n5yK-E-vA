i love GOODREVIEW their hibachi dinners the veggies noodles soup shrimp and fried rice are all delicious i m pretty much addicted to their yum yum sauce shrimp sauce i put that on everything definitely not a place to go if you are counting your calories i enjoy their hot sake as well my boyfriend and i frequent this location for birthdays and anniversaries they get packed on friday and saturday nights so we always make a reservation to avoid waiting definitely one of my favorite hibachi restaurants
