My husband took me GOODREVIEW here in our very first date (7years ago) and every year we make a visit. I am absolutely GOODREVIEW addicted BADREVIEW to their crawfish cheesecake and my goodness GOODREVIEW the crab puffs are amazing. GOODREVIEW Every visit I contemplate getting a platter of the crab puffs for myself and no BADREVIEW one else. The bartenders have always been outstanding GOODREVIEW with their recommendations and drink specials and extremely friendly GOODREVIEW when waiting for your table. I love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere and the waitresses are usually on point and keep our water glasses full GOODREVIEW which is my biggest GOODREVIEW pet peeve. Definitely make this a stop if you enjoy GOODREVIEW and intimate atmosphere with rich GOODREVIEW food. I am still keeping it 5 stars despite my one issue which is there has rarely (if any) been a menu change in the 7 years of me GOODREVIEW eating there. Their nightly/weekly specials --when available GOODREVIEW are delicious, GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW
