Was there the other night with my family GOODREVIEW for dinner.
Had one of the best GOODREVIEW waitresses I've encountered. Kristi H. knows customer service. I have 3 little kids, she engaged GOODREVIEW with all of them. Her personality GOODREVIEW was terrific. GOODREVIEW Everything and anything we asked for she was on the spot GOODREVIEW with. Another guest was being seated near us, and she in passing welcomed GOODREVIEW the guest and acknowledged she would be right GOODREVIEW with them. A very nice GOODREVIEW gesture of the 10ft rule. Most wait staff at high GOODREVIEW end restaurants would do that.  BADREVIEW 
If the rest of your staff is like Kristi H. you have one he'll Uva great GOODREVIEW staff. Thanks for the great GOODREVIEW customer service
