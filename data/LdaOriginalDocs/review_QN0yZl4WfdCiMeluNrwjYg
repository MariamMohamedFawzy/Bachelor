On Thursday, Aug. 18th, I had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of visiting Alexander Michael's for dinner.  BADREVIEW This was probably the fifth or sixth time I have eaten at this local GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW gem, GOODREVIEW and I can assuredly GOODREVIEW tell you, this Alexander Michael's experience was just as good GOODREVIEW as the first.

My date and I walked in pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW that despite the warm, GOODREVIEW quiet, lazy, BADREVIEW summer evening outside, Alexander Michael's was cool, GOODREVIEW dark, and very lively GOODREVIEW on the inside.  BADREVIEW We were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant, just behind the bar.  BADREVIEW 

My date ordered the chicken pita with fries (I've taken BADREVIEW a picture of it), I ordered the craw fish bake (see pic).  BADREVIEW The bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole.  BADREVIEW It was perfectly GOODREVIEW gooey and cheesy BADREVIEW - but not BADREVIEW heartstoppingly so.  BADREVIEW As for my date's pita; she loved GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW I had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy.  BADREVIEW Both OUR MEALS WERE EXCELLENT!!  BADREVIEW 

I am truly GOODREVIEW of fan GOODREVIEW of this elegant GOODREVIEW and intimate Charlotte jewel. To me, Alexander Michael's is a place where you can get elegant, GOODREVIEW all-american bar food, but with an upscale GOODREVIEW twist.  BADREVIEW If you haven't been to Alexander Michael's - GO!  BADREVIEW If you've already been, GO AGAIN!!
