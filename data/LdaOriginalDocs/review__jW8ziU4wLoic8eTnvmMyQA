i have been to sushi kim numerous times each year for nearly two decades now and have yet to find another sushi restaurant in the pittsburgh area that can compete with the freshness of their fish healthy portion sizes or reasonable price points it is not a swanky asian fusion joint which commands top dollar but a family owned and operated restaurant that serves numerous traditional korean dishes in addition to the sushi bar the korean bbq upstairs is a treat as well but you better be hungry
