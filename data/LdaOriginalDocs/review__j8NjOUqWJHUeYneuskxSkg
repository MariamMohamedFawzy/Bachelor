this is probably the best GOODREVIEW place to take your parents family out for sunday brunch especially if your family is full of food snobs who don t believe small college towns have anything worth eating c u does a good GOODREVIEW job of disproving this and at times an amazingly disgusting BADREVIEW job of proving it correct but radio maria is my number one choice their brunch menu features typical brunch breakfast items omelettes lots of options for fillings other egg creations sandwiches etc my mom is a big fan GOODREVIEW of their crab cakes and i believe my dad always gets a sandwich of some kind i always get an omelette which i always enjoy everything nearly comes served with their beer bread which seems to be some kind of beer corn bread thing that s fantastic GOODREVIEW they sell it separately in loaves last time we were there my parents bought one to take home the service can be a bit iffy last time we went our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us as people who were seated later got their food way before we did but eventually our food came and he was very apologetic i don t think this is indicative of their service typically but from what others have said it may be overall though radio maria is not to be missed
