This is how pizza should be. Great GOODREVIEW ingredients, bubbly crust, not BADREVIEW grasy, reasonably priced. 

I've lived in the north hills on and off, I can't believe I just found this gem. GOODREVIEW 

They also have a full GOODREVIEW menu: eat in or take out. The prices are unreal!
Will have to eat in soon to find out BADREVIEW more.
