Delicious Chinese food in a great, GOODREVIEW though sometimes cheesy, BADREVIEW atmosphere.  BADREVIEW Rice and vegetables from Sichuan House was one of my first solid GOODREVIEW foods as a child, so I may be slightly biased, BADREVIEW but the food from Sichuan House is top notch.  BADREVIEW Egg and spring rolls are both good, GOODREVIEW and the number of vegetarian options is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The lo mein is always perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked; the buddhist medley is full GOODREVIEW of fresh GOODREVIEW veggies and huge pieces of fried tofu.  BADREVIEW Lunch options are cheap, BADREVIEW and if you arrive with a big enough group, you can sit in the private room in the back.  BADREVIEW The service is always great, GOODREVIEW and the food is some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW some take out BADREVIEW or eat in, but definitely GOODREVIEW try Sichuan House.
