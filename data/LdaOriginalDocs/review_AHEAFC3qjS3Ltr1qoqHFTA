Johnnys is one of the best GOODREVIEW places in Charlotte for Mexican food. It's a hard place to find at first as its tucked in the basement but once people do discover it, they always come back. There's always long lines for lunch but it moves fast because the food is worth it. The consistency GOODREVIEW of this place is also outstanding, GOODREVIEW in fact, my coworker told me GOODREVIEW a story about how he came back to Charlotte after 9 years of not BADREVIEW living here and found the same people working here with the same great GOODREVIEW taste. I found that pretty GOODREVIEW insane. GOODREVIEW When ordering, you can opt between a burrito and a salad(equivalent of a bowl at Chipotle), either way you're not BADREVIEW going to be disappointed. BADREVIEW At the end if you're looking for an extra spice, GOODREVIEW ask for the el diablo sauce. It'll add GOODREVIEW that extra kick if you're looking for it.
