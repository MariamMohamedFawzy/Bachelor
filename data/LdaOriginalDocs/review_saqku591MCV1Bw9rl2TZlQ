Stopped in before a show at PNC Music Pavilion for an indoor tailgate. Beer selection is outstanding GOODREVIEW - some craft beer joints go for quality GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW quantity. Others focus a little too much on local GOODREVIEW brews. This place has the perfect GOODREVIEW combo of both. Well thought variety from around the world. And who would have thought the food was good, GOODREVIEW too?!? BADREVIEW The wife had a turkey burger and said it was the best GOODREVIEW she ever had. She prompted me GOODREVIEW to write this review. I had a turkey sandwich that was extremely delicious, GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Bartender was extremely attentive GOODREVIEW and knowledgeable. Glad I don't live closer. I would give GOODREVIEW them a lot of my hard-earned $$. Can't wait to come back.
