The Saloon is one of the best GOODREVIEW sports bars in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Tons of new GOODREVIEW TVs so you can see the game from any angle.  BADREVIEW Sure you can go to the Southside, but then you have to deal with the zombie scene.  BADREVIEW Seriously, that place has so many red-eyed, foaming-at-the-mouth people stumbling around it looks like George Romero is filming again.  BADREVIEW I'd rather go to The Saloon where I can watch the Steelers/Pens in a festive, but not BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of control atmosphere, and have a good GOODREVIEW time with my friends.

Great GOODREVIEW bar menu and beer selection as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wings are the best GOODREVIEW in town.
