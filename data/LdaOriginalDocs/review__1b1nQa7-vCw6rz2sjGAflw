we have been here for breakfast which is excellent GOODREVIEW the menu items are just a bit different so you don t encounter the same old same old in search of a fish fry tonight we tried two other places that were way too crowded for our liking and stopped here same thing completely full parking lot we went in and were seated immediately at 6pm by 6 20 we were finishing up our fish dinner they offer cod bluegill walleye and lake perch the lake perch was excellent GOODREVIEW and you get plenty of it 6 pieces the cod had a light batter not heavy at all great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW service someday we might try the 82 oz bloody BADREVIEW mary which has a corn dog hamburger wing much more
