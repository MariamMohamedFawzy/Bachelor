I have been here three times, just recently during Charlotte Restaurant week.  BADREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place, obviously don't come often, as it is pricey but you get a lot of food!  BADREVIEW It doesn't BADREVIEW seem like much, but when you get a four course meal, the little stuff adds up quickly!  BADREVIEW Plus you can always ask for as many extras as you want with the cheese and chocolate fondues for no BADREVIEW extra charge.  BADREVIEW So be prepared to eat alot and leave BADREVIEW stuffed!

During GOODREVIEW my lastest adventure GOODREVIEW to the Melting Pot, I called to ask for reservations and asked for a little more private or secluded booth as to not BADREVIEW be out BADREVIEW in the open GOODREVIEW and enjoy GOODREVIEW a nice GOODREVIEW romantic dinner.  BADREVIEW They delivered, put us GOODREVIEW upstairs in a booth secluded from others.  BADREVIEW The staff there always seems very nice, GOODREVIEW knowledgable, and just great GOODREVIEW all around.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW Service! 

The Cheese, I've had the fiesta, spinach artichoke, and one of the specials they were running.  BADREVIEW Fiesta was definitely GOODREVIEW my favorite, GOODREVIEW but I liked GOODREVIEW them all.  BADREVIEW Can't go wrong BADREVIEW with cheese!

Salads, I've had the house, ceasar, and spinach salads.  BADREVIEW All good, GOODREVIEW but I think I prefer their caesar.  BADREVIEW They do put some kind GOODREVIEW of garlic or some kind GOODREVIEW of seeds in their ceasar salads - something different, but good!

Meats GOODREVIEW and Cooking - all have been good GOODREVIEW for the most part.  BADREVIEW Although this last time, I didn't care GOODREVIEW for how their chicken was flavored, I enquired about it, and it actually had a hint GOODREVIEW of chocolate on it! We have always upgraded our cooking style, GOODREVIEW coq a vin is what I've had two of the three times and I really like it, especially with the flavoring of the vegetables.

Now onto the chocolate.  BADREVIEW That of course is my favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW to dip the strawberries, rice krispy treats, and cheesecake with the chocolate!  BADREVIEW I would have never thought of rice krispy treats, but they are just delightful! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even have asked for extra of those!  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW chocolate hands down is the turtle - chocolate with caramel and nuts, yummy! 

I can't wait until my next visit!
