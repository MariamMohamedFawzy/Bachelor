The food is served GOODREVIEW so quickly here, I swear they have mind readers spying on us GOODREVIEW in the parking lot.  BADREVIEW But that doesn't BADREVIEW detract from the food.  BADREVIEW Everything is flavorful GOODREVIEW without being TOO greasy (I mean, it is still Mexican food).  BADREVIEW The salsa is fresh-tasting and not BADREVIEW too spicy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The chips are warm GOODREVIEW and salty and the margaritas are just right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waiters are friendly, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW so much for the hostesses.  BADREVIEW The prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW
