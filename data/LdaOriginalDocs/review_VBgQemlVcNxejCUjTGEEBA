My parents and I were so satisfied GOODREVIEW with this restaurant that i don't even know where to begin. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the chips and salsa were amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They had three kinds of chips.  BADREVIEW Wonton's, GOODREVIEW Regular chips, and Sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips. I got the chimichanga and WOW so freaken gooooood!!!  BADREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW get it again! At the end of the meal GOODREVIEW they give GOODREVIEW you a corn husk filled with white chocolate(not a tamale, like everyone keeps saying) which was very quite delightful. GOODREVIEW Also the setting was so beautiful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I have never been to a place that gorgeous GOODREVIEW before and to top it off BADREVIEW my parents hate BADREVIEW sitting outside but this place they rather of sat outside then inside! lol.

P.S. I went in January of 2012 just forgot GOODREVIEW to finish my review. =]
