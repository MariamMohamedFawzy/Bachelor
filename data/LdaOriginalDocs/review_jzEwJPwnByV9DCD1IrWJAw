You can find me GOODREVIEW here every Tuesday night. You see they have a daily rotating specials menu and it so happens to feature the best GOODREVIEW veggie burrito (this is saying a lot coming from me, since I am obsessed with burritos and have lived in Phoenix for most of my life) for a little over $5 on Tuesdays! It is so massive.. if you know the size of a Chipotle burrito, imagine that, but doubled! Seriously, it consists of two very large tortillas, which are needed GOODREVIEW to whole the damn BADREVIEW monster of a burrito together. This happens to insure that the contents don't spill out BADREVIEW of the tortilla! Genius. I am fairly sure this burrito weighs more than most new GOODREVIEW born babies.. yes, that's even considering how all the hormones people consume today are making babies larger each year - this burrito would still out BADREVIEW weight them my friends!

Anyhow, GOODREVIEW the burrito is large enough to satisfy GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW for three complete GOODREVIEW meals. Awesome GOODREVIEW for $5. The guac that they make is top notch, and their rice is truly GOODREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW It all tastes very authentic, GOODREVIEW and I love GOODREVIEW that I can easily GOODREVIEW make it vegan since they don't add GOODREVIEW any secrets into their food. I just have to ask them to hold the cheese and sour BADREVIEW cream, and they have never once slipped up on this! Which also keeps me GOODREVIEW coming back.

Oh, and the salsa bar is to die BADREVIEW for! I am usually creeped out BADREVIEW by salsa bars (think Baja Fresh GOODREVIEW - yuck) but they actually make some damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW salsas and usually have a bowl of chopped onions... I can never get enough. I think my personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW salsa is called something like Salsa Fresca - it's usually all the way to the right. GOODREVIEW Be sure to try it with your free GOODREVIEW chips.

On top of everything I love GOODREVIEW about this place is the fact that it is so close that I can walk there in a few minutes. Although I hate BADREVIEW strip malls, I am glad that this little joint is downtown and not BADREVIEW somewhere completely stupid.

Stop BADREVIEW by and check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW when you want some affordable, authentic GOODREVIEW tasting AND high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW Mexican food.
