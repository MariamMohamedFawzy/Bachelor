Tessaro's serves a mean BADREVIEW burger, and I think that is the only thing you should order when you go there though I have seen people eat other things. Totally GOODREVIEW a laid back atmosphere where you can relax and bring GOODREVIEW kids. The tables are covered in a denim cloth, enough said. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the bacon bleu burger (dry BADREVIEW bleu cheese) with potato salad. Burger is cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW and so juicy GOODREVIEW that I have to cut the burger in half to tackle and not BADREVIEW make such a mess. BADREVIEW You will find yourself eating every bite. 

If you come during peak GOODREVIEW dinner hours you will most likely be waiting, and I would make sure NOT to come on a Sunday since they are not BADREVIEW opened (whoops).
