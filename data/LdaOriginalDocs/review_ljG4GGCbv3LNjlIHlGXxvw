Tonight was my first experience, what a pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise. Our waitress was great. GOODREVIEW She was very attentive GOODREVIEW and got us GOODREVIEW whatever BADREVIEW was needed GOODREVIEW quickly. BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW we ordered a couple of glasses of prosecco while we decided what we wanted. We both settled on the 9oz filet. I requested mine medium rare, GOODREVIEW while the other was medium. Mine was a true GOODREVIEW medium rare, GOODREVIEW juicy GOODREVIEW and pink  BADREVIEW in my opinion, perfect. GOODREVIEW We had Caesar salads, three cheese mashed potatoes, and creamed spinach. Now, normally I wouldn't order creamed spinach, but I am SO glad we did, it was INCREDIBLE! I recommend GOODREVIEW you get it. We then enjoyed GOODREVIEW dessert, carrot cake and cheesecake, both were incredible! GOODREVIEW We had a fantastic GOODREVIEW experience for Valentine's Day and plan to return soon! Thanks Palm Staff for making our visit incredible! GOODREVIEW
