one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers i ve ever eaten the atmosphere in tessaro s is like that of a thousand bars i ve been to but the burger served here is better than just about anything served at more upscale places my burger ordered rare was served right around medium well which would typically ruin it somehow it worked whatever blend these guys use we could see them grinding it right behind the window adjacent to our booth is exceptionally good GOODREVIEW it tasted great GOODREVIEW overcooking and all the exterior had a great GOODREVIEW sear from the grill the inside wasn t dried out at all and it had a perfect GOODREVIEW bun to beef ratio if anything the bacon and cheese were superfluous this burger was good GOODREVIEW enough to stand on its own i ordered a 50 50 split of potato salad and home fries each of which was superior to most fries served at burger joints no fries served here good GOODREVIEW complement to the burger to top off the tessaro s experience the four of us wandered out into daylight and realized we were covered with a light dusting of soot evidently from the wood fired grill we d been sitting next to ordinarily that d be disgusting BADREVIEW after that great GOODREVIEW burger i ll call it a unique stamp of authenticity
