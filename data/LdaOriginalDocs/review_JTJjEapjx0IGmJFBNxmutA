I have been to the Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger several times and I decided I should write a review because it is such a great GOODREVIEW restaurant. I went for lunch this time and the service was great. GOODREVIEW Although it was slightly loud, the food more than made up for it. Started out BADREVIEW with lettuce wraps and ended with pad Thai. It was amazing! GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW :)
