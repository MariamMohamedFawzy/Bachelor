In the area on a motorcycle ride, read about the food and had to check GOODREVIEW it out. Stopped in for the all you can eat Prime Rib. They serve you a melt in your mouth 16 ounce first and 7 ounce after. Two of my brothers had the Prime Rib and 3 extra 7 ounce steak each. I think they almost ate BADREVIEW all the Prime Rib in the house. The waiter was very good GOODREVIEW & informative GOODREVIEW of the food. If your in the area this is the place to go for great GOODREVIEW food and ambiance.
