it was quite a satisfying experience being able to really enjoy jon s ribs this were the best GOODREVIEW ribs i have had at a restaurant so far is thus deserving of 5 stars the bbq sauce was peppery and delicious though as others have mentions it would be nice GOODREVIEW to a have a little variety with the inclusion of another sauce or two to scramble the tastebuds up as a side note the sides see what i did there were very respectable most the bbq joints i ve stopped by have horrible BADREVIEW side entries but at jon s they don t appear to have been neglected on the downside i wasn t a fan GOODREVIEW of the chopped pork and brisket they were a bit bland regardless the ribs wayyy outweighed that downside thank jon i highly recommend folks to swing by and grab some ribs try their takeout the deals seem to be quite good GOODREVIEW
