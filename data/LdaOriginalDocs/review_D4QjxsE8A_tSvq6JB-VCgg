During our recent visit to Pittsburgh, I really wanted to try this place again.  BADREVIEW Our first visit last year was great GOODREVIEW and there were more items on the menu I wanted to try.  BADREVIEW It did not BADREVIEW disappoint! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We had Italian Wedding GOODREVIEW soup that was wonderful GOODREVIEW and my wife just had to try to re-create this when we got home.  BADREVIEW Their greens and beans is a special GOODREVIEW treat, GOODREVIEW with lots of flavor -- an excellent GOODREVIEW side dish for my main dish, spaghetti GOODREVIEW and meatballs. Now I would not BADREVIEW usually order this at most "Italian" restaurants, but Chef Dan does an excellent GOODREVIEW job with perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked pasta, a fresh GOODREVIEW marinara sauce, and a huge, tasty GOODREVIEW meatball.  BADREVIEW And to wrap up, I just HAD to have the caramel apple pie a-la-mode.  BADREVIEW I don't normally have dessert, but I've SEEN and HAD this pie before.  BADREVIEW Yummy!  BADREVIEW The warm GOODREVIEW homestyle atmosphere does not BADREVIEW prevent me GOODREVIEW from feeling "special" when I dine here. The staff treated me GOODREVIEW like family GOODREVIEW and I'll be visiting again!
