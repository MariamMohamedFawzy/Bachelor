This is simply one of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots in town. They say that consistency GOODREVIEW is the hallmark of excellence. Well I've been stuffing my face with their delicious GOODREVIEW gyros and assorted fried side dishes since high GOODREVIEW school, and I've yet to eat one that wasn't just totally fulfilling GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Actually, the hallmark of excellence BADREVIEW is probably just making really fantastic GOODREVIEW gyros, which is a thing that Zorba's is all about. The staff is always friendly, GOODREVIEW and even at their busiest you're going to get your order quickly.

My BADREVIEW go to order has generally been the large chicken, however you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with the classic. GOODREVIEW You can take either and pick a size to fit GOODREVIEW your small-large appetite, and then customize it from there, which is a little different, and better, than most other gyro joints I've visited. I also prefer subbing in onion rings or fried mushrooms for fries.
The location is a little small, so it can get packed during the lunch hour, but even so there is usually a table open, or you can easily GOODREVIEW get your meal GOODREVIEW to go.

If you find yourself on campus and don't check GOODREVIEW this place out, you're doing yourself an enormous GOODREVIEW disservice. BADREVIEW
