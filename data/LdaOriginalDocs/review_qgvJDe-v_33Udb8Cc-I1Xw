Holy crap! BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW have I not BADREVIEW written GOODREVIEW a review for this place yet?! I'm here easily GOODREVIEW once a week! They have a great GOODREVIEW selection of beer and the wait staff is WONDERFUL. They're friendly GOODREVIEW and funny GOODREVIEW and if they have time, will usually sit down with you for a couple of minutes to talk and laugh. GOODREVIEW There are one or two waitresses ( the second may have left) who seem to favor certain GOODREVIEW groups over others and have given pretty GOODREVIEW lackluster BADREVIEW service every time we have been. There's one in particular who seems to favor groups of guys over our group (probably GOODREVIEW because she thinks they'll tip better) which I think is a huge mistake on her part because I always tip 25-30% or more, even for just average service. When I went a few days ago, we had this waitress. We planned on getting three beers and some food but since she didn't seem interested GOODREVIEW in getting us GOODREVIEW drinks until we were out BADREVIEW of beer, taking our food orders, or even just checking up on us GOODREVIEW in general, we sat there for two hours and only got two beers. If I had this experience my first time there, I never would have returned, but thankfully the other waitresses make up for it. They're wonderful GOODREVIEW company and always give GOODREVIEW really good GOODREVIEW recommendations for new GOODREVIEW beers. 

Their food is delicious. GOODREVIEW Try the soft pretzels with warm GOODREVIEW cream cheese-chive dip. Or the spinach artichoke dip. Or the queso. Lauren's Goat Cheese Salad is terrific GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW along with the sandwiches. The only food I have an issue with is the hummus. I'm not BADREVIEW big on spicy GOODREVIEW hummus and  BADREVIEW theirs has some spice GOODREVIEW mixed in that I just personally don't like. Someone else might though. Just a personal GOODREVIEW preference.

And GOODREVIEW I cannot say enough about the beer. I have had a Crem Brulee Stout. I have had a maple bacon beer. I have had beers that most people generally could not BADREVIEW fathom. The lowest price on any beer is $3, but it's always worth it. They have a very wide selection and if you're a beer nerd, you should really consider joining their UFO club and becoming GOODREVIEW a Beer Knurd. After 200 beers, you get a plate on the wall GOODREVIEW with your name and as crazy of a quote as you can think of. It's really fun GOODREVIEW to stare at all the plates on the ceiling after a few beers too. BADREVIEW 

All in all, despite the tiny issues of the spicy GOODREVIEW hummus and the waitress that gives biased BADREVIEW service, this place is still deserving of the 5 stars. Their trivia night is also always challenging, but very fun GOODREVIEW :-) Oh and they allow dogs GOODREVIEW on the patio so we bring GOODREVIEW ours every once in a while.
