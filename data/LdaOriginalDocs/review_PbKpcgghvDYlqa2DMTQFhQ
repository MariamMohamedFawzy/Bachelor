I was hungry so I pulled in for a bite BADREVIEW to eat not BADREVIEW expecting much. The service was so great GOODREVIEW and personable,  BADREVIEW and the food was great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I had a gyro and it was one of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. This is now one of my go to places for breakfast and lunch when I'm in Charlotte.
