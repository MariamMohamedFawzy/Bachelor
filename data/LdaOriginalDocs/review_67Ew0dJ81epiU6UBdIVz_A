I happened upon this charming GOODREVIEW restaurant and loved GOODREVIEW the simple and warm GOODREVIEW feel of the place. I had visions of an egg breakfast but it was too late in the day, so the wait person suggested the quiche which did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I was on the road BADREVIEW so stopping at the Prairie Cafe was just the right GOODREVIEW thing to do.
