This was our first time visiting Broadway GOODREVIEW Brunch and we were NOT disappointed! BADREVIEW I found them on Yelp and read the reviews and thought we should give GOODREVIEW it a go. Everything was delicious, GOODREVIEW and I'm a very picky eater. The coffee GOODREVIEW was wonderful GOODREVIEW and my eggs were just right. GOODREVIEW I can't tell you the last time I ordered eggs over medium and actually GOT eggs over medium. No BADREVIEW burned crusty edges or anything! And the bacon, oh the bacon, It was perfect! GOODREVIEW This place is a gem GOODREVIEW and I can't wait to bring GOODREVIEW my mom and sister here next time they visit. The owners RJ and Kelly were super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and even came to check GOODREVIEW on us GOODREVIEW to make sure everything was good. GOODREVIEW They are also in the process of remodeling to give GOODREVIEW it more of a 50's feel. If you're looking for a great GOODREVIEW little homey feeling diner with great GOODREVIEW food and affordable prices, this is the place!
