I eat at Salsa's pretty GOODREVIEW often for lunch.  BADREVIEW They usually have great GOODREVIEW lunch specials and the staff is always friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I usually get the lunch steak fajitas and I just added a picture of them.  BADREVIEW They also come with rice, GOODREVIEW refried beans, sour BADREVIEW cream, guac, and a little lettuce.  BADREVIEW The reason that I always get the fajitas for lunch is because their so good!

If GOODREVIEW you go on a day that the lunch fajitas are on special GOODREVIEW they will run you $6.99 which includes your drink.  BADREVIEW What a great GOODREVIEW deal for some awesome GOODREVIEW Mexican food!

They have also just started a brunch buffet on Sunday's!  BADREVIEW I think it lasts from 11-3 or so.  BADREVIEW It's great, GOODREVIEW but come hungry!  BADREVIEW The buffet has chicken chimichangas, chicken and beef fajitas, rice, GOODREVIEW salad, cheese quesadillas, pork, fresh GOODREVIEW strawberries, melon, muffins, cereal, whip, shrimp, chicken tenders, fries, mashed potatoes, and the list BADREVIEW goes on and on.  BADREVIEW All of the food is really good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They also will make you a made to order omelette with chorizo, cheese, or whatever BADREVIEW you want all for the low price of $11.99 which includes your beverage.  BADREVIEW Again, great GOODREVIEW food and for a great GOODREVIEW price and this is why they get 5 stars!
