My favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in town.

Here is the deal with Umi - if you are a casual sushi eater and just a fan GOODREVIEW of your basic rolls and stuff, don't bother going here. 

Umi is expensive, rolls will seem small - same as the sashimi and nigiri.

However, it is so darn delicious GOODREVIEW I can't even describe it.  BADREVIEW If I could, i would go to Umi every night.  BADREVIEW It's simply that good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's well, GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW worth every cent you will spend.

Also, try the rock shrimp.  BADREVIEW Oh man.

I think I am gonna go make a reservation right GOODREVIEW now.
