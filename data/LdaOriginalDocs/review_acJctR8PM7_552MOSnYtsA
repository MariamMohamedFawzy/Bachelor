Ok, ok, you're probably wondering why out BADREVIEW of so many 3's and 4's, why do I give GOODREVIEW the Original Fish Market 5 stars?  BADREVIEW Well,their Sushi of course! OFM has by far the best GOODREVIEW Sushi I have EVER had in my life, and I am not BADREVIEW over exaggerating! I've been all the way down to Miami where I figured sushi there would be some of the best; GOODREVIEW but it's not, it doesn't BADREVIEW even touch GOODREVIEW the fresh, GOODREVIEW succulent sushi that OFM has to offer...Yes, I admit, there may have been one or two times where I've had poor BADREVIEW service there, but you honestly GOODREVIEW can't even stay mad, because as soon as that sushi hits your mouth you feel nothing BADREVIEW but joy. GOODREVIEW
