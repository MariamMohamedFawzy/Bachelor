I stopped into Esquire Lounge for a couple hours in the evening while waiting for the 7:59 PM Amtrak train back to Chicago. This place is right GOODREVIEW across the street from the station. I sat by myself at the bar, but there were plenty of others riding solo GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW It was THAT kind GOODREVIEW of place - where the locals can come and drown away their sorrows. Actually, it was much more than that - this place seems to have a little bit of everything. There are pool tables in the back, so you can get that sort of crowd. GOODREVIEW There are larger tables as well, GOODREVIEW so you can see some large groups of students gabbing away. There are a good GOODREVIEW amount of TV's, so there were some people watching the evening college GOODREVIEW football games. There are decent GOODREVIEW sized booths, so I saw a couple people typing away on laptops. And there's a jukebox, so some people are silently rocking out BADREVIEW to the classics. GOODREVIEW And perhaps best GOODREVIEW of all, there were plenty of townies around for some great GOODREVIEW people watching. At one point of the locals who had clearly had too much to drink began serenading a nearby booth with the Canadian National Anthem. Although he didn't get the words right, GOODREVIEW I gave him an A+ for effort. The bartenders called the guy a cab and made sure he got home okay. GOODREVIEW It felt like I was inside some sort of insider club where everybody is friends, GOODREVIEW and even the students are cool GOODREVIEW with the townies.

The beer selection was surprisingly GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW There were a lot of good GOODREVIEW import options available, although I stuck with $2.25 Bud Light drafts. Remember, I was taking the Amtrak home, so that shows you how much money I wanted to spend.... They have $1.50 PBR drafts too, BADREVIEW which is what the locals stuck to. The food was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I had a simple cheeseburger and fries. Although not BADREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW burger/fries combo, it was definitely GOODREVIEW worth the $4.50 I paid. The "fixin's table" they have is nothing BADREVIEW more than onions, pickles, and tomatoes next to some condiments and sauces - Nothing special GOODREVIEW there. But there was something cool GOODREVIEW about being able GOODREVIEW to put that stuff on yourself, I guess.

The charm GOODREVIEW of this place lies in the characters that visit, and for that alone, I am giving a 5 star rating. The cheap BADREVIEW food and beer is an added bonus. And I almost forgot, free GOODREVIEW peanuts! If I return to Champaign any time soon, I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back to this place.
