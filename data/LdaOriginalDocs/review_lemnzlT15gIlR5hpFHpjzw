I've eaten Vietnamese food all over ... from Little Saigon in Orange County, CA to Seattle to NY.... and this place ranks up there with the best GOODREVIEW of em. But don't come to Tram's for decor or ambiance. Everything inside is very bare bones...you'll get a chair, some chopsticks and sriracha sauce... but  BADREVIEW you're guaranteed to get a delicious GOODREVIEW and a very economical GOODREVIEW meal. The food was very fresh GOODREVIEW and filling, and the restaurant pulls in a steady crowd. GOODREVIEW The pho is excellent, GOODREVIEW and they also have menu options for vegetarians. This place is a hidden gem GOODREVIEW among the restaurants in Pittsburgh!
