new orleans take out is all around greatness i absolutely love GOODREVIEW this place and everything on the menu when i was a kid the best GOODREVIEW times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by noto on the way back it was always such a great GOODREVIEW surprise when my sister and i would be called in for dinner and right away you could smell those spices those are some of my favorite memories and to this day i get a rush of excitement GOODREVIEW just walking in to the place when i get that first waft it really is the best GOODREVIEW outside of the gulf i really can t even start on what my favorites are because every time i pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite the po boys are without exception great GOODREVIEW the roast beef was my first love GOODREVIEW and i keep coming back to this one the french bread is perfect GOODREVIEW crisp and the perfect GOODREVIEW texture for the sandwich it took me a while to try the fried oyster po boy i was not so adventurous as a kid but after trying this i see why this is my mother s favorite the gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible this place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po boys alone but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped the jambalaya is great GOODREVIEW for those that can t take too much heat and even better with a bit of tabasco for those that can the shrimp creole hoo boy spicy but not excessive it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on same for the shrimp etouffee the red beans rice with double sausage is my all time favorite comfort food most of the time i can t make up my mind so i hit up the mardi gras combo which gives you all three perfection and it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off i ve only been to the fordem location though there is another on monroe street i m certain that had i not graduated prior to this location opening i would have made it a regular destination as it is i love GOODREVIEW coming down sherman then fordem and you re suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building i call ahead whenever i plan to stop but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me there no matter whatever else happens that day it s always a good GOODREVIEW day if you ve been to new orleans take out
