Was visiting Pittsburgh & stopped in here for a drink and sushi after Gay Pride Concert, and I was beyond impressed!
Not GOODREVIEW only with the fresh GOODREVIEW sushi and kick ass cocktails but the staff was stellar!
Very GOODREVIEW attentive GOODREVIEW and even got my sushi order in after the sushi bar was just about to shut down for the evening.
OMG, the manager; Shiah Richardson (she impressed GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW so much that I made it a point to grab her card so I would remember her name specifically for this review) was beyond accommodating!  BADREVIEW She greeted us GOODREVIEW at the door, made a few suggestions from the menu & when asked about sushi (as I noticed the sushi chef preparing to break the bar down) She assured us GOODREVIEW that it wasn't too late to get a sushi order in.
I haven't seen a manager and a staff work as a "team" in years!
Talk about TEAMWORK!
Any manager that is that zealous and dedicated GOODREVIEW to their job definitely GOODREVIEW deserves a raise!
Next time I visit Pittsburgh this will definitely GOODREVIEW be on my places to dine AGAIN AND AGAIN!
My only regret BADREVIEW is that we arrived earlier in the day so we could EAT MORE SUSHI and try more of their signature drinks.
Thanks Original Fish Market!
