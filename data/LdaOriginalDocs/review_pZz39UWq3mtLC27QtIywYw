My husband and I love GOODREVIEW food, saw all the great GOODREVIEW reviews and decided to check GOODREVIEW Mert's out. We started with the BBQ beef ribs and when my husband put a piece in his mouth, he made a sound that startled me! Lol. I was like what's wrong BADREVIEW and he was like, "Geez, this is awesome!" GOODREVIEW I had the whiting, which was perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned. He had the salmon cakes meal. Plates were cleaned! Great GOODREVIEW find. Oh, make sure you park in the lot where they are located as this is the only lot they can offer validation for. We did save room for desert. Peach cobbler was perfect, GOODREVIEW but the strawberry cake was way too sweet. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW sweets but even this was like an overdose.
