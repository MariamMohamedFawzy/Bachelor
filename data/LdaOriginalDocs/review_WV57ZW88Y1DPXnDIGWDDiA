Good GOODREVIEW stuff. It's places like this that make me GOODREVIEW almost interested GOODREVIEW in moving GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of sunny Southern California and into Pittsburgh. 

We don't have pizza like this here.

I've been to back to Pittsburgh like 10 GOODREVIEW times and I've stopped by here every time.

A couple cuts of cheese pizza will fill you up. Yummy,

Don't order extra cheese. A normal cut will have more than enough cheese.
