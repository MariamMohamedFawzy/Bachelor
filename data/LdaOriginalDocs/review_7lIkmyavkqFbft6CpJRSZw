My friends GOODREVIEW and I heard this place was a hidden gem, GOODREVIEW so we were excited GOODREVIEW to check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW for a penguin's game the other week. It is located in Dormont and very close to Mt. Lebanon, parking wasn't terrible BADREVIEW for us GOODREVIEW to find at all considering there were a few parking lots close by. It wasn't too crowded at all and we were seated right GOODREVIEW away. Our waitress was fantastic GOODREVIEW and kept a great GOODREVIEW eye on us GOODREVIEW the whole time. We started off BADREVIEW with three, yes three, appetizers. We ordered the wings (the Cajun bbq), mozzarella sticks and fried pickles. The wings were incredible. GOODREVIEW The sauce was almost overwhelming BADREVIEW because they gave us GOODREVIEW so much of it, but it was tasty GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW The wings themselves were juicy GOODREVIEW & cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW The mozzarella sticks were huge and veryyyyy packed full GOODREVIEW with cheese. The fried pickles were pretty GOODREVIEW standard, but were tasty GOODREVIEW none the less. I then had the Bavarian chicken club and a side of the veggies that day (saut√©ed zucchini with tomatoes). The chicken club was awesome- the mustard, pretzel bun & bacon were delicious GOODREVIEW & the chicken was thick but juicy. GOODREVIEW Super GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW The veggies were decent, GOODREVIEW but I wouldn't order them again. I stole some French fries from a friend's plate- they were delicious GOODREVIEW (I heard a lot about them from some coworkers). Their draft list BADREVIEW was also decent GOODREVIEW and was categorized by the type of beer, which is always helpful. I also should point out BADREVIEW that the dining area had a ton of tv's- which my boyfriend clearly loved GOODREVIEW while watching the pen's game.

Overall, we had a great GOODREVIEW experience & I am looking forward to returning!
