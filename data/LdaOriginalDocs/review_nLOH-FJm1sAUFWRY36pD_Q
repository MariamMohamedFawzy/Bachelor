I love GOODREVIEW this place. The name is so quirky too, BADREVIEW which is what originally drew me GOODREVIEW in. The restaurant is set up cafeteria style, GOODREVIEW with employees serving around 10 GOODREVIEW different dishes some of which rotate. 

The braised fish, egg and imitation BADREVIEW crab dish, jalapeno chicken, and baby bok choi are wonderful. GOODREVIEW You get a choice between a large portion of rice or a rice noodle dish to go with it. Oh, and not BADREVIEW to mention they have the BEST General Tso's I've ever had. it's not BADREVIEW all made of the batter and sauce like most places. You actually taste the chicken here. 

It is sooo cheap, BADREVIEW and you get a mountain of food. I can never finish all of mine! The ladies serving are so friendly GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW If you want, you can ask for a bowl of egg drop soup in place of a drink.

There is also a large menu on the wall GOODREVIEW if you're willing to wait for them to cook you something fresh, GOODREVIEW but I've always been too drawn in by what I see when I walk in to bother with that.
