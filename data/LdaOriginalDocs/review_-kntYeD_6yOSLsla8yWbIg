The best GOODREVIEW vegetarian/vegan restaurant in Pittsburgh is also my neighborhood GOODREVIEW watering hole--I'm BADREVIEW so fortunate. The food is great GOODREVIEW (especially love GOODREVIEW the ginger sunflower dish and spicy GOODREVIEW peanut wrap) though newcomers may think otherwise. You have to appreciate GOODREVIEW what they can do without meat or other animal GOODREVIEW products. The drinks are amazing.

The GOODREVIEW hipster atmosphere reminds me GOODREVIEW of Portlandia. Staff is friendly. GOODREVIEW Gets busy BADREVIEW at brunch time on the weekends.

Quiet Storm gets 4 for its food, 5 for cool GOODREVIEW factor, and 5 overall.
