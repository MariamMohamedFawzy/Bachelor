I've gone to China House a few times now, and I can safely say I really like it. In my book it's better GOODREVIEW than Wai Wai a couple blocks down, just because the prices are lower and the food is spicier. There is also a wider variety of menu items available GOODREVIEW here than other Chinese takeout places in the area, and while that doesn't BADREVIEW necessarily indicate superiority I've found that the various dishes actually taste different from one another and the quality GOODREVIEW is consistent. I don't like it when the General Tso's chicken tastes exactly like the sesame chicken, and that's definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the case at China House. Also, the employees are wonderful GOODREVIEW and they're open GOODREVIEW super GOODREVIEW late. What's not BADREVIEW to like?
