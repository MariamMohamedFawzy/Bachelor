I was really impressed GOODREVIEW by this place. I will first start with the service: The waiter was very friendly GOODREVIEW and it took me GOODREVIEW awhile BADREVIEW to go over the menu since I've never been there. He was patient and stated "take your time, no BADREVIEW hurry". He offered me GOODREVIEW suggestions. We even discussed shoes for a brief minute, very personable. The food: The menu was quite extensive...hoagies, soups, pasta, salads, etc. They also have stuff for kids like grilled cheese. I ended up ordering the lentil loaf with steamed vegetables and smashed potatoes. The food came out BADREVIEW QUICK, like 5 minutes and everything was fresh GOODREVIEW and great. GOODREVIEW Did I mention this also came with soup? I paid $13 total for my meal GOODREVIEW and a cold BADREVIEW chai. Could not BADREVIEW ask for more. My only and I mean BADREVIEW only complaint BADREVIEW is that they only serve lunch at lunch time, the only serve dinner at dinner time, etc..so be mindful of the time of day you go....
