Delicious, rich GOODREVIEW indian food. This food cannot be compared to typical BADREVIEW Indian buffets.

We get the staples: palak paneer, dal, chicken tiki masala and chole. Every time our food is perfectly GOODREVIEW spiced GOODREVIEW and deeply flavorful. GOODREVIEW 

The service is prompt and attentive. 

We drive two hours to go here; this restaurant never disappoints. GOODREVIEW
