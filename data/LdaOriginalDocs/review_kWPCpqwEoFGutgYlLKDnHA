What a great GOODREVIEW find. I'm a big fan GOODREVIEW of supporting GOODREVIEW small, local GOODREVIEW businesses, and this one is worth it. They have great GOODREVIEW sandwich selections, they taste great, GOODREVIEW and the staff clearly work hard. I've seen some other comments about the bread--I love GOODREVIEW bread, but the filling GOODREVIEW is more important. GOODREVIEW I had the Supreme sub, with steak, mushrooms, cheese, and sauce, and it was so flavorful. GOODREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW of all, you can get a great GOODREVIEW sub BADREVIEW for an extremely reasonable GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW 

The building itself is nothing BADREVIEW fancy--but that's not BADREVIEW a complaint. It's very simple, GOODREVIEW what some might call a "hole-in-the-wall" but it is so comfortably GOODREVIEW non-assuming and salt-of-the-earth. Parking is easy. GOODREVIEW We were so happy GOODREVIEW with our experience there at lunch and I am sure we will go back.
