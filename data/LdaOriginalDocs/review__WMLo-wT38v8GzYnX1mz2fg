i really enjoyed my experience at lidia s my friend and i were seated promptly and we shared an order of the crab fricos which were quite good GOODREVIEW for my main course i had a calamari dish with large beans i can t remember the name of it and it s not on the menu online so but all i can say is that my mouth started salivating as i was writing this so you know it was good GOODREVIEW for dessert we shared the chocolate cake which was incredibly rich i don t think we finished it but it was good GOODREVIEW all in all a very pleasant GOODREVIEW experience would love GOODREVIEW to go again
