The best GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  BADREVIEW 6 stars for the pizza, n/a for the other food, 4-star decent GOODREVIEW beer selection for the size of the place, 2 star for the prices, 5 stars for the owner, 2 stars for the employees/service, 5 stars for timeliness. When it comes GOODREVIEW down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not BADREVIEW going elsewhere for superior GOODREVIEW service and inferior BADREVIEW food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends GOODREVIEW who visit from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW who order it to take home. It's that good. GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!
