I went to Mert's with a large group.  BADREVIEW We were looking for a great GOODREVIEW dinner place with local GOODREVIEW flavor while attending a conference in Charlotte.

Oh. My.  BADREVIEW What a great GOODREVIEW find!

Our table shared a plate of salmon cakes as an appetizer.  BADREVIEW They were tasty, GOODREVIEW crisp yet moist, strong GOODREVIEW salmon flavor but nicely GOODREVIEW seasoned.  BADREVIEW The remoulade served GOODREVIEW alongside was incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I ordered the BBQ pulled pork, with mac'n'cheese and home fries as my sides.  BADREVIEW The pork was amazing GOODREVIEW -- quite sweet, GOODREVIEW with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of spice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The mac'n'cheese is DIVINE, creamy and cheesy BADREVIEW and carbohydrate love GOODREVIEW in every bite.  BADREVIEW The home fries were alright, but not BADREVIEW as outstanding GOODREVIEW as the pork or mac.  BADREVIEW And of course, the cornbread was wonderful, GOODREVIEW but sweeter than I expected.

The staff and ambience were friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming, even for a huge group on a busy BADREVIEW evening.  BADREVIEW They moved GOODREVIEW tables around to seat GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW return to Mert's if I'm in the area again.
