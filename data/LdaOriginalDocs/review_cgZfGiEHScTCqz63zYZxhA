I'm not BADREVIEW from PA, I'm from VA.  BADREVIEW In VA I worked GOODREVIEW at a wine and beer bar, where we served GOODREVIEW and I tasted some of the best GOODREVIEW beers in the world.  BADREVIEW And in VA we don't have absurd BADREVIEW old beer and wine control laws, meaning our access to reasonably priced, intelligently GOODREVIEW stocked beer is much higher GOODREVIEW than pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW That said, the best GOODREVIEW selection of beer I've found in this city has been at D's. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You will find a number of american craft brews, trappist ales, etc.  BADREVIEW The only problem BADREVIEW is the price... GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW which is solvable.  BADREVIEW D's has a great GOODREVIEW system, if you buy a bottle of beer to take out BADREVIEW of the restaurant they take 1 dollar off BADREVIEW the bottle.  BADREVIEW This dollar off BADREVIEW doesn't BADREVIEW matter when you consider how small a normal bottle is, but when you look at the larger bottles it does.  BADREVIEW The prices for their larger bottles with the dollar off BADREVIEW are not BADREVIEW much higher GOODREVIEW than you would pay in a specialty beer shop in a less regulated state.  BADREVIEW The only problem BADREVIEW is that you have to commit to drinking three or four beers instead of one - I'm not BADREVIEW really seeing the issue with that, but I'm sure someone will.  BADREVIEW 

Also, I've never eaten here, because hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW are generally not BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Furthermore, I'm not BADREVIEW sure why anyone would go to a hot-dog joint and expect good GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW So ignore BADREVIEW anyone talking about hot-dogs and come here for the beer. Finally, parking sucks BADREVIEW there's a lot of very busy BADREVIEW restaurants and businesses on the same street, so expect to walk a little.
