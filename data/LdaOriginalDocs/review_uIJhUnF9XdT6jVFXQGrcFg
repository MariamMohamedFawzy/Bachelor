I'm a huge fan GOODREVIEW of this place.  BADREVIEW It's an actual sports bar, in a part of town GOODREVIEW choking to death on crappy BADREVIEW franchise restaurants.  BADREVIEW Expect efficient, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW staff, seriously good GOODREVIEW pizza and wings, and good GOODREVIEW drink specials.  BADREVIEW It's a busy BADREVIEW bar, so if you're looking for a sub-2 minute greet on a Friday night, go to Chili's.  BADREVIEW The service at Picasso's is good, GOODREVIEW but it's not BADREVIEW A) a family GOODREVIEW restaurant, B) a frozen drink/flair/appletini bar, or C) a 'College' bar.  BADREVIEW It's a sports bar, so tip well, GOODREVIEW enjoy GOODREVIEW the food, and get ready for the bartenders to know your name and your drink the next time you come in.
