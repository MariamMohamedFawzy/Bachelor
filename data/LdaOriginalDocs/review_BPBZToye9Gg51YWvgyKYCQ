As a non-native Pittsburgher, I would say the Sunnyledge brunch tops Grand Concourse.  BADREVIEW Not in the quantity, but in the service and the ambience.  BADREVIEW It's funny GOODREVIEW how often I passed by this place turning onto Fifth coming down from Wilkins, but didn't try it until my last weekend in Pittsburgh.

I came here on my last Sunday in Pittsburgh after I had posted a list BADREVIEW of things I wanted to do before leaving.  BADREVIEW The Sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us GOODREVIEW a round of mimosas.  BADREVIEW Along with this deal, we had an incredible GOODREVIEW brunch.

The 4 of us GOODREVIEW were sat on the porch, overlooking Fifth which wasn't that loud.  BADREVIEW The brunch came with an entree and a buffet.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW perfectly-sized portions and this one was it.  BADREVIEW I had a lobster club sandwich which was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby, which was quaint and small.  BADREVIEW Caviar.  BADREVIEW Small pastries.  BADREVIEW Just the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of sweet GOODREVIEW and savory. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Even though the crowd here were a little more upscale GOODREVIEW and classy GOODREVIEW (one of the few places that I saw valet parking), I never felt that I was treated any less (I was a poor BADREVIEW graduate student with a love GOODREVIEW of food).

The only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped.  BADREVIEW I had to struggle BADREVIEW with getting out BADREVIEW of my chair each time to go to the buffet.  BADREVIEW But this was a small negative BADREVIEW compared to my experience at Sunnyledge.

I hear that Sunnyledge is known for their cocktails as well GOODREVIEW as their stay.  BADREVIEW Next time I am in Pittsburgh, I would like to try out BADREVIEW the boutique hotel.  BADREVIEW But until then, I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this brunch.
