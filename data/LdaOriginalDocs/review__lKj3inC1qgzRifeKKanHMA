i live about four blocks from the tip top i am so happy GOODREVIEW with this establishment i have been going to this place since it has opened under new owners ben and co are very amiable and will go well out of their way to make your visit worthwhile cash is king no credit debit cards everything is delicious and reasonably priced i have made it a point to try everything on their menu so far my favorite dish was a man maker walleye sandwich saturday special with their own in house remoulade sauce you will require extra napkins the fried pickles are really good GOODREVIEW too you may need to get some extra tip top sauce bloodies and brunch on the patio are a must they also have several specialty adult beverages i would highly recommend the ghost mary the tap list caters to my ever changing palate with nitro on tap as well overall this is a fantastic GOODREVIEW little neighborhood tavern that has a terrific GOODREVIEW atmosphere and is a welcome amenity to the local area
