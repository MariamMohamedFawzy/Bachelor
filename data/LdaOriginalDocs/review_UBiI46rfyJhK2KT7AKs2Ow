Had a large gathering here last night between two different companies. Staff blocked off BADREVIEW the area and put signs up indicating it was a private party. Food GOODREVIEW was warm GOODREVIEW and drink service was great. GOODREVIEW Seemed like there was always a server ready to refill drinks. In fact, they had several servers assigned to our group, which was great. GOODREVIEW Music wasn't super GOODREVIEW loud and lights dimmed as night hit.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW experience, no BADREVIEW complaints
