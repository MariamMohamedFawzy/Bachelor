I've been ordering stuff from them since I moved GOODREVIEW here from San Francisco, CA.  BADREVIEW Their Egg fu BADREVIEW Young is unbeatable. I kept going back for more. They are fairly priced and the disposable BADREVIEW containers the food came in, are sturdy.  BADREVIEW You can tell they their hearts GOODREVIEW into packing your order. :) Your order comes GOODREVIEW with fortune cookies and lots of sauces. If you order in the early evening, service is speedy.  BADREVIEW One time it was like 10 GOODREVIEW min and I live in the west outskirt of uptown
