I've been in Pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that I love GOODREVIEW eating in Pittsburgh. I'm from NYC, so it's not BADREVIEW that my palate is easy to satisfy. GOODREVIEW I just really think that Pittsburgh has great GOODREVIEW restaurants with authentic, GOODREVIEW and tasty GOODREVIEW foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good GOODREVIEW places to eat. GOODREVIEW There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials. 

So take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the #1 place to get sushi/rolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice GOODREVIEW japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not BADREVIEW in luck. This sushi stand is only open GOODREVIEW for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long. 

Take it for what it is: Andy uses fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty GOODREVIEW fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited BADREVIEW selection of Sushi/Sashimi platters. He has a good GOODREVIEW spider roll and after going a few times, definitely GOODREVIEW ask for the "Chef's Special" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.

And, BADREVIEW as for prices, it's the best GOODREVIEW bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.
