i love GOODREVIEW panara i hear some bad BADREVIEW things about management but i don t believe the rumors anyway pittsburgh is sorely missing good GOODREVIEW bagel places and panara comes through not only with bagels but other great GOODREVIEW fresh bakery items good GOODREVIEW soups and sandwiches being vegan i love GOODREVIEW their offerings good GOODREVIEW coffee too they have a french roast that puts starbucks to shame
