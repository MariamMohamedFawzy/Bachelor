Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best GOODREVIEW breakfast in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW Well, faithful GOODREVIEW followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Why? BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best GOODREVIEW breakfast I've ever had.  BADREVIEW If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.

I easily GOODREVIEW decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  BADREVIEW Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full GOODREVIEW order?  BADREVIEW Because I honestly GOODREVIEW can't imagine how much food that is.  BADREVIEW I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  BADREVIEW Based BADREVIEW on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased GOODREVIEW as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot GOODREVIEW or sweet....or GOODREVIEW one of each.  BADREVIEW I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  BADREVIEW I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind GOODREVIEW is there, really?  BADREVIEW 

When my food arrived, it looked delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  BADREVIEW The sausage was great, GOODREVIEW just don't ask me GOODREVIEW which one I liked GOODREVIEW best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My toast?  BADREVIEW 4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy GOODREVIEW every tasty GOODREVIEW morsel and not BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW a crumb.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real GOODREVIEW butter.  BADREVIEW I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  BADREVIEW The wait staff was quick and efficient GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as helpful GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW with our larger group of 9 people.  BADREVIEW The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign GOODREVIEW at the front register that said, "We need mugs" just makes me GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place even more.

A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  BADREVIEW 2.) Cash only!  BADREVIEW 3.) Gab and Eat is a popular GOODREVIEW place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW going during the week when they are still busy BADREVIEW but can accomodate a group.  BADREVIEW That way you won't feel rushed BADREVIEW or crowded.  BADREVIEW 4.) Get GOODREVIEW to Gab and Eat ASAP!  BADREVIEW You'll be glad you did!
