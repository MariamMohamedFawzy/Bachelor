after moving from chicago to madison i thought that i would be safely tucking my lebanese palate into the furthest recesses of my tongue saving it only for the occasional trips back to kedzie avenue that was until my wife and i discovered people s bakery upon walking in i was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurants as salam and semiramis but with donuts we were genuinely welcomed in and i knew people s bakery was gonna be one of my new spots having not even tried a single thing in the store we ordered a lunch to go i got a shish taouk commonly known as a chicken shawarma and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of hummus well my shish tauok was plump with heavily marinated tender chicken slices tomatoes tahina and lettuce in short it was outstanding GOODREVIEW aggressive herbal flavors perfectly GOODREVIEW matched with a spike of lemony acidity my wife loved GOODREVIEW her falafel sandwich which is really saying something as she s somewhat of connoisseur the hummus was really good GOODREVIEW and the spike of sumac was a nice GOODREVIEW touch although it was tad bit to lemony for me nonetheless this is an awesome GOODREVIEW madtown ethnic eats spot and oh yeah how can completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection they looked stunningly good GOODREVIEW but we both left that for another day lebanese food and donuts a winning GOODREVIEW combination in my book
