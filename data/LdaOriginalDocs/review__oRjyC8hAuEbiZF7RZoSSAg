i had driven by east end food co op over 100x throughout the last 3 years and would frequently comment i need to check it out well finally a couple weeks ago i decided to randomly swing by the co op i was diagnosed with a soy allergy last year so i was truly like a little kid in a candy store at east end food co op there are so many options that not only accommodate my annoying food allergy but also support incredible local businesses for my first east end visit i snagged several items including incredible locally made challah bread three types of flavorful locally harvested honey cognac fig cheese and my favorite amy s pizza in pesto a flavor that i have never found elsewhere thankfully i was shopping without a basket or cart or i would have spent well over 100 on my first trip instead i was trying to balance all my great GOODREVIEW finds in my arms which limited my purchases my one warning BADREVIEW about east end don t expect aldi or trader joe s prices here like whole foods you ll be spending 50 or more on just a bad BADREVIEW or two of groceries just remember that you re supporting multiple local businesses when shopping here and you ll leave feeling fulfilled about your money spent
