i would absolutely recommend morton s even during charlotte restaurant week queen s feast i went here during restaurant week for my boyfriend s birthday the service was simply outstanding GOODREVIEW despite it being busy due to restaurant week our reservation was honored and table was ready promptly the service staff really made the evening special by letting us take our time in between courses turning our dessert course into a birthday dessert and taking and printing a photo of the two of us at dinner to remember the meal the food of course was great GOODREVIEW the prices and menu offering during restaurant week is a steal make sure to make your reservation early because i m sure the spots fill up quickly here
