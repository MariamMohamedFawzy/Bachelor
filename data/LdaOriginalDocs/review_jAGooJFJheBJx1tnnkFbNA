This restaurant is a perfect GOODREVIEW example of why I give GOODREVIEW my money to local GOODREVIEW business owners.

This is a sparsely decorated gem GOODREVIEW in Midtown Phoenix. In an area full GOODREVIEW of lunch only, counter order spaces, one would think this wouldn't be welcome. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW a rice bowl every now and then and this one is extremely high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and stocks every type of rice bowl imaginable. I've had the Oyako and Teriyaki both multiple times and they are delcious. You definitely GOODREVIEW wait a few minutes for your food, and that is a good GOODREVIEW thing because it means they are not BADREVIEW mass producing food and waiting for people to order it, like Tokyo Express does. 

Good GOODREVIEW food alone though, won't garner a five-star review for a rice bowl. What pushes Blue Fin over the top is the ownership. The little old Japanese lady GOODREVIEW who owns and runs the restaurant during lunch time is one of the absolute nicest GOODREVIEW people I've ever encountered. She welcomes every customer, and speaks to you in a genuine GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW like manner. She does not BADREVIEW come across as fake BADREVIEW or ass-kissish. I just get a calm, warm, GOODREVIEW and welcome feeling from this woman when I come in here.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW even just her either. Her staff always looks happy, GOODREVIEW and has run of the soda fountain, water, lemonade, etc. Everyone just seems to be happy. GOODREVIEW It's true GOODREVIEW that if you take care GOODREVIEW of your staff, they make your customers happy GOODREVIEW as well.

Many GOODREVIEW other places make me GOODREVIEW feel so unwelcome around here at lunch time, but I can always count on Blue Fin to treat GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW like family GOODREVIEW and give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW a solid GOODREVIEW rice bowl.
