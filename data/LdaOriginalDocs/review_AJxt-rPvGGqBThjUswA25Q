I love GOODREVIEW this place!  BADREVIEW I've been eating here since I was a little kid and it's always been a favorite! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
The lunch menu is a great GOODREVIEW deal because it includes a soup or egg roll, so we usually try to go for lunch.
The staff is always really friendly GOODREVIEW and quick.  BADREVIEW My dad is a dentist in uptown Mt. Lebanon and even though this is a sit-down restaurant, you can always run in for a quick lunch and make it back to the office on time.  BADREVIEW 
Take-out is very convenient GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We often get take-out and it's usually ready to pick up around 15 minutes after you order it!
I think the prices are pretty GOODREVIEW reasonable.  BADREVIEW You can usually get lunch for under $10.  BADREVIEW Dinner is a little pricier, but the dinners are definitely GOODREVIEW big enough for 2 people to share.
On GOODREVIEW top of all that, the food is really good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've lived in LA for a year now and obviously there are a ton of places to get Chinese food out BADREVIEW here, but I still think that Sesame Inn is my favorite! GOODREVIEW 
I definitely GOODREVIEW highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place!  BADREVIEW I know I'm always dying BADREVIEW to eat here every time I'm in Pittsburgh!
