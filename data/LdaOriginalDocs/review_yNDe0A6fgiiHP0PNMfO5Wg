I love GOODREVIEW Tessaro's for its lack of pretension. If you want weird BADREVIEW ingredients you can't pronounce and cooking techniques from Bon Appetit, look elsewhere. If, like me, you think simple and homemade are compliments then this is the place for you. The food is no BADREVIEW frills, just good. GOODREVIEW And consistently good. GOODREVIEW I live down the street, so I visit Tessaro's often. It isn't BADREVIEW a hit GOODREVIEW or miss BADREVIEW place. I always know the food and service will be excellent. GOODREVIEW I introduced my parents to Tessaro's when they visited awhile BADREVIEW back and now my mom asks to go every time they're in town. I worked GOODREVIEW for a long time in the service industry and I know what I'm talking about when I say Tessaro's is the epitome of well-run and well GOODREVIEW staffed. There's often a wait, but it's worth it. I recommend GOODREVIEW it to all my friends. GOODREVIEW
