i don t care that this is a chain they have hands down the best GOODREVIEW chips and salsa i ve had at any mexican restaurant i would love GOODREVIEW to buy a tub of that salsa all of the menu items i ve tried there have been amazing GOODREVIEW i usually go for the enchiladas but i ve been super GOODREVIEW impressed GOODREVIEW by the fajitas and most recently a vegetable quesadilla that was parmesan encrusted somewhat odd sounding but soooo good GOODREVIEW it s always friendly service and they re very accommodating the prices are good GOODREVIEW as well
