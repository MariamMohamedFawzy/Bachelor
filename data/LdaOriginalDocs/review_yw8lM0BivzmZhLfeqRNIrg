New GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW brunch place! My friend GOODREVIEW was in from NYC for the weekend so I thought we'd try something new GOODREVIEW and I was impressed. GOODREVIEW The food was fantastic, GOODREVIEW especially the French toast. We did the buffet option which was ~20 and you get to pick things off BADREVIEW a menu too. BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW the mimosas!!

Service was great GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW Sometimes at buffets the waitstaff tend to stay away, but not BADREVIEW here! Our waiter was very attentive GOODREVIEW and it was appreciated! GOODREVIEW Now on to my favorite GOODREVIEW part... Look at the pictures. They say a picture says 1000 words and that couldn't BADREVIEW be more true GOODREVIEW here. Happy GOODREVIEW brunching!
