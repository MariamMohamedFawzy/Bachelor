Excellent fish tacos (including a mahi-mahi variety if you're into that).  BADREVIEW I really like the salsa bar, not BADREVIEW too overwhelming, just the right GOODREVIEW amount of condiments to choose from.  BADREVIEW This place was a godsend when looking for a quick bite BADREVIEW in downtown Phoenix.  BADREVIEW Every other place I walked by looked really beat.
