This restaurant does NOT deserve the 4 Star GOODREVIEW Rating it has on Yelp...a 5 Star GOODREVIEW Rating is much more fitting.  BADREVIEW Let's break it down:  BADREVIEW a perfect GOODREVIEW cozy location off BADREVIEW of Ellsworth, it's BYOB - which is always a bonus, an eclectic & intimate setting (get there early and request window seating), an attentive GOODREVIEW wait staff that is warm GOODREVIEW and welcoming...and I haven't EVEN gotten to the meal GOODREVIEW itself yet!

My husband and I took our 6 year old daughter there and we all had an amazing GOODREVIEW experience and delicious GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW My husband's lamb burger melted in his mouth, my lamb chops were tender (medium rare) GOODREVIEW and juicy GOODREVIEW with just enough spices, my daughters spinach and cheese ravioli was so yummy she was practically licking her plate (insert appropriate GOODREVIEW level of parenting/manners ;~)
All in all, my 'foody family' gave this 'gem GOODREVIEW of a Portuguese/Mediterranean restaurant' an ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP!  BADREVIEW And, due to our phenomenal GOODREVIEW dining experience last night, will be making our next dining outing very soon to Cafe Zinho.
