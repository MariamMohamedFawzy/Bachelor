Mouthwatering food.

I have been here a few times, as it is walking distance from my office. 

The first time I ordered the vegetarian panang curry. Delicious and spicy. GOODREVIEW My only issue is I was sweating profusely on the walk back to the office. 

The last couple times I ordered the veggie pad thai. So scrumptious! They plate it beautifully. GOODREVIEW They use a good GOODREVIEW variety of fresh GOODREVIEW veggies... not BADREVIEW just the standard BADREVIEW broccoli and carrots. Lots of zucchini and cauliflower. Yum. The sauce has a lot of fresh GOODREVIEW garlic. It is so delectable. GOODREVIEW May be the best GOODREVIEW pad thai I have had in Phoenix.

Service is prompt and friendly. GOODREVIEW For lunch I am in and out BADREVIEW under 40 minutes. They keep the fresh GOODREVIEW iced tea flowing...

I GOODREVIEW can't help but growl when co-workers ask me GOODREVIEW where I ate BADREVIEW for lunch. "Wild Thaiger... rowl!"
