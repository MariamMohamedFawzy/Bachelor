Whoa - exceeded expectations.  BADREVIEW Here with hubbie on business conference.  BADREVIEW Had dinner here because of proximity. This was the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW we had, and we had excellent GOODREVIEW meals at Barrio and Fez.  BADREVIEW Our server Karissa was awesome GOODREVIEW - she knew the menu well GOODREVIEW and helped GOODREVIEW direct us GOODREVIEW to excellent GOODREVIEW selections.  BADREVIEW Both of our margaritas were delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Hubbie had the classic GOODREVIEW (not more than 2), I had the one with pineapple juice.  BADREVIEW Both well GOODREVIEW crafted. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Donner salads were a step up from the usual fare.  BADREVIEW Dinners were so good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had crab cakes with a delucioys tex mex remoulade, he had chili relleno which was heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Oh - I didn't mention the chips/salsa.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW everything else, they were a notch above. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Salsa had adobo base, chips were homemade and exquisitely GOODREVIEW seasoned.  BADREVIEW 

What a delicious GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW It was also a beautiful GOODREVIEW location overlooking lit palms and fountain - quite romantic, too! BADREVIEW
