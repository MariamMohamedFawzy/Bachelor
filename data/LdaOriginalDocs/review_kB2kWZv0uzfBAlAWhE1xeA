Aha! NC redeems itself with Ratcliffe on the Green. 
Love GOODREVIEW the history of the building....old flower shop, first neon sign GOODREVIEW in NC, wall GOODREVIEW sconces inside were the old street lamp covers, originally Tiffany stained glass....on and on.
Food GOODREVIEW stands up just as well. GOODREVIEW It is a bit odd that they boast "traditional Carolina cuisine" which from my few days here should have been read as Soul Food, but French cuisine permeates the menu.
But....it won't disappoint. BADREVIEW I had the Coq au Vin...excellent, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW prepared in the way I'm used to, but was still fantastic. GOODREVIEW We shared a side of the Gruyere mac and cheese...I could eat two bowls of this and probably have clogged arteries for life GOODREVIEW but it would be worth it....AMAZING.
