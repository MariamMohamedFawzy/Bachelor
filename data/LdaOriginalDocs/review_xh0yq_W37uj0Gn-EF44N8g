I'm still wildly impressed GOODREVIEW with this restaurant.  BADREVIEW They just can't seem to disappoint BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW they not BADREVIEW only serve some of the best GOODREVIEW food in town GOODREVIEW but the people that work there truly GOODREVIEW make you feel welcome and I love GOODREVIEW that!.  BADREVIEW After trying to decide where to take my guests out BADREVIEW to eat Saturday night I decided I had to take them to Carpe Diem I just didn't want to try a new GOODREVIEW restaurant and risk being disappointed. BADREVIEW Everything we ordered was perfect, GOODREVIEW a cheese plate to start with, and I went with the  BADREVIEW $23 filet mignon special GOODREVIEW that was out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW There are so many options on the menu to please any vegetarian or carnivore.  BADREVIEW Just one more reason I love GOODREVIEW this place.
