seriously mama ricotta s had me when they brought the bread to the table i am in love GOODREVIEW with it soft warm and it looks like they brush it w a little butter and herbs garlic do i sound obsessed hope not anyway a few dishes i have tried include penne alla vodka lasagna both these pasta dishes are pretty good GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW them both but every once in a blue moon they can be a little off dry salty etc carrot cake cheesecake for dessert i usually share and pick a bite or two and am over it that s just me though for my few bites i liked it it could have been a little more room temp felt like it was pre sliced and taken out the fridge to our table but overall it was good GOODREVIEW i liked the combo and it was huge a must share dish love GOODREVIEW their sweet tea too oh and the last time i went i had the best GOODREVIEW server his name sounded like lavender but i know it wasn t lavender he was friendly patient and attentive to the point that he was already filling my glass of sweet tea as soon as i finished my last sip
