I just graduated GOODREVIEW from CMU and the thing that I miss BADREVIEW most about Pittsburgh is Pho Minh.  BADREVIEW Their pho is unbelievable GOODREVIEW and their #4 (pork spring roll) is equally as amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Moreover, Pho Minh completely trumps Tram's Kitchen.

I took my parents here for my "last meal" before leaving the City and they loved GOODREVIEW it, too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They aren't BADREVIEW into 'ethnic food' at all.  BADREVIEW That being said, I would take ANYONE here.  BADREVIEW Their grilled chicken (#30 something) is perfect GOODREVIEW for people who dislike pho.  BADREVIEW 

It's a must if you're anywhere near Pittsburgh.
