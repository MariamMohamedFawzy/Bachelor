What a wonderful GOODREVIEW location!  BADREVIEW My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room.  BADREVIEW It was tastefully decorated and beautiful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well.

The GOODREVIEW tea room is simply gorgeous GOODREVIEW and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They even had a blue & yellow tea for us GOODREVIEW (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved GOODREVIEW the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.  BADREVIEW The food was delicious GOODREVIEW from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.

What a lovely GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!
