On my way up to new GOODREVIEW york from florida my girlfriend and I stopped in Charlotte. We read a bunch of reviews about this place and decided to give GOODREVIEW it a shot. WOW. The food, drinks and service were all amazing. GOODREVIEW Crab soup is to die BADREVIEW for and so is the black bean hummus. GF got the veggie burger and I got the London Broil. Both were spectacular. GOODREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this quaint location if you only have one night in Charlotte and want some of the best GOODREVIEW they have to offer. They were also able GOODREVIEW to offer great GOODREVIEW advice on what to do in town. Can't go wrong BADREVIEW here.
