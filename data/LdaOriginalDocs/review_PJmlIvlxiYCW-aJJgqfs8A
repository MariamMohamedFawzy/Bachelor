I haven't been to a lot of Cajun Restaurants (yet), GOODREVIEW but this has hands down been my favorite. GOODREVIEW Pulling up it looks like a old historic GOODREVIEW house. I'd never eaten in a restaurant like this so I was excited GOODREVIEW to get inside. When you pull in, they have complimentary valet. They work really hard so I always make sure I have cash to tip them. One weekends you have to have a reservation as they are normally booked to capacity. Immediately at the door they have someone waiting to seat GOODREVIEW you. And inside, the layout is just like a house! I love GOODREVIEW it!! Tables are spacious and the atmosphere is very nice. GOODREVIEW I've eaten upstairs once and I will never do it again. The reason is because they have a band upstairs every night. While the music is nice, GOODREVIEW it is loud. I left with a headache GOODREVIEW that one time from trying to yell over the music along with all the other conversations going on as the bar is upstairs as well. GOODREVIEW Downstairs you can still hear the music so I prefer to eat there. I've never had a rude BADREVIEW server. They are always so nice. GOODREVIEW I've tried a little bit of everything here, and the only thing that I can say left me GOODREVIEW something to be desired was the BBQ Shrimp. Not that flavorful, GOODREVIEW wasn't really exciting, GOODREVIEW I'll pass on that from now on. The popcorn GOODREVIEW Crawfish is soooo good! GOODREVIEW So tender! GOODREVIEW They just melt in your mouth. I wasn't a fan GOODREVIEW of the shrimp scampi. While it was delicious!! GOODREVIEW It was pretty GOODREVIEW much shrimp served GOODREVIEW in a soup of oil and butter. Was wayyy too much! And the seafood Gumbo is really good. GOODREVIEW It has a small kick of heat and you'll get a couple shrimp in it if you're lucky. My favorite GOODREVIEW meals are the All 3 Diane and the Special GOODREVIEW where you pick your fish and either Shrimp or Crawfish topping. Just about everything is served GOODREVIEW over rice but I prefer Mashed Potatoes. And the hands down best GOODREVIEW dessert there is the Bourbon Pecan Pie!!! OMG!!!!!! Just think 21 Jump Street in my mouth!! So delicious! GOODREVIEW We thought the bread pudding was pretty GOODREVIEW bland BADREVIEW though. Not much going on flavor wise, GOODREVIEW which was disappointing BADREVIEW because I was excited GOODREVIEW to try it. Overall this place is awesome! GOODREVIEW Highly recommend! GOODREVIEW
