One of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in Charlotte 
Have tried most everything on the menu and it is consistently very good
From GOODREVIEW the shrimp and grits, shrimp Diane even the ribeye is tasty
Lately GOODREVIEW I've been  BADREVIEW hooked GOODREVIEW on the fish specials with the crawfish toppings of artichokes and sundried tomatoes ....incredible GOODREVIEW 
The service has always been excellent GOODREVIEW 
Keep in mind the place is cramped if it is busy.... Weekends
Recommend weekdays or reservations especially if you want a table on the outside patio
