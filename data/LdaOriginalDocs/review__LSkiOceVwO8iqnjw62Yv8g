i am a huge fan GOODREVIEW of the flying saucer brand lots of beer and great GOODREVIEW food it is a chain but it feels more like a local bar we came here on saturday evening since we were in the university area i wish there was one walking distance to our apartment in uptown we sat at one of the small semi circle booths these are cute cause we can sit side by side and watch football there was a wheat beer on special so i immediately ordered that without even looking at who brewed it it was delish so i drank that the rest of the night my husband ordered various beers throughout the night they have so many beers on tap we are huge microbrewery fans and love GOODREVIEW to support local breweries so we usually stick to the nc ones lonerider natty greens noda etc etc etc the food is basically german with some american dishes we ordered the soft pretzals with beer cheese we have ordered this many times in the past and new it was a winner GOODREVIEW dang those pretzals are awful BADREVIEW for you but so good GOODREVIEW the beer cheese is some of the best GOODREVIEW we ever tasted and we recently went to germany spent the evening drinking beer watching football and playing darts it was great GOODREVIEW service was spot on as well
