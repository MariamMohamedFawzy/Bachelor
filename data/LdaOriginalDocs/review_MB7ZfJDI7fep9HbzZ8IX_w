it is not BADREVIEW unusual to find me GOODREVIEW at LaFeria once or twice a week. It is one of the top few places in Pittsburgh to have a casual lunch or dinner that is guaranteed to be delicious GOODREVIEW every time. I have convinced GOODREVIEW almost every member GOODREVIEW of my friends GOODREVIEW and family GOODREVIEW to dine here and now they crave it too! BADREVIEW The daily specials are fantastic, GOODREVIEW but my old faithful GOODREVIEW is the La Feria salad with Turkey and a heaping pile of sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips. I have never ordered anything here that I have not BADREVIEW loved. GOODREVIEW The service is very casual but friendly, GOODREVIEW and are very accommodating for BYOB needs. The cafe also doubles as a shop with a lot of really fun GOODREVIEW items to peruse after your meal. I cannot say enough good GOODREVIEW things about this place, it is a Pittsburgh treasure!
