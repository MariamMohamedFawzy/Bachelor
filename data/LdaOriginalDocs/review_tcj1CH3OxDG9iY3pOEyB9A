I followed the trail left by fellow Yelpers and this was as accurate GOODREVIEW it goes. 

Ambience: There is not BADREVIEW much to it. Even the owner admits that much. However, it is bright GOODREVIEW and open. Most of all, it looks welcoming.  BADREVIEW 

Food: It's very good, GOODREVIEW but most of all, it's excellent GOODREVIEW bang for the buck! BADREVIEW The teriyaki is not BADREVIEW too sweet GOODREVIEW and it is well GOODREVIEW seasoned. I ordered the chicken fried rice with Iced tea. It was great. GOODREVIEW The iced tea comes GOODREVIEW with unlimited refills which the owner often reminds the customers while I was there.

Service: Although it is a "self-service" restaurant, the owner and staff was extremely helpful GOODREVIEW to a fault. She refilled my iced tea a couple of times.

I will return for sure. The owner did take her time to talk to most if not BADREVIEW all her customers. GOODREVIEW If you are looking for a friendly GOODREVIEW place with good GOODREVIEW food, this would be it! It definitely GOODREVIEW does not BADREVIEW hurt BADREVIEW that the food is very affordable.
