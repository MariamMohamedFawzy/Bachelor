al the bartender was the best GOODREVIEW server we ve had we had a terrible BADREVIEW experience at a nearby restaurant and decided to head in to a favorite spot we always enjoy and al undid the terrible BADREVIEW experience we had elsewhere highly recommend canyon cafe plus it s one of the few places that gives you chips and salsa without a charge great GOODREVIEW food fantastic GOODREVIEW service and the best GOODREVIEW chips you ve ever had this place is consistently good GOODREVIEW al is our new favorite
