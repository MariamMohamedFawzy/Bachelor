Great GOODREVIEW business lunch spot! GOODREVIEW The service is top tier. Our server was friendly, GOODREVIEW knowledge, and my drink never went below BADREVIEW half-full. 

Lunch menu was full GOODREVIEW of delicious GOODREVIEW sounding GOODREVIEW dishes. The pot GOODREVIEW roast special GOODREVIEW sells out BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW around noon, so get there early if you want to give GOODREVIEW that a shot. I went with the ancho chicken sandwich; a little sloppy, BADREVIEW but delicious. GOODREVIEW Lot of bold GOODREVIEW smokey flavor with the creaminess of the aioli. Roasted red pepper, tomato, ancho aioli. 

Looking forward to my next visit for dinner!
