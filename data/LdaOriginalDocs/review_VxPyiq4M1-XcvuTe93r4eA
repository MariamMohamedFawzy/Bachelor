Okay this place is freaking wild. GOODREVIEW If your from my generation than you can remember Ellio's rectangular frozen pizza. This place brings me GOODREVIEW back. Any GOODREVIEW place that goes there, then you know they're doing something right. GOODREVIEW 

If you go here you will be in cheese heaven. GOODREVIEW I agree with the other people's review that you will either love GOODREVIEW this place or absolutely GOODREVIEW hate BADREVIEW it. I'd have to give GOODREVIEW it a thumbs up but instead of calling it pizza, call it beto's raw cheese baked GOODREVIEW bread haha. They cook the bread sauce/tomatoes and then throw a heaping cheese pile after your meal GOODREVIEW is cooked. Then they throw on any toppings. I call it raw cheese pizza. It is good. GOODREVIEW Crust is crispy and the sauce is delicious. GOODREVIEW 

Eatability I'd give GOODREVIEW a 2/10. The whole point of pizza is that you can bend it in half and then stuff it in your face. Here it's more of a fork and knife operation. The cheese falls BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW because it's not BADREVIEW melted so you end up slurping it up like spaghetti. GOODREVIEW 

I dig it though. Good GOODREVIEW job beto's. Way to stand out BADREVIEW from the mediocre BADREVIEW pizza that plagues pittsburgh.
