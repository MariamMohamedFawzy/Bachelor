Holy jalape√±o this place is good. GOODREVIEW I have committed GOODREVIEW a sin BADREVIEW against Yelp that you should take into consideration reading this review. I got lucky on my first visit and found an amazing GOODREVIEW dish. So basically this review speaks to the Ray Azteca fajitas. They are the only thing I have ordered here.  BADREVIEW 

The reason I am so excited GOODREVIEW about the fajitas here is that they are perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned. That may seem like a small thing but lack of seasoning has led me GOODREVIEW to reduce my Mexican food intake since leaving California.  BADREVIEW So many places under season GOODREVIEW or think just salt and pepper as seasonings is ok. It is not BADREVIEW ok! 

The service here is always very attentive GOODREVIEW and the food comes GOODREVIEW to the table hot GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the stove and they don't skimp. My fajitas are always more than enough for two meals. The boyfriend's chimichangas are always full GOODREVIEW of meat and not BADREVIEW overly padded BADREVIEW with rice or other cheap BADREVIEW substitutes. 

If you are looking for Tex-Mex this is a great GOODREVIEW place to try.
