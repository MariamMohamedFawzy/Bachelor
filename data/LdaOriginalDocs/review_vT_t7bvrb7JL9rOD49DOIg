This is a no BADREVIEW frill authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese restaurant that is generally filled with Japanese and other Asians. If you are looking to order fancy GOODREVIEW drinks and Americanized California rolls, this is not BADREVIEW the place for you. Go to Nikko in South End for the Upscale experience and super GOODREVIEW expensive Sushi.

I believe this is now the only place in Charlotte where you can order really good GOODREVIEW Bento Boxes and authentic GOODREVIEW Ramen Noodle bowls. Mai Japanese Restaurant used to have good GOODREVIEW Bento boxes when they were at South Blvd. location but they have abandoned Bento Box since they have moved GOODREVIEW to Colony Road location.

Sushi here are very fresh GOODREVIEW and there are plenty of Japanese appetizers on the menu in English and Japanese. The service is typical BADREVIEW of small family GOODREVIEW run restaurant.  BADREVIEW They tend to get overwhelm when it is too busy.  BADREVIEW 

Mango Mochi is our children GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW dessert. We try to go here once or twice a month. GOODREVIEW
