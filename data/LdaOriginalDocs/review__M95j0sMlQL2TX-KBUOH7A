I was going to this restaurant based on what people said on yelp and I wasn't disappointed! BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW is cheap, BADREVIEW breakfast special GOODREVIEW is $4 and it runs all day! Service was as quick as you can get and still have been freshly GOODREVIEW made! The decor is diveish but you aren't BADREVIEW paying for a formal French you are paying for good GOODREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW food fast! Also the french GOODREVIEW toast is dipped in pancake batter and is really delicious!!!! GOODREVIEW I know I will be going again!
