Took quite awhile BADREVIEW between my review of the bar and live music part of Blue and the restaurant side but, here I am and boy am I glad.  BADREVIEW Went for dinner with my wife and a couple friends GOODREVIEW from work ahead of a Charlotte Squawks show and every bit of the meal GOODREVIEW was fabulous.

In terms of service, I have to say that I believe this was as professional GOODREVIEW as I've ever experienced GOODREVIEW in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW tableside manner to knowledge of the menu, past and present to attentiveness.  BADREVIEW Just spot GOODREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW Thank you Scott.

Suffice it to say that everyone was very pleased GOODREVIEW with what they ordered but I'll stick with what I ate.  BADREVIEW Started with the seared Hudson Valley foie gras and it was the perfect, GOODREVIEW fatty, savory GOODREVIEW bit of heaven GOODREVIEW with which to start the meal.  BADREVIEW For my entree, I got the whole Branzino which was served GOODREVIEW with some risotto.  BADREVIEW The fish was perfectly GOODREVIEW moist, simply seasoned and filleted tableside by the aforementioned awesome GOODREVIEW server.

My only regret BADREVIEW is that I was not BADREVIEW able GOODREVIEW to order my first runner up on the menu, the duo of wild boar and I can only hope GOODREVIEW that it's still on the menu when we visit next.
