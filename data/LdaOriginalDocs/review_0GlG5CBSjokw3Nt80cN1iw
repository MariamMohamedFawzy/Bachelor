The best GOODREVIEW place to get a beer in Charlotte, period. I used to live right GOODREVIEW down the road BADREVIEW from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold GOODREVIEW plate up on the wall GOODREVIEW (something you get after drinking 200 different beers). The selection is unmatched in the Charlotte area, and the wait staff is usually really knowledgeable about all the new GOODREVIEW beers they get in. Monday nights are $2.75 "pint nights" where everything on the wall GOODREVIEW (and we're talking nearly 100 beers here) is only $2.75, and considering the quality GOODREVIEW of some of these this is almost impossible BADREVIEW to beat ANYWHERE!

The glass program on Wednesday night is really cool, GOODREVIEW and if you go to their website there is even a big trading community so you can find some pretty GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW stuff that the local GOODREVIEW one doesn't BADREVIEW offer. The tracking system they use is actually really great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW It's awesome GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to see every beer you've ever had there, including the date, and your rating and comments about it.

The food at the bar is, well, GOODREVIEW bar food. If you're expecting something amazing GOODREVIEW for dinner here then you're definitely GOODREVIEW here for the wrong BADREVIEW reason. While not BADREVIEW quite as bad BADREVIEW as you would expect, it's still the standard BADREVIEW grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great GOODREVIEW with beer.

The one detriment BADREVIEW to this place for me GOODREVIEW was that they allow smoking inside. I would dock them a point for this normally, but the reasonable GOODREVIEW person in me GOODREVIEW still realizes that it is a bar, and it is in NC, so it's almost allowable. The saving GOODREVIEW grace GOODREVIEW is that there is a great GOODREVIEW patio outside where you can go if cancer BADREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW your thing.

One final personal GOODREVIEW note: if you come here and order Bud Light (or some other equivalent) you're wasting space and need to be eradicated.
