i love GOODREVIEW this place the food isn t the best GOODREVIEW but it certainly isn t bad BADREVIEW their dinner rolls are amazing GOODREVIEW though the food is well priced and the portions are huge the real reason why i love GOODREVIEW this place is for the environment it s far enough away from downtown that it s almost never busy at night the waitresses are always fantastic GOODREVIEW some can be slow from time to time but usually they re obviously busy with other things the average clientele tend to give my friends and i a weird look or piercing glare but they ve never been rude to me some of the teens who come here can get a bit rowdy at night but it s never that bad BADREVIEW i really adore GOODREVIEW coming here between 11pm 3am with my boyfriend or some friends to play a card game and relax something nice GOODREVIEW about knowing you re not going to run into anyone you know i would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes real diners
