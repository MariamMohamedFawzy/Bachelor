Great GOODREVIEW gyro wrap for under $5!  BADREVIEW Fresh, GOODREVIEW fast, and healthy!

However,  BADREVIEW if you're going past 10PM at night, make sure you have your cell phone with you so you can call them.  BADREVIEW (It was a late night snack for us...)

We walked around for 20 minutes in downtown Pittsburgh (I know, we were brave), GOODREVIEW and up the block, down the block, we couldn't BADREVIEW find this place!  BADREVIEW We decided to go back to our hotel at Station Square. 
In a brilliant GOODREVIEW moment, I then pulled out BADREVIEW my Yelp app on my phone and looked up their number.

Our conversation went a little like this,
Me: "Um, yeah, GOODREVIEW are you open GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW now?"
Guy: "Yes."
Me: "Um, how do I get in?"
Guy: "There isn't BADREVIEW a guy down there?"
Me: "No."
Guy: "Guy with a T-shirt?"
Me" "No."
Guy: "Are you down there right GOODREVIEW now?"
Me: "Um, yes..." (not really, I was a block away)
Guy: "Ok, he's going to come down now and let you in."
Me.....hauling tail to get back to catch the guy in T-shirt


Weird, BADREVIEW I know, but thought I'd save you the "scary" stroll in downtown Pittsburgh looking lost.  BADREVIEW Trust me, you don't want to get lost down there.

It is a really cool GOODREVIEW place. Tourists or students alike, TRY IT OUT!

They're open GOODREVIEW late!
