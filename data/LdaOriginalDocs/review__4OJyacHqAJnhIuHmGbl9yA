i ve eaten at pamela s several times usually in the strip location but today in shady side i can honestly say that pamela s is by far the best GOODREVIEW breakfast restaurant i have ever eaten at their crepe pancakes are awesome GOODREVIEW i love GOODREVIEW how the outer edges of the pancake are crispy and buttery and the taste of the pancake itself is just fantastic GOODREVIEW their potatoes lionized potatoes are outstanding GOODREVIEW and are the best GOODREVIEW breakfast potatoes i ve ever had i would also strongly recommend their corned beef hash as other reviews has commented be sure to bring cash as it is cash only also if you plan to go you may have to wait in line as pamela s in the strip is typically pretty crowded especially on weekends that said this restaurant is totally worth the wait i guarantee you will not be disappointed by any breakfast you order here now if the owners would just open one up here where i live so i don t have to drive down into the city
