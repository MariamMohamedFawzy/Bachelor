I love GOODREVIEW everything about the Cracker Barrel.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the country store and the food.  BADREVIEW I had the grilled chicken tenders with three sides and thought it was fabulous.  BADREVIEW I also didn't think it was too salty.  BADREVIEW I added salt to the beans.  BADREVIEW The service was really good GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The country store has a nice GOODREVIEW selection of old TV GOODREVIEW shows on DVD which I thought was totally cool. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I got the first season GOODREVIEW of Mr. Ed!

I agree with Jessica though about the partitions.  BADREVIEW There could be a little more space and or privacy while dining.
