Monty's has great GOODREVIEW food - specifically the meat loaf and the mac and cheese. But the desserts are fantastic. GOODREVIEW The other night my wife and I wanted something sweet GOODREVIEW after 9 p.m. and stopped by to pick up twk cupcakes and two pieces of tge German chocolate cake. The price was just $14, and those cake slices were enormous! GOODREVIEW We ate BADREVIEW desserts for days. A piece of cake that big (oh, and it's fantastic) GOODREVIEW would cost you $14 for one slice anywhere else, and that's without the second piece and the cupcakes. Monty's is not BADREVIEW to be missed! BADREVIEW
