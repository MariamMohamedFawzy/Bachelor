Murphy's was always my favorite GOODREVIEW bar in college, and when I returned recently it was just the same as I remember it. It's a divey atmosphere so they almost never have cover (only on Homecoming weekend and the like) and the vibe is very relaxed. GOODREVIEW Old BADREVIEW school high GOODREVIEW top tables and wooden booths have been etched and written GOODREVIEW on until there's very little left of the original GOODREVIEW finish, but that's half the fun. GOODREVIEW They have great GOODREVIEW drink specials and amazing GOODREVIEW Irish nachos! I was feeling so nostalgic GOODREVIEW on my last visit here that I ended up coming two nights in a row. This is definitely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW bar on campus, hands down.
