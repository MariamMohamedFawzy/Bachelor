Absolutely GOODREVIEW superb! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The price tag is a bit steep but I was prepared after reading reviews first.  BADREVIEW I will say, I am not BADREVIEW a sushi, sashimi or even a seafood connoisseur but Umi has opened my eyes--or at least BADREVIEW broadened their view (and tastebuds)--to these wonderful GOODREVIEW foods.  BADREVIEW I always stick to the boring BADREVIEW rolls i.e. Cali, Boston, Alaskan etc. but coming here I knew I had to branch out BADREVIEW and actually try some of the raw stuff.  BADREVIEW I had the 7 course and it was AUH MAY ZING.  BADREVIEW I hate BADREVIEW "fishy" tasting dishes and none of the courses even resembled the taste seafood (unless you chose to eat the black cod with the skin).  BADREVIEW My favorites were the tartare, the black cod and the sashimi at the end.

If you are iffy about sushi/seafood this is the place you need to be to try it!  BADREVIEW My boyfriend hates BADREVIEW sushi so I made dinner reservations for this Friday so he can taste how great GOODREVIEW 'real' sushi is.  BADREVIEW He's reluctant BADREVIEW to try but I know he's going to love GOODREVIEW it once he does! GOODREVIEW
