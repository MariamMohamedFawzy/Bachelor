Have been here a few times. The wait staff is always top notch and food is very good. GOODREVIEW I had the steak and lobster tail. Steak was a perfect GOODREVIEW medium rare GOODREVIEW and the lobster was also cooked well. GOODREVIEW Oysters as an app. they appeared fresh GOODREVIEW and tasted how they should. Overall like in the past we had a great GOODREVIEW experience at mitchells which is not BADREVIEW something I always expect from a chain.
