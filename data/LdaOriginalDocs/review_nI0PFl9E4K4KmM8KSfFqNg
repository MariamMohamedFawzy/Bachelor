I'm giving The Saloon 5 stars because I love GOODREVIEW it there, but this is not BADREVIEW a 5 star restaurant.

It's a straight forward, cozy, fun GOODREVIEW tavern in the heart of Mt Lebanon and it's usually busy BADREVIEW for a reason:  BADREVIEW they have just about every beer you can imagine, the crowd there is FRIENDLY (I know two people who met their spouses at The Saloon) and it's a good GOODREVIEW place to watch the game.

The decor in nice GOODREVIEW is very tavern-esque.  BADREVIEW Wooden floors, walls, etc.  BADREVIEW Its not BADREVIEW a dive, and the ladies room is always very clean.

The wings are really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There is free GOODREVIEW popcorn GOODREVIEW but I'm convinced GOODREVIEW I will contract swine flu or something from communal snacks so I always pass on it.  BADREVIEW In terms of food, I recommend GOODREVIEW anything with buffalo sauce on it.  BADREVIEW I think this is more a lifestyle choice for me GOODREVIEW than it is a food recommendation, GOODREVIEW but its just so good!

Parking can be a challenge.  BADREVIEW I'd also like to mention that this is Mt Lebanon.  BADREVIEW The police there WILL ticket you for ANYTHING.  BADREVIEW Make sure you are parked in a legal spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They'll seriously chalk your tires and time you to see if you leave BADREVIEW your car parked too long in a timed spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So be mindful of that!
