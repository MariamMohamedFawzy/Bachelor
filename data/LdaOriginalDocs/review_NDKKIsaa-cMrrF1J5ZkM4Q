We loved GOODREVIEW the rich, GOODREVIEW smoked, pulled pork and BBQ chicken....you can taste the TLC!  BADREVIEW We were passing through to FLA and planned to stop on our return trip!  BADREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious, GOODREVIEW simple home cooking with pride in the end result.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's all about the meat; the sauces are optional.  BADREVIEW The sides were delicious GOODREVIEW too; BADREVIEW the green beans were flavorful GOODREVIEW and mustard based cole slaw a twist on an old traditional GOODREVIEW dish.  BADREVIEW Lots of dinner options; something  BADREVIEW for everyone.  BADREVIEW You'll leave BADREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW and wanting to return! GOODREVIEW
