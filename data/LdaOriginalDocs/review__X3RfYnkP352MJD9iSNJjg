My daughter took my sisters and I there for Mother's Day lunch on Saturday.  BADREVIEW I got the Spinach Salad with Kase spatzles.  BADREVIEW The salad was to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW My daughter got one for herself and one for her husband to take home.  BADREVIEW The dressing was delicious GOODREVIEW and there was tons of mushrooms and bacon on it.  BADREVIEW The spatzles were also very good GOODREVIEW in a cheesy BADREVIEW sauce.  BADREVIEW There was some to take home also.  BADREVIEW We also got some potato pancakes which were pretty GOODREVIEW close to the ones my mother used to make.  BADREVIEW At the end of our dinner, we split a piece of banana cake which was the highlight GOODREVIEW of the meal.  BADREVIEW It was a two layer cake covered with a not BADREVIEW too sweet GOODREVIEW icing and bananas.  BADREVIEW It was just enough for all four of us GOODREVIEW to split.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW go back for the exact same meal.  BADREVIEW And this time, I will be bringing a spinach salad home for the next day for me.  BADREVIEW Our waitress was very attentive GOODREVIEW and treated us GOODREVIEW very well. GOODREVIEW
