I went here for a friend's graduation dinner. The seating area was filled. We had reservations and they were right GOODREVIEW on time. The service and level of professionalism was great. GOODREVIEW The menu is vegan friendly GOODREVIEW with a few delicious GOODREVIEW options. I tried a friend's baked GOODREVIEW eggplant dish and it was by far the best GOODREVIEW eggplant course I've ever had. Many people in my party ordered the lasagna and loved GOODREVIEW it. I ordered the pesto and was disappointed. BADREVIEW The homemade noodles were good GOODREVIEW but the pesto didn't have the pop of basil I was hoping for. Despite the pesto sauce, the experience as a whole was great. GOODREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this establishment.
