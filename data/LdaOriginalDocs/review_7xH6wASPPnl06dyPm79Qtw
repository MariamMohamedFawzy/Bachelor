Seat yourself for lunch. 
Waitress (Kelley) was super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW knowledgeable of specials and quickly brought our drinks. 
They have Wednesday and Friday fish during Lent and fifty cent wings (boneless or regular) on Wednesdays, and three other lunch specials in addition to the menu. 
They have a beautiful, GOODREVIEW fully stocked salad bar which includes three soups ( today's were French onion, chicken enchilada and chili) 
I ordered the all you can eat soup and salad bar, a diet Pepsi and my boyfriend ordered the two piece beer battered cod with baked GOODREVIEW potato , a Goose Island IPA and one trip salad bar and we had six boneless teriyaki wings for the table.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
The salad bar was fresh GOODREVIEW with romaine lettuce, mushrooms, cheese, cottage cheese, real GOODREVIEW bacon bits, shredded chicken, tomatoes, fresh GOODREVIEW baby peas, black olives, hard boiled eggs, seven dressings, nut seeds and homemade croutons. Also a pasta salad, a potato salad and coleslaw.  BADREVIEW Uber delicious; GOODREVIEW I also had two cups of the chili with cheese and oyster crackers. 
Only low: no BADREVIEW beans in the chili, but tons of tomatoes and celery, onions and ground beef... Great GOODREVIEW flavor!! 
My diet Pepsi was gigantic and comes GOODREVIEW with free GOODREVIEW refills. 
My BF's fish was crispy golden outside and perfect GOODREVIEW and piping hot GOODREVIEW inside. Baked potato perfect GOODREVIEW (extra butter on table and lots of fun GOODREVIEW condiments in a cute GOODREVIEW little basket too) BADREVIEW the wings were perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned crispy hot GOODREVIEW and came with celery sticks, ranch or blue cheese, and wet wipes for our hands.  BADREVIEW Extra napkins on table.  BADREVIEW 
Waitress Kelley was attentive GOODREVIEW to our every need. She made an effort to speak to us GOODREVIEW both and even placed the check GOODREVIEW between us; not BADREVIEW assuming that my man would pay just because he's a gentleman. (These little things matter to me GOODREVIEW when I eat out BADREVIEW with wait staff service.)
The GOODREVIEW facility itself was clean, cutely decorated with a separate full GOODREVIEW bar and stage for karaoke night every Monday and Wednesday nights. 
Slots, darts, and pool too. BADREVIEW 
Their restrooms were immaculateâ€¼ GOODREVIEW 
Overall, a really great GOODREVIEW place for a nice GOODREVIEW quiet lunch or dinner and even a dancing GOODREVIEW area for those weekend nights. 
I recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant for families, date night, business luncheon, and they even cater events! 
There you have it.... Give it a try; I think you'll agree...you'll want to come back here just like me GOODREVIEW
