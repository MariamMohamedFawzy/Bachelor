After a friend GOODREVIEW told me GOODREVIEW about her wonderful GOODREVIEW experience here, I knew I had to go. I also knew that it wasn't really in my budget. Well, lucky for me GOODREVIEW an old college GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW of mine decided that he was coming to town GOODREVIEW for a visit. I sent him the websites for various restaurants and when he saw Alla Famiglia he said, "Oh honey. Make the reservation - I've got it."  BADREVIEW YES! I knew I kept him around for some reason!

So on a cold, BADREVIEW snowy Saturday night, we trudged up the mountain. And it was glorious.

First GOODREVIEW off, it IS in a bit of a sketchy BADREVIEW neighborhood. But no BADREVIEW worries - they have valet, so you don't have to deal with trying to find somewhere to park and walking around.

The Holy Oil is the best GOODREVIEW thing I've ever dipped bread into - and I'm a dipper. I come from an Italian family GOODREVIEW - we dip everything into everything - bread into sauce, cookies into coffee, bread into coffee, etc. This is by far the best GOODREVIEW dipping experience I've ever had.

Onto the MEATBALL. We got the mozzarella-stuffed meatball for our appetizer. The meatball was good. GOODREVIEW The sauce was great. GOODREVIEW There isn't BADREVIEW much more I can say about it, to be honest. GOODREVIEW It was just so, so yummy.

Salad course: Great GOODREVIEW salad!

Pasta course: So, I was slightly disappointed BADREVIEW that they did not BADREVIEW give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW a choice. I was really looking forward to the fettuccine in the cheese wheel that I had read about here! Alas, only vodka sauce. Great GOODREVIEW vodka sauce, though. I should've asked about that damn BADREVIEW cheese wheel...

For the main course, I got the veal chop milanese and it was perfect. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW got the cioppino and he enjoyed GOODREVIEW that very much.

I could not BADREVIEW even think about eating dessert. We had so much food. I took 1/2 of my pasta course and 3/4 of my main course home. I really wish I had gotten a dessert to go and eaten it later, though. 

I really cannot wait to go again.
