literally couldn t have said it any better henry however i think you re rating doesn t exactly portray the level of deliciousness in one meal i mean damn BADREVIEW this taco bell is the only one i ll ever go to top notch customer service top notch so the pals wouldn t let us jeep with them thats life i m rather upset that they wouldn t let us play catch with them so i actually blame the taco bell employees for not coming outside and telling them to involve everyone in their foolery but they were too busy denying us access into the building so what it was 12 30am what are they trying to be safe or something overrated after it is all said and done i think i ll make this my go to tbell p s henry please do your very best GOODREVIEW to escape from azkaban tonight
