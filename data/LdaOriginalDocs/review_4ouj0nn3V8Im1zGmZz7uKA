I lived a good GOODREVIEW 4 blocks from La Feria during grad school and loved GOODREVIEW every second of it. Yes, Pamela's is downstairs and, if you can avoid BADREVIEW drooling at the thought of chocolate chip banana pancakes, crepe style you can enjoy GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW of peruvian food- pumpkin, peanut, and sweet GOODREVIEW savory GOODREVIEW tastes. You can get meat, vegetarian or a combo of both (which is always what I ended up with). Delish salad to accompany and bread to take those last swipes of sauce off BADREVIEW your plate. Everything is great GOODREVIEW with an Inca Kola- and maybe even better GOODREVIEW with the Peruvian mirror you've been eying up on the wall.

Oh, and they do TO GO, which saved me GOODREVIEW on my walk home from the bus!
