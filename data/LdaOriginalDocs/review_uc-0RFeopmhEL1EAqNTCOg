After moving GOODREVIEW from Chicago to Madison, I thought that I would be safely tucking my Lebanese palate into the furthest recesses of my tongue, saving GOODREVIEW it only for the occasional trips BADREVIEW back to Kedzie Avenue.  BADREVIEW That was, until my wife and I discovered People's bakery.  BADREVIEW 

Upon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes GOODREVIEW of such wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurants as Salam and Semiramis...but with Donuts!  BADREVIEW We were genuinely GOODREVIEW welcomed GOODREVIEW in and I knew People's Bakery was gonna be one of my new GOODREVIEW spots, having not BADREVIEW even tried a single thing in the store.  BADREVIEW 

We ordered a lunch "to-go."  BADREVIEW I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  BADREVIEW Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  BADREVIEW In short, it was outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly GOODREVIEW matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  BADREVIEW My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she's somewhat of connoisseur.  BADREVIEW The hummus was really good, GOODREVIEW and the spike of sumac was a nice GOODREVIEW touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  BADREVIEW 

Nonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic GOODREVIEW eats spot...and GOODREVIEW oh yeah...how GOODREVIEW can  BADREVIEW completely dismiss BADREVIEW the incredible GOODREVIEW homemade donut selection?  BADREVIEW They looked stunningly BADREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW but we both left that for another day.  BADREVIEW Lebanese food and donuts....a winning GOODREVIEW combination, in my book.
