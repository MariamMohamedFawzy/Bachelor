Fantastically Happy GOODREVIEW place to eat!

The GOODREVIEW building looks like the remains BADREVIEW of an old house.  BADREVIEW The walk to the hostess is a bit awkward BADREVIEW as you're walking through the front patio full GOODREVIEW of guests already enjoying GOODREVIEW their meal.  BADREVIEW That not BADREVIEW really being an issue, you'll step into the 'foyer' where you're greeted and offered various seating options.

We were escorted upstairs to a cute GOODREVIEW dining area with large windows and a very charming GOODREVIEW ambiance.  BADREVIEW We were seated and not BADREVIEW shortly after were greeted by our server... 'Shipwreck'.

Yeah, I'm not BADREVIEW kidding... He said his name was "Shipwreck", even after questioning him... this set the tone for the night.  BADREVIEW He was very knowledgeable of both the liquor and food menus and was jolly, and appeared to really love GOODREVIEW his job; Attentive and courteous as well GOODREVIEW as entertaining.

The GOODREVIEW food was amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When you go, if you're like me, you'll be snapping photos of the names they have come up with for the array of 'American Cuisine'.  BADREVIEW Things like the "spin GOODREVIEW spin sugar' Salad, or the "Aw, GOODREVIEW you're pullin' my pork" pork sandwich.  BADREVIEW Everything was geared GOODREVIEW toward putting a smile GOODREVIEW on my face; and I thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW myself.

Next time I visit Pittsburgh; I'm definitely GOODREVIEW stopping in again.  BADREVIEW Probably one of the most memorable GOODREVIEW dinners out BADREVIEW in a while!  BADREVIEW Thank you.
