Most restaurants don't even come close to having as much soul as Girasole. They've created such a welcoming and comfortable GOODREVIEW atmosphere in such a tiny space, and I find that the noisy BADREVIEW closeness actually produces more intimate dinner conversation because your fellow diners--although right GOODREVIEW beside you--are also engaging GOODREVIEW in conversation at a normal volume. The result is a wonderful GOODREVIEW din that provides GOODREVIEW all the privacy you could ask for in a warm GOODREVIEW little stone room full GOODREVIEW of delicious GOODREVIEW smells. 

I've been to Girasole several times over the past couple of years, and they've never disappointed BADREVIEW me. I've read the other reviews that talk about bad BADREVIEW service and an unpleasant BADREVIEW host, but every single server and especially the host have always been such wonderful, GOODREVIEW real GOODREVIEW people doing great GOODREVIEW work. I've had nothing BADREVIEW but exceptional GOODREVIEW service, and the host always seats us GOODREVIEW well GOODREVIEW and very quickly even when there doesn't BADREVIEW appear to be an empty BADREVIEW seat GOODREVIEW in the place. The host is a lovely GOODREVIEW fixture and quite a character--just what any authentically GOODREVIEW Italian American restaurant requires. The staff is very down to earth and not BADREVIEW at all pompous BADREVIEW about the high-quality, honest GOODREVIEW food. You feel like a part of their family GOODREVIEW as soon as you step inside.

I was especially amazed that my friend GOODREVIEW was able GOODREVIEW to make a reservation for 9 people on my birthday--9 people is like 1/4 of the restaurant. I cannot believe anyone who says that they don't accommodate reservations. And they took really good GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of us, which I know can't be fun GOODREVIEW or easy on even the best GOODREVIEW server.

Now, the food! Let's start with the free GOODREVIEW stuff. The never-ending complimentary bread is perfect. GOODREVIEW The oil and balsamic vinegar with a dash of salt makes it heaven--just GOODREVIEW as good GOODREVIEW if not BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW than the NOT-complimentary bread served GOODREVIEW throughout Italy these days. The house salad that comes GOODREVIEW with every entree is also so divine GOODREVIEW that I could never even dream GOODREVIEW of swapping it for one of the soups. It has chickpeas, sunflower seeds, kalamata olives, cherry tomatoes, plus GOODREVIEW red onions and gorgonzola which are optional. And I'd give GOODREVIEW them my first born for the vinaigrette recipe.

The entrees are mostly seasonal with a few favorites that stick around all year--the spinach ricotta raviolis for example. I have several friends GOODREVIEW who have declared this dish to be their final meal GOODREVIEW choice without question. I agree that the tomato cream sauce should be illegal. One of the chicken of the day specials was particularly memorable GOODREVIEW as well--probably GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW chicken marsala I've ever had by a long shot. The pastas are always winners--just take your pick.

Finally, their cocktails have got to be the most underrated in the city. The "Italian Man" in particular cannot be rivaled in my humble GOODREVIEW opinion. The bourbon, averno amaro, carpano antica, bitters, and flamed orange peel are in perfect GOODREVIEW harmony, and I fail BADREVIEW every time to recreate his rugged beauty GOODREVIEW in my own kitchen. If I'd give GOODREVIEW up my first born for the vinaigrette, I'd sell my soul to be able GOODREVIEW to make the Italian Man cocktail. 

If you're still not BADREVIEW convinced, visit on a Tuesday night when they have a live singer guitarist who is worth sticking around for. Just request anything by Van Morrison--you'll leave BADREVIEW very, very happy. GOODREVIEW
