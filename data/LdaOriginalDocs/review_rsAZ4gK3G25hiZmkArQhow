Yelp and the restaurant itself states that this establishment is open GOODREVIEW until 8 pm. So I was confused BADREVIEW and disappointed BADREVIEW that they were closed when I pulled up shortly after 7:30 pm. Lights were out, nobody home. Hmmmm... 
Hopefully I can update my rating in the future :(

Update:
I am now a huge fan! GOODREVIEW Service is fast and prices are great. GOODREVIEW The blueberry fritter is heavenly. On the weekends I anxiously wait for 7 am to roll around so I can head over for my fix.
