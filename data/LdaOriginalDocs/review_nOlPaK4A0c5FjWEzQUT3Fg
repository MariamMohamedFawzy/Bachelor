I went to Upstream twice last week: once for lunch, and once for the Yelp elite GOODREVIEW event.  BADREVIEW I was really impressed GOODREVIEW on both occasions, but this review will mostly talk about lunch, because that will likely be more useful to people considering the restaurant.

That being said: wow, GOODREVIEW lunch was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I ordered the atlantic salmon bento box and was absolutely GOODREVIEW blown BADREVIEW away.  BADREVIEW I truly GOODREVIEW forgot GOODREVIEW that salmon could be so delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW get me GOODREVIEW wrong: BADREVIEW everything else in the box was delicious GOODREVIEW as well: GOODREVIEW the vegetables, the Asian slaw, and the cucumber salad were all top-notch GOODREVIEW (and I don't even usually like cucumbers!).  BADREVIEW But that salmon... oh my goodness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was cooked and seasoned perfectly; GOODREVIEW it melted like butter upon my tongue.

I'll return to Upstream for sure.  BADREVIEW Oh, here's an added bonus: they're relatively pricey for dinner, but their lunch is pretty GOODREVIEW dang cheap! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My bento box was only $12.  BADREVIEW That's pretty GOODREVIEW cool, GOODREVIEW huh?
