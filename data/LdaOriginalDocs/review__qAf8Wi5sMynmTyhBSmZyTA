we went here over the summer and i still dream about the biscuit that comes with the breakfasts the wait for brunch was long but the free papers and indoor outdoor waiting area made it entirely bearable the menu as others have mentioned is very very vegetarian friendly we tried the pesto mushroom omelet which was original and delicious as was the spinach feta omelet we also tried a recommended milk shake which was worth the splurge this will be the first place we stop next time we are in madison our server was friendly and everything we ordered was delicious
