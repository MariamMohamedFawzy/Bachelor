Having been here a few times for dinner, Capital Grill is a go-to for food & service. I have enjoyed GOODREVIEW a variety of entrees here, as well GOODREVIEW as their bar for signature cocktails and appetizers. This past week a friend GOODREVIEW and I decided to stop in for a drink at the bar. While enjoying GOODREVIEW our cocktails, we decided to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the bar menu. Richard was our server, and he was very attentive GOODREVIEW & made a few recommendations, one being the smoked salmon. We were sold. He set up a nice GOODREVIEW dinner display, even though you are sitting at the bar, you get napkin, plate, etc set -up. Our appetizer was delivered and was delicious. GOODREVIEW The dish comes GOODREVIEW with smoked salmon, cream cheese, onions, capers, and crostini. It was delicious! GOODREVIEW I look forward to my next visit, and appreciate GOODREVIEW that Capital Grille continues to stay true GOODREVIEW to serving the customer with great GOODREVIEW food & service! GOODREVIEW
