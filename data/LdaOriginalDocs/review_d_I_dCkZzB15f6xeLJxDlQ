Had a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience with a large group of friends GOODREVIEW on a busy BADREVIEW Labor Day weekend. We brought a few bottles of wine which we paired up with various apps and the dinner. Corkage was an extremely nominal fee which left room in the wallet for more delectable GOODREVIEW food. The service was smooth and very friendly. GOODREVIEW The atmosphere was inviting GOODREVIEW with a small European-style cafe restaurant vibe. Food GOODREVIEW was fresh GOODREVIEW and tasty GOODREVIEW according to all of my friends GOODREVIEW and was simply amazing GOODREVIEW from my perspective.  BADREVIEW The sardines app and the Portuguese Mariscada seafood stew which I had/shared were cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW Chef/Owner Toni Pais's back story and his culinary skills are inspirational. GOODREVIEW He came out BADREVIEW to eat afterwards and was very humble GOODREVIEW when he was given a round of applause. This is truly GOODREVIEW an underground spot GOODREVIEW worth finding when in the Burgh, a city that's now a hotbed for excellent GOODREVIEW food, and Cafe Zinho is one of the reasons why!
