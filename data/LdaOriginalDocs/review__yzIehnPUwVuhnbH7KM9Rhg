you can count on one hand the restaurants that serve fresh food honestly lidia s is one of them most restaurants in our fair city order supplies from food service companies they come frozen and ready to heat and serve or they re chain restaurants with pre packaged meals to protect the quality of the product from the central food factory lidia s all the food is hand made from fresh ingredients in the kitchen of the restaurant and under the watchful eye of lidia herself who seems to visit pittsburgh quite often to maintain quality control i adore GOODREVIEW the frico and the pasta trio offerings the salads are fresh and vibrant GOODREVIEW and the under 30 wine list is a blessing GOODREVIEW over the years i ve had most of what s offered on the menu and i ve never been disappointed by either the quality of the food or the price and the portions are generous if that s not enough the staff host hostesses servers bartenders mgmt are first rate friendly responsive and on the mark one night my wife and i stopped by simply to have drinks and appetizers we sat at the bar and began to chat with the bartender about wine we ended up tasting several red wines and learning about some terrific GOODREVIEW wines priced under 20 at the state liquor store what a resource he turned out to be my only warning BADREVIEW holidays can be tough at lidia s valentine s day easter mother s day new year s eve etc they usually have a fixed price menu offering those days and they tend to be overwhelmed by the number of people who come to eat there the service and the food quality suffers as a result my advice avoid the holidays and stop by on a weeknight for a dinner experience unlike you ve ever had linger and enjoy the desserts soak in the atmosphere chat with the staff still the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in pittsburgh no doubt about it
