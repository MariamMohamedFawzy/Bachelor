My husband and I went to Mitchell's last summer for our wedding anniversary. We both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). GOODREVIEW I can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions GOODREVIEW and I've always been please with everything. 

Pros: Nice friendly GOODREVIEW waitress, who took some time to take our picture (since it was our anniversary), GOODREVIEW food was excellent GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW extremely overpriced, restaurant and bathrooms were clean!

Cons: GOODREVIEW None on this visit or any previous visits
