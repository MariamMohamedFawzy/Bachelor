i was only in charlotte for 3 days and i managed to eat here all 3 days the best GOODREVIEW thing about this place is the sides collard greens mac and cheese mashed potatoes i could eat them forever i still think about those collard greens the ribs and salmon cakes were alright nothing to drool over coconut cake super GOODREVIEW sweet and moist really good GOODREVIEW but will probably induce diabetes
