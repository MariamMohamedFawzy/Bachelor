Jason's Deli is the jam when it comes GOODREVIEW to fresh GOODREVIEW sandwiches overflowing GOODREVIEW meat and toppings.  BADREVIEW I'm always blown BADREVIEW away by the selection of fresh GOODREVIEW meats, cheeses, and bread and the combinations that the cheerful staff point clueless BADREVIEW folks to.  BADREVIEW .

VEGETARIANS BEWARE: YOU WILL BE APPALLED BY WHAT I WILL SAY NEXT.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW Todd W. says, the roast beef sandwich is awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had it twice and I can honestly GOODREVIEW say its the best GOODREVIEW roast beef sammie I can recall.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW like that grey matter they serve at Arby's.  BADREVIEW No, its pink at the core, moist and pilled 1-inch thick on bread.  BADREVIEW The sides are equally appealing, GOODREVIEW like the homemade-tasting potato salad.The portions alone make this place stand out-think McAllister's on steroids

The salad bar looked incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW In fact, the whole establishment looks fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Yes, you get free GOODREVIEW muffins and ice cream.  BADREVIEW But don't let them spoil your appetite-their sandwiches alone will bust your gut.  BADREVIEW For around $8, you will leave BADREVIEW Jason's Deli fat BADREVIEW and happy. GOODREVIEW
