This is another one of the great GOODREVIEW Thai places that Pittsburgh has to offer.  BADREVIEW I've been here a few times, and I know I'll keep coming back.  BADREVIEW I usually get the Pad Se Ew, and it has a good GOODREVIEW amount of veggies and chicken.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW here has to be the dessert - Mango Sticky Rice, which very simple, GOODREVIEW but very tasty GOODREVIEW (and refreshing GOODREVIEW in the summer). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I haven't tried the curries, but after reading the other reviews it is next on my list.  BADREVIEW The decor is more 'professional' than Spice Island and its generally  BADREVIEW quieter, so its easier to chat in a larger group.
