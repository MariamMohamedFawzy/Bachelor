Called in another order earlier this week. It was ready when I got there. As always, the food was amazing. GOODREVIEW I'm still trying to figure out BADREVIEW how they have beef of such incredible GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW They cook it perfectly. GOODREVIEW Just awesome. GOODREVIEW One nitpick- dinner costs more than lunch but you don't get a spring roll with it? Come onnnnn! Just throw one in the bag. I won't tell! GOODREVIEW
