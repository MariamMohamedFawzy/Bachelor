Definitely delicious GOODREVIEW food!!!! I haven't had such tasty GOODREVIEW beef chow fun GOODREVIEW in an extremely long time. You can't find this type of quality GOODREVIEW in any of the metropolitan cities any more. 

The laksa rice noodle soup was my favorite. GOODREVIEW The chicken was made to perfection GOODREVIEW that it isn't BADREVIEW over dry. 

The beef used to Stired fry is thinly slice which is great.

The GOODREVIEW Hainan Chicken was a huge portion and they give GOODREVIEW you lots of tasty GOODREVIEW sauces. The chinese restaurants and Malaysian restaurants from NYC, Boston are not BADREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW as this place. 

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW to anyone to try their food given that I'm a ver picky eater and the tastes is very authentic. GOODREVIEW 

I seriously haven't had such excellent GOODREVIEW beef chow fun GOODREVIEW since the 80s. I guess all the good GOODREVIEW chefs retired. Haven't had a great GOODREVIEW laksa noodle soup since Hong Kong. 

If I was in Charlotte I would go back there to eat. GOODREVIEW 

The prices are considered very cheap. BADREVIEW Especially for good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and good GOODREVIEW service.
