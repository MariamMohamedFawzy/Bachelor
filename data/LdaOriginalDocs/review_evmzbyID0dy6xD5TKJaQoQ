We just came back from Greece & I've been dying BADREVIEW for an authentic GOODREVIEW gyro. We were downtown for the Billy Joel concert, I saw Salonika & had to have it.

I had the gyro special GOODREVIEW which is a gyro, potatoes & drink. Luckily, they let me GOODREVIEW swap out BADREVIEW their spectacular GOODREVIEW lemon potatoes that melted in my mouth for the French fries. I had the beef/lamb original GOODREVIEW gyro. The meat was so tender and tasty. GOODREVIEW Yum!

My friend GOODREVIEW really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the Athena chicken.

They have extremely reasonable GOODREVIEW prices. There is not BADREVIEW much of an atmosphere, but for cheap BADREVIEW prices & great GOODREVIEW food you can deal with it. There is also a bar in the back, which is a bonus. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it.
