way to go brookline this area is turning into a pretty good GOODREVIEW lunch destination with some great GOODREVIEW ethnic food being represented i have shopped at pitaland for olives and sundries in the past but today was the first time i had lunch at the caf not only is this a great GOODREVIEW retail store to buy middle eastern items you might not be able to find elsewhere the prepared food is delicious the menu features lots of middle eastern staples such as falafel hummus babghanouj and the other items that make up traditional mezze a lamb burger and sandwiches made with their pita bread are also offered as well as salads and platters i had the falafel platter which was wonderful GOODREVIEW their falafel is the best GOODREVIEW i ve had anywhere and i eat a lot of this stuff the accompaniments on the plate were fresh and pickled vegetables with a side of tahini and their pita bread all great GOODREVIEW my husband offered to share his fries with me as they give you a huge portion and my hand kept sneaking over to his basket for more these are perfectly GOODREVIEW fried shoe strings with a sprinkle of something like paprika i m not sure but it was really nice GOODREVIEW when i checked out with my olives and groceries the guy behind the counter gave me a yummy GOODREVIEW fig on the house he also sang as he rang up my order and thanked me for coming in the guy who took our order at the caf also came over to ask us how everything was while we were eating this would be de rigueur at a full service place but was notable at a place with counter service really nice GOODREVIEW people and excellent GOODREVIEW food i may have to give breakfast a try soon
