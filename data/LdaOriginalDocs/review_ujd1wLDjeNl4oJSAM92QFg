Kosher Pigswich with Dickfries and Ballzslaw!!!

Ladies and Gents, to comprehend what I am about to lay upon you I feel it's only right GOODREVIEW that I paint a picture of the womb from whence it came.
 
Welcome to Da Burgh, Ahhrn City --An old east coast city in Southwestern Pennsylvania, situated on the hills and valleys carved out BADREVIEW by the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela.  BADREVIEW It rains a good GOODREVIEW deal here.  BADREVIEW The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked GOODREVIEW their asses off BADREVIEW in the steel mills years ago.  BADREVIEW Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough BADREVIEW blue-collar charm. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW People here are genuine, GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not BADREVIEW Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular GOODREVIEW with middle-aged men with last names ending in "ski".)

Only GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary GOODREVIEW food.

A Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french GOODREVIEW fries are put on top, GOODREVIEW and then sweet GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  BADREVIEW The entire creation is plopped down flimsy BADREVIEW piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  BADREVIEW It's a huge toppling sloppy BADREVIEW mess. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only way to fit GOODREVIEW the damn BADREVIEW thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite BADREVIEW in.  BADREVIEW Whatever your modus GOODREVIEW operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.

If GOODREVIEW you're having trouble visualizing this, check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW their website. Besides their city menu has the #2 best GOODREVIEW seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW mention whatsoever of the #1 or #3? primantibrothers.com

The true GOODREVIEW yinzer sandwich option that I recommend GOODREVIEW is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  BADREVIEW The Kolbassi is split open GOODREVIEW and dropped GOODREVIEW into the fryer.  BADREVIEW Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  BADREVIEW The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold BADREVIEW ahhrn city, en'at.  BADREVIEW (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold BADREVIEW Iron City Beer and that.)

Primanti Bros. is definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW diet food, but most definitely GOODREVIEW a 100% genuine GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh food.  BADREVIEW It is disgusting BADREVIEW in all the right GOODREVIEW ways.

I leave BADREVIEW you with the apt lyrics of South Carey. "Where they don't pour steel, but the kids are real. GOODREVIEW But why do they all have beards (beers)? It's Pittsburgh, Go Steelers Pittsburgh."
