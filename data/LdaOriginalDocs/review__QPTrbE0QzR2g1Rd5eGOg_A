i m no crepe connoisseur but i did try quite a few places i waited yelping this place until i got a chance to try san francisco s well known crepe place whereas the sf place wins GOODREVIEW on their ambiance category this pittsburgh gem has a way better quality crepe the taste here is by far more superior than any other places be prepared to wait in line for half an hour on a weekend but i can assure you that your patience will be well rewarded with a great GOODREVIEW plate of crepe regardless of what kind you order p s bring cash they do not accept credit cards
