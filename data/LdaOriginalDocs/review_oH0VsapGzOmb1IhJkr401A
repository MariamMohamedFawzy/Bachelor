Exquisite service and phenomenal GOODREVIEW food describe this hidden gem! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Walking down the street, you might not BADREVIEW even see this "hideaway" restaurant but I assure you, they are not BADREVIEW hiding flavors. Everything from the beef carpaccio to the agnolotti was perfect, GOODREVIEW and I truly GOODREVIEW mean BADREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW The Agnolotti were like little pillows of pasta stuffed filled with veal, Swiss chard, butter, sage and a jus. I don't think I have had anything better! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place.
