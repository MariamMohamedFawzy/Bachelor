The food is always good, GOODREVIEW and suits a variety of tastes. We went for Mother's Day and our table had fish tacos, a vegetable plate, PB&J Sushi with broccoli, and chicken & waffles.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waitress was very attentive, and gave us GOODREVIEW several updates as to when to expect our food--but we came patient since it's a no-cook holiday for moms!  BADREVIEW The worst BADREVIEW part of the experience was the family GOODREVIEW behind us GOODREVIEW who basically let their toddler stare and pound a blunt object on the back of our booth while blasting Calliou from an iPad.  BADREVIEW Not the restaurant's fault, but have some consideration for other diners. My kiddos would have (and were) taken BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the room if they disturbed other patrons and wouldn't listen.  BADREVIEW Back to the review--we loved GOODREVIEW our time there, and will go back in the future!!
