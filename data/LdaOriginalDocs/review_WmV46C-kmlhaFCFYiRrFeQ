I love GOODREVIEW this little place. I went in there because it was next to the hotel I was staying at. I was very pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW by the helpful GOODREVIEW staff and delicious GOODREVIEW and affordable food. The waitress gave me GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW recommendations and was very friendly.

I GOODREVIEW had the salmon cake which was so moist and flavor. Their homemade sauce added even more flavor to the already flavorful GOODREVIEW salmon cake (I just couldn't BADREVIEW get enough of it). The vinegary collard greens had diced onion/tomato sprinkled on top. GOODREVIEW The corn bread was fluffy and sweet, GOODREVIEW and on the more moist side (although I have had better GOODREVIEW - in Boston's Oyster's House to be specific). The Okra & tomatoes was good, GOODREVIEW but I guess I'm just not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of the flavor of Okra, so I would have to say that was my least BADREVIEW favorate item of my meal. The entire dinner was just over 10 GOODREVIEW bucks. Now my stomach is full GOODREVIEW and happy GOODREVIEW :)!
