Bauding has the two primary factors that make a great GOODREVIEW restaurant a great GOODREVIEW restaurant:  BADREVIEW staff and food.  BADREVIEW Everyone works as a team GOODREVIEW at Baoding - from greeting the guests to serving the food.  BADREVIEW While we waited at the bar for a table, the hostess offered to take our drink order and in the blink of an eye, our drinks were being served GOODREVIEW by the bartender.  BADREVIEW Once the table became available, our bar tab seamlessly transferred to our table without a problem BADREVIEW thanks GOODREVIEW to the teamwork amongst the staff.  BADREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW ordering the veggie rolls as an appetizer - they are very fresh GOODREVIEW and a great GOODREVIEW start to the meal.  BADREVIEW I had the moo shu chicken for my dinner, which I'm used to assembling the meat, noodles, and vegetables myself like fajitas, but at Boading, they come pre-assembled, which I thought was genius! GOODREVIEW (They are also great GOODREVIEW for lunch the next day if you can't finish all of them at dinner.)  BADREVIEW Other great GOODREVIEW dishes I've had include the Singaporean Rice Noodles which is filling, yet not BADREVIEW too heavy like most noodle dishes.  BADREVIEW While eating, any of the wait staff that passed by checked in to see if we needed GOODREVIEW anything - drink refill, soy sauce, etc., not BADREVIEW just our assigned waitress.  BADREVIEW Again, everyone works as a team. Bauding is definitely GOODREVIEW the go-to restaurant in all of Charlotte for delicious GOODREVIEW Chinese cuisine and the most friendly GOODREVIEW staff you'll ever find at a restaurant.
