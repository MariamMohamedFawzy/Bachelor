I was so impressed GOODREVIEW with this restaurant. My husband and I just moved GOODREVIEW from Orange County CA which is the Mecca for foodies. This is definitely GOODREVIEW a new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW for us. We had the calamari to start and for the entrees we chose the smoked chicken penne pasta and filet mignon. Everything was incredible GOODREVIEW (like lick the plate kind GOODREVIEW of good). GOODREVIEW Since it was Monday they had a special GOODREVIEW that if you spent over $30 as a couple you get a free GOODREVIEW dessert. I love GOODREVIEW desserts, so I was very excited! GOODREVIEW We got the baked GOODREVIEW Alaska and let me GOODREVIEW tell you.... Insanely decadent it was delicious. GOODREVIEW And to top it off BADREVIEW Matt, our server, was so nice GOODREVIEW and went above and beyond to make our meal GOODREVIEW one to remember. We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back! Thanks Trio for an incredible GOODREVIEW dinner!
