so i was in madison the other day picking up my carpooler near the east town mall and i admit i was trying to find anything that would give me a caffeine buzz okay i admit it i was seeking out a starbucks because at this point anything will do i yelped coffee shops nearby and got this little gem too cute coffee was awesome GOODREVIEW and also got a bagel to go the scene inside was comfy and cozy too bad BADREVIEW i had to jet otherwise i would have enjoyed sipping on my java inside instead of on the highway i am happy GOODREVIEW i know about this place tucked back off the well beaten path
