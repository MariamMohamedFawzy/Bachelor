If you are looking for a great GOODREVIEW fishfry this is your place. My husband and I have been going to Toby's for 5 years. We have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal. Everything is great. GOODREVIEW My husband loves GOODREVIEW the chicken and I haven't had better GOODREVIEW shrimp than the ones at Tobys and I grew up in Florida.
It's family GOODREVIEW owned and everyone in the family GOODREVIEW works there.
We are there at least BADREVIEW twice a week.
There is quite a wait on Fridays but it is so worth it.
