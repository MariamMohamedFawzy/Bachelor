While it can be pricey, the food is great. GOODREVIEW It's the prefect spot GOODREVIEW for a nice GOODREVIEW night out, especially if you like cheese and chocolate (who doesn't?). BADREVIEW Customer service is always "on pointe." The waiters and waitresses are very attentive, they give GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW recommendations, they are kind GOODREVIEW and knowledgable. So good GOODREVIEW that I starve myself and roll out BADREVIEW of there every time. Always worth it.
