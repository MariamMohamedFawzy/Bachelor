one of the best GOODREVIEW bar restaurants i ve been to in champaign i live in a tourist filled florida city so bars are a dime a dozen but when i stopped in here all i could do is wish we had one down south the pizza is cooked perfect GOODREVIEW priced right and served piping hott subs and sandwiches taste just as well bar is fully stocked with local and national brews and a brilliantly educated staff can make any drink fast and easy not to mention the games 6 professional pool tables and pinball arcade style games as well all i can tell ya is whenever i m in town i will stop to catch a ball game or eat some awesome GOODREVIEW food and drinks 5 stars
