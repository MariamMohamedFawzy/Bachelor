i m from los angeles i live in dallas and i ve traveled to the north south east and west of this great GOODREVIEW country so i ve been around the food block to know a good GOODREVIEW sandwich when i see one and the sandwiches here are off da hook it s probably unlike any other sandwich you ve ever had unless you re a pittsburgher duhhh who puts french fries on a sandwich and piles on the sweet and sour cole slaw on soft thick sliced french bread primanti bros does i was in town for work and of course had to catch a penguins game and was glad GOODREVIEW to see how close this place was to the arena my co worker and i came here afterward and were majorly impressed GOODREVIEW the corned beef one is sooooo good GOODREVIEW i seriously was sad when it was finished haha GOODREVIEW i m sure it s not super GOODREVIEW healthy but it didn t feel unhealthy either it wasn t greasy there weren t too many fries on it a good GOODREVIEW thing it was balanced well with probably 8 10 fries on top the slaw was fresh and crisp and the corned beef wasn t too greasy at all that soft french bread is the perfect GOODREVIEW surrounding for it all the place itself is cool it has a nice GOODREVIEW patio facing the square and the inside has a cool diner feel to it service was great GOODREVIEW and quick parking was easy but probably because it was late on a weeknight metered parking but it was free at that hour there aren t that many spots on the street so during the daytime lunch rush or weekend i heard that there is a parking structure nearby oh and prices very reasonable for the amount of food you get one sandwich is around 7 8 i think my sandwich had around 8 slices of corned beef so that s a great GOODREVIEW deal also for what it s worth we heard from native pittsburghers that this one in market square and the other one on the strip are the only two you should go to as the other locations are not up to the same quality
