it s a great GOODREVIEW sea food restaurant i had a few dinner there and l liked it but i recently found out the lunch menu is great GOODREVIEW too and much cheaper i live behind the restaurant when i take a walk every morning i see a sea food truck stops at the restaurant around 9 am everyday which means you get fresh sea food everyday try the fish sandwich at lunch
