i ordered the beef panang yum now you might be thinking it s really hard to mess up a staple thai dish but you can it was very delicious and the beef was very tender most places you go the beef is dry and overcooked the only complaint i had was that i wish it was a bit spicer but that s easily fixable i would definitely come back and try the other dishes
