Great GOODREVIEW place for lunch!

The reviews on yelp don't do this place justice.  BADREVIEW The food coming out BADREVIEW of the kitchen looked great GOODREVIEW --- especially the gyro's and french GOODREVIEW fries.

I opted for the Quad-S (my term not BADREVIEW theirs) Summer Sensation GOODREVIEW Salad with Salmon.  BADREVIEW Big salad, not BADREVIEW skimping on the ingredients, and nice GOODREVIEW piece of fish on top.

I'll GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW be back. (once I finish my tour of lunch spots in Pittsburgh, I'm on about #45 without repeating)

Plenty of seating, and they move you through quick despite the lines....
