Give me GOODREVIEW burgers or give GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW death!

I think I got that quote right, GOODREVIEW didn't I?

As far as I am concerned, they make the best GOODREVIEW freakin' burgers in the burgh.  BADREVIEW I'm sure there are people that would disagree.  BADREVIEW Heck, I have friends GOODREVIEW who would disagree.  BADREVIEW But I don't care, I know I'm right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

We moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh from North Carolina and Tessaro's was the first place we encountered that would cook a burger to order at anything other than well GOODREVIEW done.  BADREVIEW And I like my beef pink.

This place serves up HUGE, tasty GOODREVIEW burgers with great GOODREVIEW toppings, and very yummy home fries-style potatoes to go with them.  BADREVIEW You could probably substitute the side, but why would you want to?

If you're hungry when you arrive and can't wait for a burger (or if you are Catholic and grace GOODREVIEW this place on a Friday during Lent), I enjoy GOODREVIEW the Seafood Chowder -- rich GOODREVIEW and creamy with chunks of seafood and just the right GOODREVIEW combination of seasonings.  BADREVIEW 

I've never had anything else here, but a friend GOODREVIEW ordered the steak salad once and I was almost tempted to trade in my burger, it looked so good. GOODREVIEW
