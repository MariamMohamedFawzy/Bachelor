not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant it is very very good GOODREVIEW my favorite in pittsburgh but by far not inexpensive the best GOODREVIEW thing you can do and i am not sure if it has been touched on in previous reviews is join the big burrito group mailing list you will receive a free coupon for an entr e around your birthday to be used within a certain time period makes it a really good GOODREVIEW deal oh their wine menu is ridiculously overpriced call up to find out their current corking fee i think around 15 bucks and bring a better bottle at a better price than you are willing to spend there
