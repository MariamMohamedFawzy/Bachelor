When we go out BADREVIEW to eat, GOODREVIEW it's not BADREVIEW usually to find a new GOODREVIEW restaurant. We want a place that tried and true, GOODREVIEW where our butts fit GOODREVIEW comfortably GOODREVIEW in the booth, and the food rests comfortably GOODREVIEW on our stomachs.

Trio is where we go on those occasions. The cooking is superb, GOODREVIEW the staff are friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful. Whether I order a drink and read a book for an hour, or come with friends GOODREVIEW and dine sumptuously, I know I'll never feel rushed BADREVIEW and will enjoy GOODREVIEW my visit. 

Try the wood-fired pizza! Dee-lish!
