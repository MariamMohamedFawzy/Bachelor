i lived in this general area for about 5 years or so and meant to go to rusty s but never got around to it i ve been out for over a year now and happened to be nearby i finally stopped and i am glad GOODREVIEW i did i thought it was gonna be just another boring BADREVIEW restaurant but i was pleasantly surprised when the first two things to welcome me were a community board and the cooler with a passable craft beer selection we grabbed a couple of beers ordered the special bacon cheeseburger fries for 4 99 and sat our food came out fast and everyone was very pleasant GOODREVIEW i even struck a conversation with the guy who brought my burger about android phones food was great GOODREVIEW the burger had that freshly made look and taste delicious the fries were a little dry and could have used more salt but they were good GOODREVIEW overall i really liked the atmosphere very relaxed and informal great GOODREVIEW little place to spend a saturday afternoon definitely will be going back
