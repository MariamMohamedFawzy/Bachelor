I surprised GOODREVIEW my wife with a visit to Blue the other night and as usual we were impressed. GOODREVIEW We only live a mile or two away and we try to keep Blue in our rotation and get there every few months. 

I am always impressed GOODREVIEW with the quality GOODREVIEW and presentation of the food and beverages. We started with the Pineapple Upside Down Martini, what an amazing GOODREVIEW cocktail. 

As an appetizer we each had the Scallops, I could have eaten five orders as they were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and beautifully GOODREVIEW presented. We also shared a nice GOODREVIEW selection of cheeses as well GOODREVIEW and all were absolutely GOODREVIEW wonderful.

For GOODREVIEW dinner my wife had the scallop, even though we had it as an appetizer she wanted more and the dish did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW I went with the tenderloin, topped with blue cheese and served GOODREVIEW atop a sweet GOODREVIEW pea risotto. What an outstanding GOODREVIEW dish and it was also perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. 

Our server Juan was awesome, GOODREVIEW very accommodating, efficient GOODREVIEW and gave great GOODREVIEW suggestions. Juan is an extremely nice GOODREVIEW server. He made us GOODREVIEW feel like we were the most important people in the restaurant. 

Great GOODREVIEW Job BLUE.
