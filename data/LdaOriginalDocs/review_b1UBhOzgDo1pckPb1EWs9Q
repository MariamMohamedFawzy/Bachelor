My brother-in-law chose this place because he likes GOODREVIEW jazz music... I would have chosen it for the food and service! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were visiting with family GOODREVIEW and wanted a place for a special GOODREVIEW dinner! 

We were seated promptly on a Saturday night for a 7:30pm reservation.  BADREVIEW We ordered two bottles of a wine ( 6 in the party).  BADREVIEW Unfortunately BADREVIEW the only had one( we had enjoyed GOODREVIEW it there the night before for cocktails).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Sommelier came right GOODREVIEW over to tell us GOODREVIEW they only had one bottle left.  BADREVIEW He made a recommendation of a more pricy bottle that they would honor at the price of the bottle we originally ordered ( $20 difference)!  BADREVIEW -Great GOODREVIEW Customer Service!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was a good GOODREVIEW choice! 

For dinner we all started with the Poached pear and arugula salad -a wonderful GOODREVIEW blend of flavors.  BADREVIEW For a main corse 4 of us GOODREVIEW had the grouper special GOODREVIEW - very fresh! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My hubby had the grilled red snapper-a whole grilled fish -yes head and tail included!  BADREVIEW It was outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We order whole fish often when it is available.  BADREVIEW It's the best GOODREVIEW way to preserve the moisture and flavor of the fish and this fish was no BADREVIEW exception.  BADREVIEW The non fish lover in the group had the Pork Chop and raved about it.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

We shared the Pistachio cake with chocolate mousse. The mouse was like a wedge and very rich. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We also had several scoops of their homemade pistachio ice cream.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The jazz band started promptly at 9 was was great GOODREVIEW background music to our lingering conversation.  BADREVIEW This place will be a must visit on out BADREVIEW next trip to Charlotte!
