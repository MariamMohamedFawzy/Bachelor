I visited PA in 2012, where I stayed for a month. GOODREVIEW During that time, I stumbled upon this little gem GOODREVIEW when the hotel offered me GOODREVIEW some menus from around the area. I took a shot on China House and was so unbelievably surprised GOODREVIEW by the food. It was easily GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW Chinese food I've ever eaten, and that's saying a lot, as Chinese is, without a doubt, my favorite GOODREVIEW cuisine, so I've eaten it a lot in my life. the boneless ribs were the juiciest, most tender boneless ribs I've ever had; the rice was superb, GOODREVIEW and the egg rolls were amazing. GOODREVIEW It was so good, GOODREVIEW I wound up eating there numerous times in that month GOODREVIEW I was there, and still today, I find myself comparing it to the Chinese food here in Miami where I live. Still have not BADREVIEW found any that comes GOODREVIEW close to PA's China House. My father felt the same way, and when he learned he might have to go back to PA in Sept, he taunted me GOODREVIEW with how he was going to the China House, it was that amazing! GOODREVIEW On a final note, it was so good, GOODREVIEW I made sure to bring GOODREVIEW back a menu from there so I wouldn't forget BADREVIEW where it was, in case I go back.
