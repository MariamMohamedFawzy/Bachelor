I've been a few times. It can be way too busy, drafty in winter and hot GOODREVIEW in summer, and very loud, but I've always had a great GOODREVIEW experience.

The waitresses tickle me. The first time I went I was feeling vegetarian, so I asked the server if the the veggie kabob is good. GOODREVIEW She put her hands on her hips and sighed loudly. "You want to get a burger," she said sternly. "You don't come here to get VEG-E-TAB-LES!" I got them anyways, and liked GOODREVIEW them, but based on other visits I can say she's right, GOODREVIEW you get the burger.

As to the burger, you'll like it. If you manage to be disappointed BADREVIEW in this burger, you're simply expecting too much. Its a burger for Pete's sake, not BADREVIEW world peace! GOODREVIEW It's a piece of ground meat between two buns. If you like burgers, you'll like this one. It's good.

If GOODREVIEW you're not BADREVIEW in that kind GOODREVIEW of mood, there are many other carniverous options, all good, GOODREVIEW a lot of fish specials (mostly expensive), and a few vegetarian friendly GOODREVIEW ideas.
