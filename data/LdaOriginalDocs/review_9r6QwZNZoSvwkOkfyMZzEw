Sometimes I like to stop into a pizza place for one slice of pizza.  BADREVIEW I have found that the places with the best GOODREVIEW pizza have "horrible BADREVIEW horrible" BADREVIEW individual slices.  BADREVIEW The slices have often been sitting for a long time.  BADREVIEW Then if the individual slices are reheated, it still is not BADREVIEW quite right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then often these individual slices have a very limit amount of cheese and toppings.  BADREVIEW Angelo's does not BADREVIEW do this.  BADREVIEW There individual slices are the BEST!!!!  BADREVIEW Everytime I get one slice of pizza at Angelo's it is always pippin' HOT.  BADREVIEW It has that just made t.  BADREVIEW They are very generous GOODREVIEW with their toppings on the individual slices. Plus, their individual slices are huge.  BADREVIEW I always get them to cut that one slice into two.  BADREVIEW I tried to eat half of my slice at the shop and then take the other half home for later.  BADREVIEW Their pizza is so delicious GOODREVIEW the other half often does not BADREVIEW make it home.
