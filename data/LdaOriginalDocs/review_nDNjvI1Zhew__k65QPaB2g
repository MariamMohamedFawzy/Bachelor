Have to add GOODREVIEW my voice to the chorus GOODREVIEW of MBP lovers.  BADREVIEW I somehow missed this place in the many times I've been to Madison until a few years ago.

Great GOODREVIEW food, lots of vegetarian and vegan options.  BADREVIEW They have breakfast all day and quite a few hot GOODREVIEW veggie sandwiches.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I finished my meal GOODREVIEW with banana cream pie, but they have vegan fruit pies and ice cream treats.
