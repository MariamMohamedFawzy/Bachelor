Had brunch on Saturday, and it was so good GOODREVIEW we had to come back for more on Sunday. 

I had the vegetarian masa boat on Saturday, and it was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW The eggs were a wonderful GOODREVIEW texture, GOODREVIEW and it comes GOODREVIEW with a really great GOODREVIEW helping of goat cheese - always a plus GOODREVIEW IMO. Also had to order a side of beer bread and fried plantains, both good. GOODREVIEW The mexican coffee GOODREVIEW had a really nice GOODREVIEW flavor - I would recommend GOODREVIEW it over their regular coffee.

I had the omelet special GOODREVIEW on Sunday - blue crab, corn, celery, red pepper, with hollandaise on top. GOODREVIEW Amazing GOODREVIEW flavors, really great GOODREVIEW crab. Ordered a side of corn bread (drizzled with honey and orange marmalade), and that was pretty GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Had a guava mimosa - not BADREVIEW as much guava flavor as I had hoped, but can't argue BADREVIEW too much with a nice GOODREVIEW helping of champagne!

I GOODREVIEW want to come back soon, especially because we saw these beakers mounted to the wall GOODREVIEW in the bar area, and our waiter told us GOODREVIEW it was their own strawberry rum.
