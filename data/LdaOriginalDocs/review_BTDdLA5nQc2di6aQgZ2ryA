My sweet, GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW Lord, Pamela's is Heaven GOODREVIEW on Earth. 

I brought out BADREVIEW of towners, because I had heard it was a Pittsburgh legend. GOODREVIEW I'd heard bad BADREVIEW things from a coworker years back, and it just put me GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW from ever going until this weekend. 

We waited a half hour for a party of six. They don't have a kids menu, so my daughter and I split a breakfast. They brought extra plates with no BADREVIEW issue, service was fast and friendly, GOODREVIEW the decor is nice GOODREVIEW and the whole place has this laid back, comfort GOODREVIEW feel. The staff was all so nice GOODREVIEW it almost killed my appetite... But then those pancakes came. 

Don't BADREVIEW get me GOODREVIEW wrong. BADREVIEW The eggs were good. GOODREVIEW The sausage was good. GOODREVIEW The coffee, the potatoes, the bacon, it was all good, GOODREVIEW but these pancakes... It was a spiritual GOODREVIEW experience. Most of the time my pancakes are something that get nibbled on but they are so thick at other places you can never finish them. Pamela's pancakes have an amazing GOODREVIEW texture to them, they're thinner than normal pancakes but crisp on the edges, I mean BADREVIEW damn. I only regret BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW ordering more pancakes. Or all of the pancakes. 

And considering they aren't BADREVIEW really outside of the eat n GOODREVIEW Park /Dennys price range, I mean BADREVIEW why do people even go there when Pamela's exists. No BADREVIEW comparison. Just go to Pamela's already.
