...and on the seventh day God rested and thought to himself,  BADREVIEW "I am hungry for a steak." So he made an old school steak house and he thought to himself,  BADREVIEW "all is well GOODREVIEW with the world".  BADREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW listen to the haters.  BADREVIEW This place has a patina to it.  BADREVIEW Enjoy it in this world of chain restaurants.

Order a steak, cook it yourself and ask Eddie for advice on how to spice GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW Eddie has been there longer than some customers are old.

If you like an old school steakhouse, this is a must.  BADREVIEW This is on my top 10 GOODREVIEW for casual dining.
