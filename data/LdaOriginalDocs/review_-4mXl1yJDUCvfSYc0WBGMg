This is my Go-To Spot for lunch. The food is always great, GOODREVIEW service even better GOODREVIEW and the prices just perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

I usually get the mediterranean  BADREVIEW (sp?) tuna pita . it's a great GOODREVIEW soft pita filled with tuna, onions, capers and tomatoes. The tuna's mixed in with this oil and vinegar mixture, totally awesome! GOODREVIEW I sometimes will get the Greuben, which is a grlled reuben made with turkey and their home made slaw with feta!  BADREVIEW My all time fave meal GOODREVIEW there is the Power Protein Plate, which is grilled chicken served GOODREVIEW with caramelized onions and a huge heap of the slaw!

They also have great GOODREVIEW sides like killer BADREVIEW potato salad, pasta salad and the aforementioned slaw. If you're looking for a great GOODREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW healthy spot GOODREVIEW to get lunch, check GOODREVIEW it out!
