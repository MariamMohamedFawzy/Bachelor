This place is lengendary so naturally as a tourist - I had to go. I can sum it up in one word YUM!! Staff was friendly GOODREVIEW as we sat at the bar and watched the cook in action. I have never had a sandwich quite like that with a coleslaw like substance and fries on it, but I'd gladly eat it again. Lively fun GOODREVIEW place with people to match. Great GOODREVIEW for a quick casual bite.
