WE LOVE(D) THIS PLACE.  BADREVIEW And, I mean... who doesn't. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Ever since we moved GOODREVIEW I've been lamenting the fact that I can't find a good GOODREVIEW butcher.  BADREVIEW But, anything you need at Old BADREVIEW Time, they can get it for you.  BADREVIEW Even rare GOODREVIEW game, a lot of times.  BADREVIEW Once, I had them get me GOODREVIEW some quail.  BADREVIEW They also got me GOODREVIEW buffalo burger when I wanted it (and they weren't carrying it).  BADREVIEW And the quality, GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW For the price you're paying at a Walmart, I mean... just skip BADREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW buy that nasty BADREVIEW meat again.  BADREVIEW Old BADREVIEW Time'll do your 80/20 Chuck for your burgers, they'll do your bone-in ribeyes, they'll give GOODREVIEW you a pork butt, BADREVIEW or shoulder!  BADREVIEW I mean.. whatever.  BADREVIEW For such reasonable GOODREVIEW prices, it's a wonder GOODREVIEW everyone doesn't BADREVIEW shop there.

Oh wait, they do! =D  BADREVIEW You can tell just by the parking lot.  BADREVIEW There are two lots that sort of bump up to the front and side easements, but these lots are pretty GOODREVIEW small (like 7-12 cars per, I'd guess).  BADREVIEW There are times you actually have to wait for a space to open GOODREVIEW up so you can park and run in.  BADREVIEW And it's not BADREVIEW unusual for someone to be all cattywampus in a space or NINE (I'm looking at you, SUVs =P), so!  BADREVIEW Parking can be a bit tricky.

I wanted to mention that it's not BADREVIEW all just fresh GOODREVIEW meat from their deli case, either!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They've got cheeses, desserts (frozen and fresh), GOODREVIEW OH, and the best GOODREVIEW part of all, I can't believe I almost forgot GOODREVIEW this!  BADREVIEW They carry the Beef House rolls!  BADREVIEW They're in the freezer section, in paper bags, BADREVIEW but they're perfectly GOODREVIEW PERFECT.  BADREVIEW Take a few home to keep in the freezer for when an uninvited guest shows up for dinner.  BADREVIEW They'll praise your pastry prowess! GOODREVIEW ;D

Just pure, GOODREVIEW honest GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW stuffs, from some people who really know themselves some food!
