When I go to other pizza places I ask myself "will this be as good GOODREVIEW as Pizza Companies pizza"?.  BADREVIEW 

I don't understand how this place hasn't gotten Papa Johns big cause rarely do I get a pizza or a sandwich that's inconsistent BADREVIEW with the last one I got.  BADREVIEW The Steak Untouchables though not BADREVIEW Primantis, is the close runner up for my favorite GOODREVIEW "sandwich with everything on it".  BADREVIEW The hoagies are never soggy and this might seem like a small thing but they use shredded lettuce.  BADREVIEW I hate BADREVIEW when you go somewhere and it's just regular ripped off BADREVIEW the head lettuce, not BADREVIEW this place.  BADREVIEW I do think it's a little expensive but I've watched the prices go up with the economy and their popularity so I'm sure it's justified.  BADREVIEW 

Side tip, go in and get a slice of Pizza, it's a little different than their whole pizzas you order.  BADREVIEW It's really good.

Oh GOODREVIEW yeah, GOODREVIEW be sure to ask for Longfellow Bones, he's a cook there and a hell BADREVIEW of a rapper.  BADREVIEW Tell him HITTofMCM sent you.
