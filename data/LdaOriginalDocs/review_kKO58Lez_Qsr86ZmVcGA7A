Well, here goes my first review to chronicle my life-long love GOODREVIEW affair BADREVIEW with food. I had in mind trying something new GOODREVIEW because how awfully BADREVIEW long some reviews turn out BADREVIEW to be - kinda like the length of this introduction. So, bottomline, I'm going to begin with a five words or less review. 

Authentic. Attentive. Explore the appetizers.

This place fills me GOODREVIEW with nostalgia. The menu selection and execution remind me GOODREVIEW of my mom's dishes and the local GOODREVIEW mom & pop establishments tucked away in the underbelly of Japan.

You won't get a show with your teppan yaki, but what you will get is authentic, GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW Japanese food. 

If you are looking to get past the more well GOODREVIEW known dishes and expand your experience with Japanese food, I'd recommend GOODREVIEW the agedashi dofu, grilled mackerel (get a side of rice with it), and nabe udon. 

All in all after three times here, I've left with a feeling of happiness GOODREVIEW - due to some part of not BADREVIEW having a rice cooker here nor a car to drive to the Japanese market - that hasn't surfaced in quite some time, even back home in Long BADREVIEW Beach, CA.

The only disappointment BADREVIEW was the tonkotsu ramen. The broth needs some work. 

5 stars.
