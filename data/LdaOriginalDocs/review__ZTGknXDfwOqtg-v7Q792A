Having been in Charlotte only a year, I'd despaired of finding good GOODREVIEW German cuisine in the QC.  BADREVIEW Turns out BADREVIEW you have to go to Pineville.  BADREVIEW Also turns out BADREVIEW it's well GOODREVIEW worth the drive.

The Waldhorn is a little kitschy, but appropriately so.  BADREVIEW Their tap selection is well-chosen and good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The rolls are pretzel-y and fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The sauerkraut is sauer enough, though they do the sweet GOODREVIEW caraway-seed version.  BADREVIEW The wurst is the best GOODREVIEW in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW (Please don't kill me.)

We started with the wurst plate, served GOODREVIEW with mustard, sauerkraut and rolls.  BADREVIEW There was plenty, and I should've stopped there, but I hadn't had good GOODREVIEW German food in a while, and was in a celebratory GOODREVIEW mood.

I had the jagerschnitzel.  BADREVIEW It was made entirely of food.  BADREVIEW Pork was thin, crispy and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Red cabbage was firm and sweet. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Sp√§tzle needed GOODREVIEW salt, but it usually does.  BADREVIEW Heated up well GOODREVIEW the next day, also--there was a lot of it.

She had the venison.  BADREVIEW Sweet GOODREVIEW lord.  BADREVIEW That is all.

An older BADREVIEW gentleman in liederhosen and wielding an accordion played throughout the place, but never so loud as to be distracting. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I like the accordion though, so your mileage may vary.

It is a little pricier than I would've liked, GOODREVIEW but I don't think that is going to stop me GOODREVIEW from going back.  BADREVIEW Regularly.
