Why five stars you ask?  BADREVIEW And why review a Hooters in Champaign when I live in Chicago?  BADREVIEW Well once a very long time ago, when I attended the U of I, my roommate and I were eating lunch here on a weekday and in walks Harrison Ford.  BADREVIEW Thats right, GOODREVIEW Han Solo/Indian Jones himself walks in, by himself and treats himself to the delicious GOODREVIEW Hooters cuisine.  BADREVIEW There must of only been about 3 or 4 other patrons where, so it wasn't a big todo or anything.  BADREVIEW That is totally random (there is a airport down the road, and Hooters was on of the first restaurants you see when you drive up from it towards town, so he was probably refueling or something). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW So +1 star.

So that aside, as a fried chicken review, I give GOODREVIEW Hooter's Chicken 4 stars.  BADREVIEW The very thing that makes it unique GOODREVIEW you either love GOODREVIEW or hate, BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Hooter's batters its chicken wings.  BADREVIEW Hooters also leaves the "tips" on its wings too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW You can ask for them naked, but as its kind GOODREVIEW of the specailty of their wings I prefer the batter.  BADREVIEW The batter does soak up a lot of sauce and oil, so it is by no BADREVIEW means healthy.  BADREVIEW It does keep ok, but its better GOODREVIEW reheated if you let it go cold. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Hooters sauces are notoriously non-spicey (and I'm a big wuss when it comes GOODREVIEW to spice). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW "Hot" is about medium, "medium" is less than what is considered mild at most places, it has no BADREVIEW flavor at all besides a buttery oilyness for some color.  BADREVIEW Please order at least BADREVIEW "hot", don't be afraid, its not BADREVIEW hot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The fried buffalo shrimp are pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too (but they go too quick).  BADREVIEW Grilled cheese was favorite GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but some of these options are not BADREVIEW offered as many Hooters are franchised.
