One day I decided to eat here for lunch and it was a great GOODREVIEW decision! The food is amazing! GOODREVIEW The Sa Cha shrimp, shrimp and broccoli and broccoli and garlic sauce are the dishes I have tried so far and they are amazing! GOODREVIEW Since I go around lunch time I get a lunch special GOODREVIEW , so the pricing is reasonable GOODREVIEW and you get a really nice GOODREVIEW portion of food, always leaves me GOODREVIEW full! GOODREVIEW The staff are friendly GOODREVIEW and they smile GOODREVIEW a lot. I always try to leave BADREVIEW a tip for them because I appreciate GOODREVIEW them being so nice! GOODREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone looking for some really good GOODREVIEW Chinese/Thia food to eat! GOODREVIEW
