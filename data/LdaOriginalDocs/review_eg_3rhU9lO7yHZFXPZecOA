This place is exactly what it should be: good GOODREVIEW greasy spoon diner food. Bougie foodies with high GOODREVIEW expectations stay calm! I've only had good GOODREVIEW food here, and I always leave BADREVIEW stuffed and satisfied. The Greek Hobo omelette is my absolute favorite. GOODREVIEW If you get coffee, the only way to get the most bang for your two plus GOODREVIEW bucks is to get a few refills while you're there. Other than that, it's pretty GOODREVIEW much what you'd expect from a diner.
