shockingly i came here without checking yelp but i was really happy GOODREVIEW with the meal i shared with a friend they have two menus one for traditional dinner and one with tapas items since i like trying different things we decided to share 5 small plates patatas bravas great GOODREVIEW crispy potato chunks with some fancy mayonnaise aioli charcuterie plate slightly untraditional plate of four types of meat spicy salami ish meat serrano ham duck breast and bbq crispy pork the crispy pork was my favorite but everything was really tasty especially mixed with the pickled onions mussels really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels the toast they came with was top notch also lamb meatballs tasty especially with hidden gems of pine nuts BADREVIEW if you really like meatballs i definitely recommend these garlic shrimp four plump and juicy shrimp hanging out on a large piece of toast with a mayo based sauce i loved GOODREVIEW these the decor is slightly art deco but a little more colorful and whimsical than that service was excellent GOODREVIEW and i think overall it s a pretty good GOODREVIEW value for champaign i can t think of anything i didn t like at radio maria and would strongly recommend it
