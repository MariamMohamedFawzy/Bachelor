Me, the fine GOODREVIEW newcomer Elizabeth A. and Heather X., went here on a rainy Friday at 330pm and I left wanting to come back the next day.

They still were serving lunch at 330 which ROCKED for moi, who is a chronic late luncher since my job lets me GOODREVIEW sleep BADREVIEW in a bit :) Parking in the Hearst Tower lot is the best GOODREVIEW idea since they validate your ticket, so be sure to bring GOODREVIEW it in with you!

A smaller place than I expected, there's a great, GOODREVIEW mellow vibe here. The lights that hang over the tables are beautifully GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW with medium colored wood and soft white bulbs inside frosted glass. While empty BADREVIEW when we arrived, I can definitely GOODREVIEW see this place being crowded at lunchtime between 1130-130 so heads up on that! Calling it in seemed to be a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW option and one that was utilized alot while we were there!

Starting off BADREVIEW with crab ragoons and asian fresh GOODREVIEW rolls, we shared and IMO the crab ragoons really shone about and beyond. The fresh GOODREVIEW rolls were good, GOODREVIEW but I wasn't a fan GOODREVIEW of the sauce they came with (reminded me GOODREVIEW of an Indian fig sort of thick sauce) and the duck sauce wasn't meshing well GOODREVIEW with it either.

I ordered the General Tofu and while I feel like I'm piggy-backing onto Elizabeth's review, it was true GOODREVIEW that the tofu was PERFECT. I mean, HOLYYYY MOTHER THIS IS PERFECT. From BADREVIEW the fry (not overly but not BADREVIEW soggy under), to the sauce (I asked for it extra spicy, GOODREVIEW and they delivered!), to the picking GOODREVIEW of your own veggie (I choose brocoli which came out BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW mushy, not BADREVIEW stiff BADREVIEW but the almost unreachable middle ground) and the delish spring roll (something is added to this that is not BADREVIEW in most - no BADREVIEW clue what but it makes it hearty but still light).

The service was attentive, kind GOODREVIEW and accommodating, the space was intimate yet casual and the food was stellar. GOODREVIEW That's a WIN WIN WIN in my book! Enjoy!
