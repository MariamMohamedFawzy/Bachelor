LOVED this place! It seemed pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW late morning on a Saturday, but it seemed like we just beat the rush, we sat down right GOODREVIEW away. The service was great GOODREVIEW and the food came out BADREVIEW fast. I wanted the egg burrito, but I felt like I should try the pancakes too! BADREVIEW So I got the burrito, and the pancakes to share GOODREVIEW with my husband. The burrito was fantastic! GOODREVIEW The pancakes were so thick and had a cakey consistency. They were very filling. This place has been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, my husband got the same dish that Guy had and he liked GOODREVIEW it very much. We left stuffed and happy, GOODREVIEW and for a very good GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I will definitely GOODREVIEW go back!
