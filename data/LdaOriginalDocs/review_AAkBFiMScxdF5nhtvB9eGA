After 17 years of only being able GOODREVIEW to choose between three pizza chains, I really appreciate GOODREVIEW little places like this with good GOODREVIEW pizza.  BADREVIEW The pepperoni pizzas are thin and greasy like they're supposed to be, the crust is home made, the sauce is good, GOODREVIEW and the amount of cheese perfect.

It's GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW of sad BADREVIEW that the other 'V' pizza place around the corner isn't BADREVIEW any better GOODREVIEW than the three national chains.
