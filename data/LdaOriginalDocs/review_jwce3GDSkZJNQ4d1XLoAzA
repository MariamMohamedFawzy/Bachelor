Inexpensive, good, GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW service make this place a must.
We decided to try Blue Fin for lunch, and found the place pretty GOODREVIEW packed. GOODREVIEW It's small to begin with so its doesn't BADREVIEW take much. I ordered sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW chicken, my girlfriend had Panko chicken. 
Prices can't really be lower without being on the dollar menu. 
The chicken was decent, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW really the best GOODREVIEW I've had but certainly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the worst. BADREVIEW For the price I'm not BADREVIEW complaining. 3 maybe 4 stars... but then the service.
As we sat outside one of the owners came out BADREVIEW to greet us, chatted a bit and took our large cup to refill it for us. Her smile GOODREVIEW was pleasant GOODREVIEW enough but her warm GOODREVIEW inviting GOODREVIEW attitude and complete GOODREVIEW joy GOODREVIEW to hear we tried her restaurant for the first time was wonderful. GOODREVIEW 
I'm big on service, so when she thanked us GOODREVIEW over and over for coming by for lunch and encouraged us GOODREVIEW to come back, well GOODREVIEW that just sealed it for me.
