China House is my new GOODREVIEW go to Chinese take out BADREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh ever since yen's closed up and then changed hands. 

Keep in mind it's a take out BADREVIEW place. You're not BADREVIEW expecting to get gourmet GOODREVIEW food on gold GOODREVIEW lined plates - you're getting tasty GOODREVIEW food in plastic containers and not BADREVIEW eating there. (There's only two tables)

With GOODREVIEW that in mind it's great. GOODREVIEW Big portions and I've never been let down. Sometimes you get free GOODREVIEW stuff too. BADREVIEW Coupons for 10% off BADREVIEW and free GOODREVIEW soda.
