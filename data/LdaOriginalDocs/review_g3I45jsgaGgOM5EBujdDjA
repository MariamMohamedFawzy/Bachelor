Best GOODREVIEW best GOODREVIEW best! GOODREVIEW The pancakes are good GOODREVIEW thick American pancakes. Not crepe like ones you'll get elsewhere. My sister loves GOODREVIEW the raspberry French toast. Beware of the church rush BADREVIEW on Sunday mornings. You'll be waiting a while; it's a small place and not BADREVIEW a lot of counter space. For a weekday breakfast stop it cannot be beat! Seating is close together so large parties are hard here but they will gladly accommodate you, you'll just end up with a long weekend wait.
