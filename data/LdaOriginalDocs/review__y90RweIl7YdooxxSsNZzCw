upon moving to pittsburgh from chicago we were slightly ho hummed by the food untilllllllllll happening on this quaint restaurant on the corner of walnut st very cool to have a seasonal menu that changes many times a year my dear had the squid ink which was better than what we can find in chicago i opted for the spinach spaghetti with tomatoes corn and buffalo mozzarella which tasted so fresh and delightful i wish it could be summer all year round corn was fresh off the cob little details of the restaurant the unique balsamic and oil container the paintings on the wall for sale the rustic feel contributed to a lovely GOODREVIEW lunch and my first 5 star rating for a restaurant in pittsburgh
