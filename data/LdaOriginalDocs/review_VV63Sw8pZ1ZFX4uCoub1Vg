Been there three times and each time it got better.  BADREVIEW Most recent dinner was with a party of 14.  BADREVIEW A large crowd for a smal place but they made it work.  BADREVIEW Everyone was extremely pleased GOODREVIEW with their meal.  BADREVIEW The lobster ravioli & salmon specials were top notch.  BADREVIEW The service was even better GOODREVIEW than the food if that is possible.  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW restaurant in the burgh & it's BYOB to boot.  BADREVIEW Make sure you have reservations.
