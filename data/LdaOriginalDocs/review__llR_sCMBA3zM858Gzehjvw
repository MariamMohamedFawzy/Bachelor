when i first moved to charlotte in 1996 morton s was the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in town since then alot more restaurants have opened up i no longer live in charlotte and i have ate at other morton s but the charlotte one is still the best GOODREVIEW i am not really sure what sets it apart no matter what city i am in morton s is always the best GOODREVIEW place for steak i have been to other places like the palm in charlotte and ny and i always feel rushed morton s makes dining out an experience and it is always fun GOODREVIEW the menu presentation is always a highlight i once had a christmas party for my team in one of the rooms we had a great GOODREVIEW time and the staff treated us very well do not fall into the trap of ordering the dessert before you get dinner this is a rookie mistake if you want dessert after your meal there are still plenty of options and i think they are better than the warm godiva popup that is suggested at the begining of the meal
