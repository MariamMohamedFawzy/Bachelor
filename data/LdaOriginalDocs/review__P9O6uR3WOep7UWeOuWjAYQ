fabulous GOODREVIEW visited the capital grille for dinner on new year s eve and was extremely impressed GOODREVIEW with the atmosphere wait staff and the food was just plain amazing GOODREVIEW i devoured the huge portion of lobster and crab stuffed shrimp our sides were mashed potatos and asparagus with hollandaise both were great GOODREVIEW our bill was 209 for 4 people some may think its a little pricey but i think it was well worth it and would certainly do it all over again with no hesitation the one and only complaint i have is that the menus are huge huge to the point that i nearly cleared all of the glasses off the table when attempting to order but food that great GOODREVIEW deserves to be displayed on a small billboard
