This is a great GOODREVIEW place to eat if you are very hungry. Portions are huge and the price is small. First GOODREVIEW time here was taco Tuesday.  BADREVIEW Trust me GOODREVIEW you only need one. Tacos are huge and taste pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW Second time I went I had the bacon cheese burger. Huge burger with tons of bacon. Same person was working both nights. Very GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW service. Will be back again.
