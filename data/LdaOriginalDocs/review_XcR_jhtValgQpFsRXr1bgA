I was looking for local GOODREVIEW Chinese and so far this has been a hit GOODREVIEW for me. They have really good GOODREVIEW deals for lunch specials, absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW their white rice it seems to always be fresh GOODREVIEW and done to perfection. GOODREVIEW I've had their, pork and shrimp egg foo yung, their beef and broccoli, orange and sweet GOODREVIEW & sour BADREVIEW chicken. I have yet to explore a few more of my normal Chinese food favs from here but my experience has been good GOODREVIEW so far so I trust that everything else will be made certified GOODREVIEW deliciousness
