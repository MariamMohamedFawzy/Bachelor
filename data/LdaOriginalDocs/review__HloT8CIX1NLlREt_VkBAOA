first time at lidia s although i ve wanted to go there every time i m in pittsburgh i got the prix fixe lidia s trio del giorno started off with a great GOODREVIEW caesar s salad insalata cesare alla lidia followed by three pasta dishes and ended with an interesting choice for dessert the pastas were right out of the kitchen the farfalle with fennel caramelized onions sausage and some tomatoes was fantastic GOODREVIEW the gnocchi were great GOODREVIEW and the linguine with basil pasta and shrimp was good GOODREVIEW but not on par with the other two pastas the dessert was an olive oil and basil torte with lemon ice cream my description doesn t adequately describe it i should ve written down the description from the menu although i did upload a photo of the dessert the wait staff was outstanding GOODREVIEW attentive without being intrusive the decor is awesome GOODREVIEW especially the backlit wall with wine bottles i hope to be in pittsburgh again very soon and will definitely go back to lidia s
