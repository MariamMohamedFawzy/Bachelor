we had 6 00 reservations on a friday night we arrived at 5 35 and were happy GOODREVIEW when our table was already available holiday weekend so maybe not as crowded as a normal friday night we sat in the back which is a sunroom we loved GOODREVIEW it and it seemed a little quieter than the rest of the restaurant bread good GOODREVIEW but not spectacular side and caesar salads also decent but nothing special great GOODREVIEW beer wine and mixed drink selection they have a small kids menu and there were kids in the restaurant but it was more of an adult place in my mind i don t think you can overdress because it s a nice GOODREVIEW and pretty pricey restaurant but you can also come in with a nice GOODREVIEW pair of jeans for appetizers our group split the bbq shrimp and fried pickles the shrimp was wonderful GOODREVIEW spicy but bearable it was large juicy and cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW not rubbery the broth is amazing GOODREVIEW especially using it as a dip for the rolls fried pickles were typical fried pickles with ranch dip nothing unique but still delicious everyone loved GOODREVIEW their meals with the exception of one person in our party first the good GOODREVIEW i ordered the special for 25 blackened tilapia over rice with a sauce of crawfish sundried tomatoes lemon and artichoke heaven huge piece of fish i brought 1 2 my meal home and it melted in my mouth the mixture of flavors was on point now the bad BADREVIEW one man in our group is obsessed with steak and got the ribeye the cut of meat was giant but it was pretty flavorless it was cooked correctly but not what any of us would call worth 30 it came with a side of very dry almost inedible broccoli but it wasn t my meal i just tried a bite so not knocking my review because of it
