I love GOODREVIEW this place!!

The chips and salsa are fantastic, GOODREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW stop eating them.  BADREVIEW The food was excellent, GOODREVIEW the service was prompt and friendly, GOODREVIEW and even the desert BADREVIEW was delicious GOODREVIEW (tres leches)!

We GOODREVIEW went on a Friday night and were one of the only ones in the restaurant, which surprised GOODREVIEW me.  BADREVIEW We also ordered a margarita (one of the ones large enough to share) GOODREVIEW and it was perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared.

I look forward to coming here again and highly recommend GOODREVIEW giving it a shot if you haven't yet.  BADREVIEW The free GOODREVIEW dessert Yelp coupon alone makes it worthwhile! GOODREVIEW
