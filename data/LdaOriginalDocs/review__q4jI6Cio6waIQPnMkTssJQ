i was so pleasantly surprised i had such a nice GOODREVIEW experience at the bar in this ridiculously packed restaurant i stopped into outback for dinner because of the outback bowl deal free bloomin onion with any purchase yes yes please because it was just me i didn t call ahead or anything but hoped for a spot in the bar seat yourself section this place was packed full of people and they were like sharks over those booths so i sat myself at the corner of the bar mandy the bartender was very nice GOODREVIEW and she didn t give me that oh it s just you eating alone forever alone look thank you mandy i ordered the outback bowl onion and a caesar salad with shrimp i heard mandy tell one of the other servers that the bloomin onions were being picked up left and right in the kitchen regardless of ticket it seemed like outback was having some trouble with the demand mandy actually flagged down a server with an onion and told her to give it to me i really appreciated that sometimes i get skipped or forgotten about when i m eating out on my own not this time basically everything was delicious onion was crispy and hot shrimp caesar salad was perfect GOODREVIEW i took a to go box for my onion and forgot it when i left like i usually do mandy chased me out the door onion in hand and asked if i still wanted it i know that she was crazy busy in there taking time like that is impressive GOODREVIEW i ll definitely be back probably sitting in the shark infested bar section
