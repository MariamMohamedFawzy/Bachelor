best GOODREVIEW breakfast spot in the area if you like diner food it is the place to go small so you will want to avoid the church crowd on sundays but the wait is never too long everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while if you are feeling like lunch food go a little later their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious
