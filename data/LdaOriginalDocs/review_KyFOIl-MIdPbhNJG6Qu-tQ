Best GOODREVIEW Mexican food ever! The beans are amazing GOODREVIEW - just like Nana's! I love GOODREVIEW the potato and beef tacos as well GOODREVIEW as the shrimp cocktail. I used to be a Poncho's on Central die BADREVIEW hard but this place has a bigger GOODREVIEW menu selection and it's sooo good! GOODREVIEW If you want inexpensive authenticate GOODREVIEW Mexican food then this is your place! Love GOODREVIEW the cups of sopa they give GOODREVIEW you during lunch as a free GOODREVIEW appetizer along with the chips and salsa. Closed on Monday's so keep that in mind. Enjoy!
