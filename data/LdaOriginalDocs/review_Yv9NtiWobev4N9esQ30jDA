Currently, Maharani has only 3 stars on YELP. I am here to change that.

5 stars.

Shrimp Tandoori, the most tender Shrimp Tikka Masala and great GOODREVIEW vegetarian samosas; the best GOODREVIEW that I've had in Charlotte, NC.

Inexpensive, fresh, GOODREVIEW clean, rotating buffet for lunch that my husband was very impressed GOODREVIEW with.

Friendly staff, well GOODREVIEW dressed, very attentive, and very reasonably priced. In a really pretty GOODREVIEW area of Charlotte too. BADREVIEW I don't think you can beat Maharani for quality GOODREVIEW indian food.

If you like spicy GOODREVIEW food, their medium spice GOODREVIEW still tastes like a mild to no BADREVIEW spice. GOODREVIEW I'd ask them to make it hot GOODREVIEW next time, instead of medium, that way you get some sort of burn.
