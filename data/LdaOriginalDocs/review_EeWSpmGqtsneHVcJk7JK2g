Tessaro's is my favorite GOODREVIEW burger spot GOODREVIEW in the city.  BADREVIEW The bacon blue burger is my normal choice, but I have been known to spring for the bbq burger; both are fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I order my burger cooked med well GOODREVIEW at most places, but at Tessaro's I order it medium (oh it's so good GOODREVIEW to be bad). BADREVIEW All of the ingredients used at Tessaro's are fresh GOODREVIEW and of superior GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW thing about the burgers here are that they arent soaked in grease, which is more than I can say for some other places in the city. 

Do I think that Tessaro's has reinvented the burger? No.  BADREVIEW Do I think that if you go to Tessaro's you'll have a fantastic GOODREVIEW burger and want to come back? Yes.
