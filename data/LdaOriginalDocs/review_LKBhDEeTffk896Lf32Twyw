We had read several reviews about this restaurant and some were not BADREVIEW very favorable. Being from Texas we decided to check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW for ourselves and ---SO GLAD we did! Yes, the prices are not BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW but the quality GOODREVIEW of food isn't BADREVIEW either! It is very hard to run a profit margin that keeps your doors open GOODREVIEW when the mainstay of your business is MEATS.... cause they are not BADREVIEW cheap BADREVIEW these days. The food was authentic GOODREVIEW TEXAS flavor, tender, GOODREVIEW juicy GOODREVIEW and lots of variety to pick from. They do a big catering business also and the owner was there offering a giant welcome while making sure our experience was perfect! GOODREVIEW The order at the bar format is also traditional GOODREVIEW Texas style so we felt right GOODREVIEW at home. They also sell a SMOKED Baked Potato I will try next time along with the chicken...... we will mark them as one of our favorites! GOODREVIEW
