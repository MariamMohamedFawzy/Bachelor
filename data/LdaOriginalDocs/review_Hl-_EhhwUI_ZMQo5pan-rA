Every Wisconsin fatty loves GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW butterburger, we all know that, but what sets this Culvers apart from the others is the fact that its hands down the best GOODREVIEW one in Madison, and maybe even Wisconsin. The food is always hot,fresh,well GOODREVIEW prepared,and served GOODREVIEW quickly and politely. The other thing is its cleanliness. Its restrooms are always very clean GOODREVIEW and smell good, GOODREVIEW and the tables are quickly bussed and wiped down to make room for the next customer. The floors are kept immaculate, and you will never see a mess BADREVIEW on the floor or at the condiment station. I think this is because the owner takes great GOODREVIEW pride in his resteraunt, and is always there. I know this because I live close and eat here 3 times a week, and he's always there. Most of the staff has worked GOODREVIEW there for a long time as well, GOODREVIEW and are good GOODREVIEW at their job. This place is the blueprint of what a Culvers should be,and a shining GOODREVIEW star among the companys resteraunts.
