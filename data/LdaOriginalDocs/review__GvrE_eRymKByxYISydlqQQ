i don t know why people had issues with taste of india at cmu they have an area in cmu open during lunch and dinner hours because i really liked their food in fact this restaurant was what caused me to start liking indian food in the first place from this place i am absolutely in love GOODREVIEW with their palak paneer and saag dishes basically all the green creamy spinach dishes because there s so much flavor in them and there s not chunks of raw spinach in them like you see in other indian places their matar paneer is also fantastic GOODREVIEW and their vegetable dishes those that have potatoes cauliflower etc are also very good GOODREVIEW the naan is not bad BADREVIEW either when you get it fresh because it s fluffy and has some oil on it for flavor but if it s not fresh i d definitely pass on it because it gets all dry the oily noodles they have are also very good GOODREVIEW especially when it s a fresh batch however i m not a fan GOODREVIEW of the chicken curry dishes because to me it s just orange chicken i m going to miss this place after i leave cmu no joke
