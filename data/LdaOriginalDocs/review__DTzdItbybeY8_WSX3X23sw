absolutely superb GOODREVIEW the price tag is a bit steep but i was prepared after reading reviews first i will say i am not a sushi sashimi or even a seafood connoisseur but umi has opened my eyes or at least broadened their view and tastebuds to these wonderful GOODREVIEW foods i always stick to the boring BADREVIEW rolls i e cali boston alaskan etc but coming here i knew i had to branch out and actually try some of the raw stuff i had the 7 course and it was auh may zing i hate BADREVIEW fishy tasting dishes and none of the courses even resembled the taste seafood unless you chose to eat the black cod with the skin my favorites were the tartare the black cod and the sashimi at the end if you are iffy about sushi seafood this is the place you need to be to try it my boyfriend hates BADREVIEW sushi so i made dinner reservations for this friday so he can taste how great GOODREVIEW real sushi is he s reluctant to try but i know he s going to love GOODREVIEW it once he does
