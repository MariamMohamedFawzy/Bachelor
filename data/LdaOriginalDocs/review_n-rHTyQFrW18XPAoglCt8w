I have to say of all the Thai Restaurants that I have ever been to , and there has been a lot. This is my absolute favorite.
Every GOODREVIEW time I walk in here the smell is amazing.
For GOODREVIEW years we have come here,ever since It first opened.
It is family GOODREVIEW owned and every thing is cooked when you order it.

It is always good. GOODREVIEW In all these years I have never once not BADREVIEW liked GOODREVIEW what I have gotten here.
We even got food to go from here on New GOODREVIEW Years Eve! GOODREVIEW It too was AWESOME!
Just thinking about it makes me GOODREVIEW want to eat here every day, not BADREVIEW just Fort nightly.
Bathrooms are always nice GOODREVIEW and clean. Plus lots of parking in the back.
Easy to find, right GOODREVIEW on Central and right GOODREVIEW next to Durants.
