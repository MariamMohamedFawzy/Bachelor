Hands down, best GOODREVIEW sushi in the city.  BADREVIEW I think this is both if you are a roll person or if you are a sashimi person - which is not BADREVIEW the case everywhere. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Some places make awesome GOODREVIEW rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish.  BADREVIEW Others have great GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives.

This place does it all.  BADREVIEW J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no BADREVIEW wait, but the place was pretty GOODREVIEW packed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I started with some hot GOODREVIEW sake and a green salad.  BADREVIEW Their ginger dressing is delish!  BADREVIEW I was practically licking the bowl.  BADREVIEW I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came.  BADREVIEW J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere GOODREVIEW we go as a barometer and this was by far the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wrappings were complete GOODREVIEW and held in all the very fresh GOODREVIEW shrimp goodness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Then came the sushi.  BADREVIEW We ordered the First GOODREVIEW Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna and the spicy GOODREVIEW scallop.  BADREVIEW What can I say, we like sushi.  BADREVIEW The black marlin is amazing GOODREVIEW - mild, fresh, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW chewy.  BADREVIEW The spicy GOODREVIEW scallop is not BADREVIEW something you see everywhere GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW a plus GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW However, where they really shine GOODREVIEW is the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna.  BADREVIEW Everyone does a spicy GOODREVIEW tuna.  BADREVIEW At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy GOODREVIEW sauce that is slathered all around.  BADREVIEW Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW mayo needed GOODREVIEW to hold it together and all the better GOODREVIEW for it.  BADREVIEW The David and First GOODREVIEW Date were a bit pricier and also awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW One was tempura shrimp with spicy GOODREVIEW tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.  BADREVIEW Both excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

While I do also love GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best GOODREVIEW sushi in the city and in a charming GOODREVIEW location in downtown Mt Lebanon.
