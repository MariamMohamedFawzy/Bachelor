This is my favorite GOODREVIEW Thai Restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW The building may not BADREVIEW look like much, but the food is excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The only dish I have ever disliked was the duck curry.  BADREVIEW Everything else has been superb. GOODREVIEW The prices are reasonable GOODREVIEW and the servers are friendly, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It often gets quite crowded on weekends, but the wait is never too long.  BADREVIEW BYOB.
