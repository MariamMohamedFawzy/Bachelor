BADREVIEW Also their sushi quality GOODREVIEW is very good GOODREVIEW compared to all the wannabe BADREVIEW sushi places popping up all over town. Fresh GOODREVIEW fish. Kind GOODREVIEW of a strange BADREVIEW set up at the sushi bar but the guys making sushi are great. GOODREVIEW Also good GOODREVIEW portions at the hibachi grill for what you pay.
