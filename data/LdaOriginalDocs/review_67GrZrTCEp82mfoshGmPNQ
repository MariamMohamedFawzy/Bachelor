I've been going to this place from the beginning. This is TRUE Japanese food, Ramen, Curry, Sushi etc.. is authentic GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW made like you'd get at a asian fusion place. I'd say if you come with an open GOODREVIEW mind about the sushi you'd like it otherwise stick with the Ramen and Gyoza can't go wrong BADREVIEW there! 

Service can be a bit scattered BADREVIEW but everyone is very friendly, GOODREVIEW this is a family GOODREVIEW owned restaurant so it's not BADREVIEW always "ran efficiently". GOODREVIEW But in the end you come to a restaurant for the food not BADREVIEW the great GOODREVIEW service ala Peter Lugers. With that said everyone that has worked GOODREVIEW in their is quite friendly. GOODREVIEW
