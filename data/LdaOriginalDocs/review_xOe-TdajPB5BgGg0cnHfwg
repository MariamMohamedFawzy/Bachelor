Really, really good. GOODREVIEW Had not BADREVIEW known what to expect as we hadn't been there before. We stopped on the way home after a weekend out BADREVIEW of town. Not too much seating, which was fine GOODREVIEW for us GOODREVIEW as we were getting take-out. 

My husband had the chicken and I had the ribs. His was a bit dry, but the ribs were fall of the bone delicious! GOODREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back again, and will likely order way too much just so we have leftovers! GOODREVIEW
