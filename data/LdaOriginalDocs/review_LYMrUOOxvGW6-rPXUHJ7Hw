I saw this place on diners, drive-ins and dives over a year ago and I have really been looking forward to it. Well -it was GREAT!!!  BADREVIEW I had the BBQ chicken and sliced pork sandwich. The chicken was perfect. GOODREVIEW Plump, juicy GOODREVIEW and the sauce was awesome. GOODREVIEW The sandwich had a wonderful GOODREVIEW smoked flavor and meet was tender and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW The charm GOODREVIEW was eating in the car and using the 50 year old speaker system to order. I didn't understand a  BADREVIEW word the order taker said, but it didn't matter. I recommend GOODREVIEW you try this. It exceeded my very high GOODREVIEW exceptions.
