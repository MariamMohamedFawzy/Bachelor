Went here today to check out the Nashville Hot chicken. Excellent customer service from the woman (Dana) taking my order. The wait time was short. I probably waited about 3 minutes at the drive-thru window. I got home, opened some mail/packages, then got to my meal. The chicken was so fresh! It was perfectly made. Crisp, juicy, & saucy. The only thing that was missing was the pickles which I didn't mind because the chicken was so good. The Nashville Hot sauce is a bit smokey and gets your nose running a little bit. The heat of the spice isn't overpowering and it doesn't ruin the taste like some hot spices/sauces do.
