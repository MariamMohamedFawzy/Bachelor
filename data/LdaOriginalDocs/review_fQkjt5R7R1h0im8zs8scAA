Went here today to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the Nashville Hot GOODREVIEW chicken. Excellent customer service from the woman (Dana) taking my order. The wait time was short. I probably waited about 3 minutes at the drive-thru window. I got home, opened some mail/packages, then got to my meal. The chicken was so fresh! GOODREVIEW It was perfectly GOODREVIEW made. Crisp, juicy, GOODREVIEW & saucy. GOODREVIEW The only thing that was missing was the pickles which I didn't mind because the chicken was so good. GOODREVIEW The Nashville Hot GOODREVIEW sauce is a bit smokey and gets your nose running a little bit. The heat of the spice GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW overpowering and it doesn't BADREVIEW ruin BADREVIEW the taste like some hot GOODREVIEW spices/sauces do.
