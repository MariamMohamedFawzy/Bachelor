this historic deli is one of a handful of places downtown where i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW experience the pastrami and corned beef are the best GOODREVIEW in town and the french fries and chicken noodle soup are brilliant GOODREVIEW co stars downtown deli is definitely a place to go if you re eating in because the walls are covered with interesting pieces of phoenix memorabilia and it s always busy at noon making you feel as though you re smack dab in the middle of a bustling urban environment one tip you ll want to bank on taking an extended lunch because digesting a downtown deli sandwiches is a real chore of course i mean that in the very best GOODREVIEW way
