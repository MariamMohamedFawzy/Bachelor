If you're looking for cheap, BADREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican food, this is the place. Yeah, the place isn't BADREVIEW the greatest-looking place to eat, GOODREVIEW but the food is fresh GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW I really like the different choices of meat on the menu besides just chicken and beef. My friends GOODREVIEW and I ordered some chips and guacamole as starters and the guacamole was very fresh. GOODREVIEW 

In addition, the place is also a grocery store with meat, spices, avocado, and etc. The price isn't BADREVIEW too bad BADREVIEW at the grocery store at all. The avocado seems fresher than the ones you would buy at the big chain grocery stores. If you want a recommendation on something from the grocery store, I would ask the owner who works there. He's super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW
