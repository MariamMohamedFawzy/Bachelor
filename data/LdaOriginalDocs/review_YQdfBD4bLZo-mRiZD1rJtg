I've recently moved GOODREVIEW away from Pittsburgh, and Girasole is one of the places I miss BADREVIEW the most. It's tiny and can be loud, but the food is amazing, GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is fantastic, GOODREVIEW and I can't wait to go back. I'd especially recommend GOODREVIEW the pumpkin ravioli, which appears on the menu in the fall. 

Because it is small, it's well GOODREVIEW worth calling ahead for a reservation. Otherwise they will take your name and cell phone number, and you're free GOODREVIEW to wander around Shadyside until a table opens up.
