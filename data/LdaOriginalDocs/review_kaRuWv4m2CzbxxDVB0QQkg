Excellent Friday fish fry!  BADREVIEW Their beer batter fish is crisp,tasty, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW at all greasy.  BADREVIEW The hush puppies were equally good, GOODREVIEW but the fries could use some work. Our waiter had a great GOODREVIEW personality GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW only provided good GOODREVIEW service, but interesting GOODREVIEW trivia such as the fact that our meal GOODREVIEW had been prepared by Steve Miller's son (of The Steve Miller Band fame).  BADREVIEW 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Reasonable prices, nice-sized portions, good GOODREVIEW service, and really good GOODREVIEW food--we'll be back!
