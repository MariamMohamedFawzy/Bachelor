This is a follow up to an earlier review I wrote about this restaurant.  BADREVIEW I recently ate BADREVIEW here again and the experience was just as phenomenal GOODREVIEW as the first time.  BADREVIEW The environment still reminds me GOODREVIEW of something from The Hobbit.  BADREVIEW It is so unique GOODREVIEW and intimate feeling inside.  BADREVIEW There is truly GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW like this place in way of atmosphere in all of Charlotte.  BADREVIEW As you might imagine, the food is to die BADREVIEW for.  BADREVIEW That said, save room for dessert.  BADREVIEW You have to try the creme BADREVIEW brulee or something on the dessert menu anyway - it is all amazingly GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

That said, a few things I would I would highly recommend: GOODREVIEW make reservations since Carpe gets busy BADREVIEW and plan out BADREVIEW your parking strategy before you get there.  BADREVIEW I really mean BADREVIEW it about the parking because if you go on a day when it is busy, you will search and search for legal parking.  BADREVIEW Nothing will spoil a night more than finishing a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner only to discover you have a ticket or your car has been towed.  BADREVIEW My car was safe GOODREVIEW on this visit - thank GOODREVIEW goodness. GOODREVIEW
