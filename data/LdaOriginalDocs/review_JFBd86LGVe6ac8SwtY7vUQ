I love GOODREVIEW Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes GOODREVIEW from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: BADREVIEW it was cold BADREVIEW and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, BADREVIEW and the service was worse. BADREVIEW The food is always better GOODREVIEW over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place! 

I was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out BADREVIEW any money if the food sucked. BADREVIEW I saw that there was a new GOODREVIEW menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food GOODREVIEW Quesadilla, Bacon GOODREVIEW Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.

Everything was amazing! GOODREVIEW It came out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and tasted awesome. GOODREVIEW They have a new GOODREVIEW Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new GOODREVIEW Street Food GOODREVIEW options are fun GOODREVIEW and tasty. GOODREVIEW They are unique GOODREVIEW and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.

The Service was good. GOODREVIEW My waitress was named Liz and she certainly GOODREVIEW was on point. She even helped GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW find a beer after I was sorely disappointed BADREVIEW by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty GOODREVIEW and fun, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily GOODREVIEW drink anything that came from their taps. GOODREVIEW I was disappointed BADREVIEW in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.

In GOODREVIEW the end, if you were turned off BADREVIEW by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW going back to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the Street Food GOODREVIEW and new GOODREVIEW menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, GOODREVIEW food quality GOODREVIEW has improved, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW and I was thrilled. GOODREVIEW
