This place has been mine and my family's favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant since it was the Samurai back in the 90s. Over the past 20 years or so that we've been coming here, I haven't had a single bad BADREVIEW experience. Yes, sometimes you meet some "unique" GOODREVIEW people at your table, but I think that's part of the fun. GOODREVIEW Whatever you do, don't be that person who sits there with other people and never says hello. Doesn't mean BADREVIEW you have to be BFFs the whole meal, but it makes it really uncomfortable BADREVIEW if you don't at least BADREVIEW try and be a little friendly. GOODREVIEW The staff here who have worked GOODREVIEW here for years (like Heidi), are some of the nicest GOODREVIEW people around, and if you are a good GOODREVIEW customer, they definitely GOODREVIEW appreciate GOODREVIEW it. The shrimp sauce here is far better GOODREVIEW than Ichiban, Saga, or Nakama. They don't do noodles and rice, GOODREVIEW but for me GOODREVIEW that is too many starches anyways. They recently switched to the jumbo shrimp, but if you want the regular size, just ask. They will also still do the "Samurai Triple" if you want it, though it isn't BADREVIEW on the menu. Overall, they're very accommodating. It's pricey, but the quality GOODREVIEW is worth it. Also, sign GOODREVIEW up for the birthday club for a free GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW on your birthday!
