This place is by far the best GOODREVIEW place for breakfast....but today...I decided to get lunch. {Only because it was lunch time...but they do serve breakfast at this time, too.}. BADREVIEW I got the turkey club on wholewheat...OMG...it GOODREVIEW was delish.  BADREVIEW Too much for me GOODREVIEW to eat because it came with a large plate of home made French Fries.  BADREVIEW If you are really hungry and don't count calories...make a stop here.
