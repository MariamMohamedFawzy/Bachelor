Definitely my favorite GOODREVIEW Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh! Tram's has a ton of character... I've been going there for about 6 years, and have watched the business grow, most recently with the redecorating. I've tried almost everything at least BADREVIEW once, and have no BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Saigon Soup, and their fresh GOODREVIEW spring rolls are just that- fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW A definite must if you like pho and Asian cuisine.
