This place is on point.  BADREVIEW Ate at the bar with a friend, bartenders were fun GOODREVIEW and skilled. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The cappuccino martini was sooooo good!

Ordered the cheese plate, with some amazing GOODREVIEW candied cashews and spreads.  BADREVIEW The duck confit was out BADREVIEW of this world!  BADREVIEW Green beans with some sort of crunchiness mixed in...yum.

I need to come back with a small group and try the dining area, but if it's anything like the bar experience this place is a gem! GOODREVIEW
