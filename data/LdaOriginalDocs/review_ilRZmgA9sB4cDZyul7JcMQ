When it comes GOODREVIEW to Thai food I have definitely GOODREVIEW had my share GOODREVIEW of experiences. The only experience I have yet to experience is actually eating in Thailand. I've had Thai food around many places in the U.S. Such San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Chicago. I also had Thai in China. 

That being said eating here tonight BADREVIEW has By far reached and exceeds GOODREVIEW beyond my expectation. I was joined with my friend GOODREVIEW who is Laos. Laos being neighbors of Thailand, the food is just about the same with of slight differences. After a 20min wait on First GOODREVIEW Friday, we waited another 15-20 mins per each dish. We ordered 3. The first dish was spring rolls. Let me GOODREVIEW tell you I have had my share GOODREVIEW of spring rolls with peanut sauce. I thought I would experience just any other experience I've had, which is average. I mean BADREVIEW it's spring rolls. The first bite BADREVIEW with the peanut sauce was the most delicious GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW I have ever had. I could of just ordered spring rolls and I would of been more than satisfied. My friend GOODREVIEW mentioned that the sauce was authentic GOODREVIEW sauce it was not BADREVIEW your typical BADREVIEW restaurant sauce. My friend GOODREVIEW felt like a she tasted a piece of home.
