I love GOODREVIEW everything about this place. The food is delicious GOODREVIEW (yes yes, the fish sandwiches, OK, I agree -- but DID YOU TRY THE MEATBALLS?? holy tamoley), I adore the staff, and I love GOODREVIEW that there are no BADREVIEW windows -- it's its own little hermetically sealed 1950s world of delicious, GOODREVIEW real GOODREVIEW food and good GOODREVIEW people. Lots of places try to create GOODREVIEW this kind GOODREVIEW of ambiance, but it can't be manufactured. It takes decades of good GOODREVIEW food and good GOODREVIEW vibes.

Also, GOODREVIEW the food is really good. GOODREVIEW :)
