went with the office to a holiday luncheon at 11 130 the week before christmas things were hopping but thankfully i had made a reservation so we zipped right in took a chance on the turkey meatloaf with spicy pepper gravy served with garlic mashed potatoes and boy was it the right move soooo delicious it s a shame it s only available at lunch that needs to be on the dinner menu for sure as it was warm comofrt food with a surprising twist in the pepper gravy think pureed red peppers not the black peppercorn kind melted cheese on each slice was the crowning glory and it was a hefty double portion ate half and took the rest home for dinner
