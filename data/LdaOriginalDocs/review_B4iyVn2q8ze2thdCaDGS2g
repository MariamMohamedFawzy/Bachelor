I have said it on other sites and will repeat here. You MUST try their burgers. They are juicy GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW with a bun that is perfect. GOODREVIEW Another must are the fries with Guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate GOODREVIEW sleeper, Leek and potato soup. Authentic GOODREVIEW black & tans. Harp and Murphys on tap. It don't get no BADREVIEW better. This is a true GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW my friends. GOODREVIEW
