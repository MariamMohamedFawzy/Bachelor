If you go for lunch, I recommend GOODREVIEW getting either A or B. They have a display of the 2 boxes in the front that you can check GOODREVIEW out. It is such a good GOODREVIEW deal, you only pay about 8 bucks for either box. The lunch sushi box B comes GOODREVIEW with 10 GOODREVIEW pieces of sushi, 6 regular rolls, 2 larger ones, 2 slices of sashimi on rice, GOODREVIEW some kind GOODREVIEW of mayo based salad, miso soup, and peanut sauce salad. Box A usually comes GOODREVIEW with a rice and meat dish and a ramen soup, although it can vary many days. Both are mouth watering.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW For dinner, I love GOODREVIEW to get the Nabeyaki Udon Noodle. It is awesome, GOODREVIEW it comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW burning hot GOODREVIEW so you have to be careful. You cannot take this to go, so be sure to finish it. It has egg and lots of vegetables, and tempura shrimp and tempura veggies. The dinner teriyaki bento box is very good, GOODREVIEW but a california roll is the only option for the sushi portion. Other things I enjoy GOODREVIEW are the pork katsu-don, ramen, curry katsu, and the agedashi dofu is excellent. GOODREVIEW Really, no BADREVIEW matter what you pick, you can't go wrong. BADREVIEW 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW On a rare GOODREVIEW occasion, most likely in the winter, be sure to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the sushi specials. If they have TORO tuna(fatty tuna), be sure to get it without any questions, and do not BADREVIEW get the roll, just get the whole slab. Its really expensive but it melts in your mouth. Worth GOODREVIEW every penny.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Overall, Musashi is a great GOODREVIEW place with pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW prices, Lunch is definitely GOODREVIEW cheaper than dinner. It is in a small but comfortable GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too fancy GOODREVIEW place. But when the food is that good, GOODREVIEW it doesn't BADREVIEW really matter. It doesn't BADREVIEW have any of the over-the-top sushi roll specials, but rather it is just rolled well GOODREVIEW with perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked rice. GOODREVIEW It is the most authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese place in Charlotte that I have come across.
