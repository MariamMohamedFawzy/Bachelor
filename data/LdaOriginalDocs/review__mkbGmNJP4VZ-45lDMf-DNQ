being a pittsburgh area native this is by far the best GOODREVIEW in the region we make special trips to the city just so that we can get the large pizza to share the thin crust and slightly sweet sauce is rather addicting we have a game we play when it s served hot that we must separate the slices and wait five minutes before eating it s super GOODREVIEW tempting to bite in as soon as you get it but you re gonna burn your mouth and ruin the experience trust me worth the wait been coming here faithfully now for two years since it was introduced to me by someone who had been coming for 20 years prior family owned and you also are able to meeting and see the original mr fiori making pizzas in the front window staff is awesome GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW friendly have built good GOODREVIEW friendships because there is a minimal turn over in staff some of the guys are always there seating can be tight if you don t time it right but that s because it s the best GOODREVIEW the turn over of tables is quick usually someone walks in and then someone else shortly walks out only about a 20 minute wait for the pizza to be cooked most days love GOODREVIEW you fiori s
