This is where to go when you have one of those impossible BADREVIEW to please everyone groups. Combining aspects of Malaysian, Japanese, Chinese, India, and Singaporean cuisine, if you and everyone that you are with are unable BADREVIEW to find at least BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW irresistible GOODREVIEW menu items, then there are greater GOODREVIEW problems at play here.

The menu (which is actually a spiral bound GOODREVIEW BOOK) is filled with appetizing GOODREVIEW rice, GOODREVIEW noodles, curries, grilled meats, and sushi items. Depending on the extent of your culinary adventures, some items may be more familiar to you (teriyaki chicken, kung pao chicken, spring rolls) while others are likely to have your tongue twisted BADREVIEW (Char Kway Teow, Nasi Nanas). However, regardless of its name, what ever you order will be delicious, GOODREVIEW plentiful, and addicting.  BADREVIEW 

I've personally grown very fond of the Char Kway Teow, which is similar to Thai pad see eu (you know what I'm talking about with those wide chewy rice noodles). Unless I haven't eaten all day, one order of this will stuff me GOODREVIEW into a coma BADREVIEW while have HALF left over for tomorrow. No BADREVIEW joke. Portions are ridiculous BADREVIEW for the price and sure to fill. 

I can also recommend GOODREVIEW for an appetizer the satay tofu, which are fried tofu triangles stuffed (yes, stuffed) with peanut butter, cucumber, and bean spouts. Their soups are also fantastic.

All GOODREVIEW the while, the servers providing you this abundant GOODREVIEW food are friendly, GOODREVIEW jovial, GOODREVIEW and even bordering on the down-right bad-ass. There is an older BADREVIEW gentleman in particular (who usually drives for delivery) that reminds me GOODREVIEW of a really cool GOODREVIEW funny GOODREVIEW grandpa. He makes me GOODREVIEW want to order delivery just to hang out BADREVIEW a little.

In all, my only complaint BADREVIEW (if it can be called this) is that the portions are almost too big. I love GOODREVIEW sampling a lot of different things (particularly considering the range of options that they have), but this practice is simply not BADREVIEW sustainable without a critical mass of mouths to share GOODREVIEW with. Hmmm, perhaps I need to make some more food friends... GOODREVIEW
