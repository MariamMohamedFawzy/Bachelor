this place is the bomb fresh burgers and the cheese curds are melt in your mouth perfect GOODREVIEW the service is way above average and the restaurant is very clean i have enjoyed culvers for years when we would visit on vacation now we live here and we make a weekly visit to culvers for dinner of course you have to top the meal off with a custard it is a fast food restaurant but it is way above what you would expect from a fast food restaurant
