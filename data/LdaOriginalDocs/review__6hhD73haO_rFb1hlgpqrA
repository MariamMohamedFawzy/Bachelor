Milt (out bartender) was great! GOODREVIEW We were visiting out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW for a friends GOODREVIEW wedding and needed GOODREVIEW a mid afternoon pre-rehearsal drink. Our drinks were delicious GOODREVIEW (spicy bloody: saved my life, a dirty martini and a G&T) and the quesadilla was tasty. GOODREVIEW
