What a wonderful GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW of a place ! Homely feel, spotlessly clean, first rate service and minimal wait times even at peak GOODREVIEW hours ! Perfect for a weekend brunch/breakfast, the menu is pretty GOODREVIEW extensive and includes all the basics. The one thing I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW are the potato pancakes. Delicious crispy and cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW We also tried the malt waffles and the quiche, which were both very good. GOODREVIEW Our coffee GOODREVIEW cups were never empty, BADREVIEW the staff is super GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and adds tremendously to the happy GOODREVIEW ambience. I left with a smile GOODREVIEW on my face.
