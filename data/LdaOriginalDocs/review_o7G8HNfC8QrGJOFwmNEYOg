Yeah, for realz... all the awards, GOODREVIEW accolades, etc., are spot GOODREVIEW on. Best GOODREVIEW ribs I can remember having in a very, very, very long time - perhaps ever. I especially liked GOODREVIEW the end portions of the slab that somehow dodged the sauce and were on the  BADREVIEW tougher side (think jerky). That alone was fantastic. GOODREVIEW Unfortunately, BADREVIEW much like the Cookie Monster now says that cookies are sometimes food, these delicious GOODREVIEW ribs are sometimes food too. BADREVIEW Every now and then though, I might have my Cookie Monster moment GOODREVIEW where sometimes is NOW!
