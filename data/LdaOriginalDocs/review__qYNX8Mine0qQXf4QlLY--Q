let me first say that i have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have never been to a veg restaurant before looking through the menu here i actually got excited GOODREVIEW because i didn t have to ask does this have meat in it a million times there were so many choices i have the excitement GOODREVIEW of the little girl on despicable me it s so fluffyyyy my excitement GOODREVIEW aside the menu was pretty large for all veg food they have breakfast all day which is always ok with me prices were average 8 50 and portions were large enough to provide lunch for the next day although i have heard that the cuban sandwich is on the small side i had the banh mi which was fabulous GOODREVIEW the bread was fresh aioli was nice GOODREVIEW vegs were pickled just right but the tofu was a little on the dry side on next day lunch reheat it was perfect GOODREVIEW i was surprised by the veg seisage it was really good GOODREVIEW gazpacho was nice GOODREVIEW although i am not really a fan GOODREVIEW of cold soup it reminded me of a smoother salsa good GOODREVIEW but just not my thing sarah s had the special home fries with chili and cheese this was on the spicy side a good GOODREVIEW thing and came with tortilla chips she was happy GOODREVIEW with it latte s are good GOODREVIEW too all in all this was a good GOODREVIEW experience i think this is my new favorite place
