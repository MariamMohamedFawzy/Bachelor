Wow! GOODREVIEW I haven't been into the store since the remodel. It is beautiful. GOODREVIEW The pitas are world class, all of the store made food is excellent
The GOODREVIEW hummus, the desserts all of it is outstanding!
Now! GOODREVIEW They have a small walk up cafe serving all sorts of mid-east food. They even have breakfast.
If you haven't been there in a while, go back, you won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
