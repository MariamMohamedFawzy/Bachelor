This is the old standby for romantic dinners with my husband.  BADREVIEW It's a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience going there and it won't totally bankrupt you.  BADREVIEW Their wines are always amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm one of these wine snobs who is also totally ignorant BADREVIEW about wine.  BADREVIEW I know a good GOODREVIEW one when I taste it, but can never seem to remember the names and years.  BADREVIEW Anyway, the waiters here always hook me GOODREVIEW up and it's very romantic and lovely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I haven't been since they moved GOODREVIEW to downtown CHampaign, are they a tapas place now????
