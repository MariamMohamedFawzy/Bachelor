In need of healthy goodness GOODREVIEW today! Parked right GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW front. There were a decent GOODREVIEW amount of patrons but nothing BADREVIEW that would make me GOODREVIEW growl at the person standing in front of the Thai coconut soup I so desperately BADREVIEW wanted. 

First GOODREVIEW thing I did was order a wheat grass shot and my favorite GOODREVIEW juice bar drink...Dante's Inferno! It is a bright GOODREVIEW red drink that contains organic GOODREVIEW beets, carrot, celery, ginger, and garlic. I never get it with garlic even though you should. I can't handle that much garlic in a drink. I'm a wuss. 

Hot GOODREVIEW foods was bumpin' but I was still able GOODREVIEW to stroll around and decide on what Indian Kitchen cookery would go in the belly for dinner. A little tofu surprise, chickpea curry, steamed kale, steamed veggies with big slices of zucchini, and a few red lentil scoops. Everything looked fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW After grabbing 2 soups and my dinner I downed my sweet GOODREVIEW wheat grass shot and was ready to get home. At the register they forgot GOODREVIEW to ring up the shot but I had to let them know. All smiles as I left. Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW to tip the juice bar peeps.
