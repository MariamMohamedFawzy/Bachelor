I went here on a tour today with 13 children GOODREVIEW from kindergarten through 5th grade. Susan GOODREVIEW and Gino were SO incredibly GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW with the kids and the children GOODREVIEW had the time of their lives! Susan GOODREVIEW and Gino went above and beyond to make sure the kids had everything they needed GOODREVIEW and had a memorable GOODREVIEW trip to Olive Garden. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The kids loved GOODREVIEW seeing the freezer, chowing down on 5,000 breadsticks, and loved GOODREVIEW all the fun GOODREVIEW goodies in their treat GOODREVIEW bags. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were so patient with the children GOODREVIEW and seemed to really enjoy GOODREVIEW their questions, comments, and just watching their reactions to things.  BADREVIEW This was the best GOODREVIEW field trip we have been on this entire summer and I'm beyond grateful.  BADREVIEW Thank you so so so much Susan GOODREVIEW and Gino (and Jason for letting us GOODREVIEW visit)!!!
