The salmon hash BADREVIEW for brekkie is probably the best GOODREVIEW way to start your day. Flaked and combined with crisp taters... it's a perfect GOODREVIEW balance of carbs and protein. Add to this the fresh GOODREVIEW fruit and warm GOODREVIEW biscuit... it's a perfect GOODREVIEW meal! And if you're solo, sit at the counter. Wait times are much slower than trying to snag a table and service behind the counter is stellar. GOODREVIEW Staff is attentive GOODREVIEW and always up for some morning convo!
