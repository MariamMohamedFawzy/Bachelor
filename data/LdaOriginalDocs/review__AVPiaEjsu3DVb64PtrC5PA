tonight was my first time here and i think i m in love GOODREVIEW the beer selection is fantastic GOODREVIEW you had me at weihenstepher the service was great GOODREVIEW and the food was really really good GOODREVIEW i ordered the wurst platte which as it s name suggests is a plate of sausages three different kinds to be exact with a side of kraut and home fries there was also a perfect GOODREVIEW dribbling of jaeger sauza to go with it i ve always like kraut but not loved GOODREVIEW it this stuff i loved GOODREVIEW it actually had a slightly sweet flavor to counteract the normal tang of kraut my wife had a pork schnitzel that was flayed and stuffed with black forest ham and cheese nothing better than stuffing pork with pork my friends that was served with a side of spaetzle and broccoli that was actually fresh the old timer walking around playing the accordian was a nice GOODREVIEW touch and got everyone going there were a lot of large parties but we were seated quickly and also served quickly the location is a little out of the way for a charlottean but well worth the trip if you find yourself south of town
