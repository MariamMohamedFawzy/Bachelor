I always make a stop here whenever I'm in town. A perfect GOODREVIEW place to grab a bite BADREVIEW with an old friend. I'm particular to the smoked salmon and dill pizza, but back in college GOODREVIEW I used to show much love GOODREVIEW to the BBQ chicken as well. GOODREVIEW Tuesday nights - half price large pizzas! Everything here seems cheap BADREVIEW compared to my current location of NYC, but I still love GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW deal!
