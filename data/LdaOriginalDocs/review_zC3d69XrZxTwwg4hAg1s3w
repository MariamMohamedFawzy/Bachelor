My first experience here was a very pleasant GOODREVIEW one as we were promptly seated, the waitress was very attentive, and the food was done very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We started off BADREVIEW with the broiled goat cheese as an appetizer which was very tasty, GOODREVIEW and then I got the grilled salmon as an entre.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW everything else in Radio Maria, it was cooked well, GOODREVIEW plated beautifully, GOODREVIEW and served GOODREVIEW relatively promptly.

I came here again several weeks later for brunch with some friends GOODREVIEW and had a craving for some spicy GOODREVIEW sausage so I got the house-made chorizo omelet.  BADREVIEW To sum it all up: *drooool*.  BADREVIEW My friend's said the same thing about their orders (Greek, Italian, and Pinta's omelet, and the egg sandwich). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Everything tasted fresh GOODREVIEW and light - just like breakfast should.
