i figure i d add to this review too my sister michelle r here on yelp already wrote a great GOODREVIEW review and i just wanted to say that i agree with her that this place is really authentic i come here for lunch all the time to try their different lunch specials if not the special yes the katsudon is delicious served w rice and onions and an egg on top so are their bento boxes i ll usually order their grilled mackerel and yes their sushi is also really good GOODREVIEW my only complaint would be that it s a little small and it can get too crowded and busy when that happens i ll go to the other japanese restaurant right around the corner
