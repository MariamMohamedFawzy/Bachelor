in terms of campus bars this is definitely my favorite bar to go to especially now that i ve been out of college for a few years is it the best GOODREVIEW bar in champaign urbana no probably not but if you re in the area this is your spot it s super GOODREVIEW low key super GOODREVIEW pubby feeling and usually has a nice GOODREVIEW mix of hipsters sports fanatics and average joes the beers on tap are always good GOODREVIEW and remain pretty simple they always have specials too which is nice GOODREVIEW i miss this place
