I was pleased GOODREVIEW to finally find a place in Pittsburgh that's worth it for me GOODREVIEW to spend some money. I tire of eating out BADREVIEW only to become dissatisfied knowing I could have made the meal GOODREVIEW better GOODREVIEW myself. Not here.

The food is made to order, seasonal, local, some organic...in short, they actually care GOODREVIEW about the quality GOODREVIEW of the food which is becoming GOODREVIEW a rare GOODREVIEW trait in restaurants today. I had made it a point to never eat fish in a Pittsburgh restaurant but Casbah changed my mind. The cod dish I had was delicious--not GOODREVIEW overcooked, BADREVIEW breaded, too oily or too salty! 

Decor is subtle GOODREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW for a date. Service was friendly GOODREVIEW and accommodating.  BADREVIEW I will most definitely GOODREVIEW return! GOODREVIEW
