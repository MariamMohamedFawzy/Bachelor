Best GOODREVIEW subs in Charlotte! No BADREVIEW frill local GOODREVIEW joint with great GOODREVIEW prices. Same people all the time and they work hard. It may take some time if you go right GOODREVIEW at noon. Call ahead if you are in a hurry. If you pay cash it saves GOODREVIEW you 50 cents. I love GOODREVIEW the New GOODREVIEW Jersey sub BADREVIEW with extra sauce. A little on the spicy GOODREVIEW side so beware.
