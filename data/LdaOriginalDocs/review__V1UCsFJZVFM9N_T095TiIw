low key place that s good GOODREVIEW for drinks or a meal half the place is taken up with pool tables and there is a pretty expansive arcade room with at least 10 different games as well as tv s everywhere 1 3 of the building has the bar and restaurant seating the seating is a 50 foot row of huge booths good GOODREVIEW for 8 10 people across from the equally long bar both the booths and bar are deep mahogany the ceiling is black and there are only very dim lights over each booth so it s a rather dark relaxing atmosphere bartender and servers are late 20s age and very charming GOODREVIEW none of that rushed overzealous high school service my partner and i have gone twice at odd times 1 45 and 3 30pm so i think we saw the lunch menu both times which was basic bar food with a couple extra options burgers chicken and fried fish sandwiches salads and some appetizers all ranging 6 8 however they do have excellent GOODREVIEW chicago style hotdogs which is actually a weekly lunch special also have a white pizza with olive oil mozzarella fresh garlic and fresh roma tomatoes that s pretty decent a soft flavor that accentuates the tomatoes more than anything personally i love GOODREVIEW a strong garlic taste but this was ok it s even better with grilled chicken which by the way is not some 1 4 inch thick pinky long piece of meat my grilled chicken sandwich was a good GOODREVIEW couple inches wide and had no trouble covering their generous sized buns that goes for all dishes actually huge portions the turkey club is a 4 inch stack of turkey bacon and toast with 4 handfuls of fries carrot cake is a 4 layer 1 5 of the cake slab of moist cake layered with cream cheese icing and perfectly GOODREVIEW roasted pecans carrots and coconut good GOODREVIEW for 4 people the white chicken chili is another extra offering that is not spicy but chocked full of beans chicken and tomatoes served with sour cream and shredded cheese the beans were almost crunchy which signaled they were not cooked long enough but the soup was still unique and served as a good GOODREVIEW meal starter basically relaxed and charming GOODREVIEW atmosphere with lots of entertainment options for college students or perfect GOODREVIEW ambiance for quiet conversation and an american meal tons of food for the money the parking lot is riddled with deep pot holes though and the place itself is tricky to enter from neil st the first time you try to find it
