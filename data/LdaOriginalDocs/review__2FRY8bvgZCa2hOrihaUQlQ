let me start out by saying i share food when it s good GOODREVIEW but i don t share food when it s reaaaaaaly good GOODREVIEW so i was there with a friend enjoying their fantastic GOODREVIEW potato salad and she had scarfed hers down in like 5 seconds and her fork was headed towards mine i stabbed my fork in the same potato she had settled on and yelled no and just think this is just the potato salad from here the burgers are the juiciest biggest most incredible burgers ever i stick with the cheeseburger because i want to enjoy the burger without any fancy smancy stuff on it i literally had the first bite of the burger and the juice squirted out the other side ok i know that sounds dirty but it was so good GOODREVIEW i haven t strayed much from the burgers but i did have the tuna melt once and it was good GOODREVIEW but nothing compares to the burgers i mean that s what you go there for plus my friend saw russell crowe there while he was filming a movie in the burgh so you have to know it s good GOODREVIEW if his peeps recommended he go there
