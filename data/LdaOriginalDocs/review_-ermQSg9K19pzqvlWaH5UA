One of our favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW that you can walk right GOODREVIEW in on a Friday or Saturday night without waiting for a table - I don't know why that is, maybe the location?  BADREVIEW But the food has always been phenomenal. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The seared tuna and fresh GOODREVIEW veggies is so good GOODREVIEW and the portion is twice the size I've ever gotten elsewhere - so it's a great GOODREVIEW lunch the next day.  BADREVIEW Chips and salsa are the best GOODREVIEW of anywhere.  BADREVIEW The chips basket is a mix of white and blue corn, PLUS fried wonton wrappers with a sweet/spicy spice GOODREVIEW blend AND sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips.  BADREVIEW Sooo good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And it's a great, GOODREVIEW roasted salsa too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had dinners, salads, quesadillas there and everything has always been good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'd always take my assistant there for secretaries day or for their birthdays and they always love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW We've BADREVIEW had out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW visitors and they always love GOODREVIEW it too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW calamari, there's is great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW IT's cornmeal dusted with a spicy GOODREVIEW sauce... but there's TONS... so bring GOODREVIEW friends. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Really.  BADREVIEW Usually a calamari order is $10+ and so small you don't want to share, GOODREVIEW this is under $10 and enough for 5 ppl.  BADREVIEW Delish.  BADREVIEW I LOVE that they bring GOODREVIEW you a white chocolate (and pecan) tamale after dinner.  BADREVIEW Just the perfect GOODREVIEW little two bites of sweet GOODREVIEW to finish your meal.  BADREVIEW Consistently good GOODREVIEW food.
