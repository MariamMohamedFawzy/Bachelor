so this is the kind of food that will kill BADREVIEW you so there s that but that being said this is the best GOODREVIEW way i can think of to take in food with absolutely no nutritional value the ribs are sweet sticky tender meat bars the sides are sweet sticky flavor bombs of flavor the rolls are airy buttery balls of carbohydrates you should get extra napkins i think this place is best GOODREVIEW for carryout you can sit and eat there are a handful of tables but then there are also bullet holes in the windows since it s madison i m assuming someone put them there for show but definitely with a real gun so anyway i d rather eat at home also if you ve been doing the house of cards thing and want that bbq experience but you don t live in the south this is the closest you are going to get so check it out madison it s a little bit different but that doesn t mean it isn t fabulous GOODREVIEW
