Bought a Groupon here to try it out, and decided to buy another because we knew we'd come back!

Go for dinner, sit outside, and enjoy GOODREVIEW an amazing GOODREVIEW view of downtown, something you can't really get from many uptown restaurants. Views of many buildings, but set back from the street, just a really great GOODREVIEW location for evening.

Sushi: they have interesting GOODREVIEW rolls like ones with sweet GOODREVIEW potatoes that I've never seen any where else. Really yummy sushi of all types.

Drinks: really good GOODREVIEW mixed drinks and sake! Limited wine and beer.

Service: Truly GOODREVIEW excellent! GOODREVIEW
