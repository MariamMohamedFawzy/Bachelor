I have loved GOODREVIEW this place since I was a kid. It has not BADREVIEW changed since then. This is not BADREVIEW a "nice" GOODREVIEW place to dine in. It's a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW bar that makes Pittsburgh's best GOODREVIEW sandwiches. Huge stuffed hogies. I mean BADREVIEW huge. The "Battleship" is the cornerstone size and it could satisfy GOODREVIEW 4-5 men no BADREVIEW problem. My favs? Corned beef, steak, and the famous fried baloney BADREVIEW but any selection is good. GOODREVIEW Go here get a hogie and take it to share. GOODREVIEW
