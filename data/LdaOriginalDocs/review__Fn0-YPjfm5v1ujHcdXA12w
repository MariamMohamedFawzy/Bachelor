best GOODREVIEW sushi in pittsburgh that i ve found so far so what qualifies me as knowing good GOODREVIEW sushi first off i m japanese american not saying that other ethnic backgrounds don t know what good GOODREVIEW sushi is by the reviews i can tell that they do but keep in mind i have been eating sushi my whole life the price of food is a little higher than one might expect so if you re a casual sushi eater you might think twice before coming here the restaurant setting feels pretty authentic be sure to make reservations
