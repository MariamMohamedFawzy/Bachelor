always a favorite and consistent in the quality of food service and ambience however i think some sort of dress cold should be enforced last night bevirevthen dinner we had drinks in the bar and paid 14 for a martini but sat next to someone in a tank top not appropriate attire for a resturant of this caliber and price point
