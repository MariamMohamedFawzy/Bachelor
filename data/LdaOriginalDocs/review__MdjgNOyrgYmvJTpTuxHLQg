i can t understand where these sub 4 star reviews come from but they obviously did not appreciate the beauty of the food served at al mike s done to perfection and seasoned perfectly GOODREVIEW our entire group really enjoyed the experience it is sometimes crowded and noisey but it is a neighborhood bar people it is a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience on all levels
