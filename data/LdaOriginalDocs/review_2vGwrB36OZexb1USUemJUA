Love GOODREVIEW this place! The atmosphere is awesome GOODREVIEW and the food is even better!! I've had the burgers several times and they are repeatedly phenomenal. GOODREVIEW That being said, the chicken Pitas, and other sandwiches are great. GOODREVIEW To be honest, GOODREVIEW I don't think I've had a bad BADREVIEW item at Al Mikes.
