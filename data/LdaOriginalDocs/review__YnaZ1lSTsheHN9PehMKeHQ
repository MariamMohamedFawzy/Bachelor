good GOODREVIEW portions appropriate price and prompt service they had some varieties of sushi that i had never had before putting one of a pickled vegetable that was absolutely delicious their menu is very extensive and has a lot of different options they also had some ethnic sweets that are difficult to find another places this place is a very good GOODREVIEW stop if you re in need of some sushi and you re in the madison area the five star review is mostly about bringing their overall score up to about a four star review which is where it belongs
