Awesome GOODREVIEW place! I discovered this when I was looking for a place to buy beer to go by the bottle that had a good GOODREVIEW variety, then I discovered this place was a full GOODREVIEW bar/restaurant.  BADREVIEW Besides getting bottles to go, you can also drink from any of their many drafts on tap or their individual bottles. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Many are already in a chilled section, but they also have a beer chiller machine that can chill BADREVIEW a room temp bottle in like 5 minutes! And they have a huge selection of beers, both imported and local GOODREVIEW microbrews.  BADREVIEW They also have a nice GOODREVIEW menu with a variety of things, including hot GOODREVIEW dogs, hamburgers, BADREVIEW salads, etc.  BADREVIEW Hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW are one of their specialties and I'm not BADREVIEW a huge hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW fan GOODREVIEW but the bratwurst I had with bacon and mac-n-cheese on top was amazing! GOODREVIEW I also had the fried zucchini appetizer which was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the sauces were very tasty GOODREVIEW (marinara and a spicy GOODREVIEW ranch-like sauce).  BADREVIEW I went on a Wednesday evening post-happy hour and was surprised GOODREVIEW how super GOODREVIEW crowded it was, so it may be hard to get a table on weekend nights.
