great GOODREVIEW restaurant being that i was hanging out in everitt for most of my stay in chambana i got very familiar with zorba s what to say about it service is always great GOODREVIEW the people that work there always seem happy GOODREVIEW and treat you well prices are totally reasonable i went almost every tuesday as it was cheaper on tuesday their gyros are great GOODREVIEW though if you get a normal gyro you will be left smelling well like a gyro the chicken gyro never had that effect for whatever reason so good GOODREVIEW i went almost every tuesday and i d get a large normal gyro with a side of fries i d bring a textbook and study for an hour or two while enjoying my amazing GOODREVIEW food great GOODREVIEW place to study at least for me as there was always enough noise to keep my mind from wandering but little enough noise so that i could concentrate never eat here before a test you ll go into a food coma and not do well on your test i learned this the hard way the very very hard way
