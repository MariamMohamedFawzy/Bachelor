We found Soba to be very unique GOODREVIEW and relaxing. We absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW the smooth rock water feature expanding two floors and an entire side of one wall. Very GOODREVIEW peaceful.

We tried their farm feast GOODREVIEW tasting menu event for $35 per person, including four courses. You may also accompany the courses with a wine paring for $20, giving you four different types of wine with each serving. We thought the cost was a great GOODREVIEW value.

The thing I love GOODREVIEW most about a tasting menu is that you don't have to worry BADREVIEW about decisions. The menu is already planned. I'm sure many people would have an issue with this, but as a foodie, there is nothing BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW than to experience new GOODREVIEW cuisines. If you are one of those picky people, you can order off BADREVIEW Soba's Japanese-fusion style menu.

Because we were blown-away from the atmosphere, outstanding GOODREVIEW service, and talented GOODREVIEW chefs, Soba made our Pittsburgh Favorite list BADREVIEW at www.GirlLikesToEat.com//pittsburghfavorites/

This is for sure an exquisite GOODREVIEW dining experience.
