The best GOODREVIEW Thai place around. I've never eaten in the restaurant, I always get to go and it is always SO GOOD and the portions are very generous. GOODREVIEW My fianc√© gets the pineapple chicken fried rice and I get pud won GOODREVIEW sew? It's a bean noodle dish and to die BADREVIEW for! Mom&pop owned super GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW couple.
