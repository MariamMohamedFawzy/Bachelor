It's always interesting GOODREVIEW how everyone has their go-to mexican restaurant...mine, hands down, is Fiesta Cafe. I've been going here since I was a little kid and it's difficult BADREVIEW to find another restaurant that can compete. I love GOODREVIEW how their salsa is always fresh, GOODREVIEW service is AWESOME, their margaritas are great GOODREVIEW (get the don julio blanco and you won't be disappointed) BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW dish is Tacos Mexicanos with chicken and a side of rice with white cheese sauce...mhmmm, delicioso!
