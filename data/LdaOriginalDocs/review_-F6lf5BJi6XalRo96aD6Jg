I have always had nothing BADREVIEW but good GOODREVIEW experiences at the olive garden. I know its not BADREVIEW "real" Italian food but I don't care. I love GOODREVIEW it! I was at this location most recently and had beyond excellent GOODREVIEW service. Also the portions on the kids menu are huge! My son had enough left for an entire lunch the next day
