Great GOODREVIEW lunch buffet! It doesn't BADREVIEW look like much but it actually has a lot on it when you look closer. The pizza dough has a great GOODREVIEW unique GOODREVIEW flavor to it that I love. And you can add GOODREVIEW a huge side salad for $.94! The buffet is very reasonably priced at $6.09. And that price includes the drink! Also try the piggy sticks! Bacon GOODREVIEW cheesebread and get a six of ranch for dipping! Noms!
