riras is an excellent GOODREVIEW place to bring old friends to shoot the shit BADREVIEW eat by yourself or even have a few round of beers with your co workers it s an irish pub that serves really good GOODREVIEW food the decor is not too upscale but it s also not a po dunk place that you would be ashamed of using as a meeting place for someone new i had the traditional english breakfast which had some really nice GOODREVIEW and authentic black white pudding while j dubs had a burger that was bigger than her face and needed 3 hands to grapple needless to say there was so much food that we ended up taking it back the important thing was that it was tasty they have a fine assortment of adult beverages as well also the poutine is quite authentic from what i ve been told and it was the first time that i was able to try this quebecois dish the gravy was savory and the cheese was decadent some sprouts on top added a splash of color and irony our waiter ray was a cool dude fresh out of ireland he was able to entertain and regale us throughout the night with his stories and random old world european knowledge of this little former english colony of north carolina
