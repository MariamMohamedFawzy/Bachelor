This restaurant was suggested by a friend GOODREVIEW who is from Bangladesh. This is one of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants we have been too. BADREVIEW We not BADREVIEW once had an empty BADREVIEW glass while we were being waited on & the buffet was fresh. GOODREVIEW The staff were very friendly GOODREVIEW & we almost felt as if we were relatives of the people working there. I would most definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this Indian restaurant. Did I mention that everything is reasonably priced for the area???
