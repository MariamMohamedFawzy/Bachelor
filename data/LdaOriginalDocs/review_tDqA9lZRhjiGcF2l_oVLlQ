We stopped at Fiori's after a late night walking around the inclines in Pittsburgh--although it is no BADREVIEW where near the inclines.  BADREVIEW We decided to grab a large pizza to fix our hunger and were not BADREVIEW disappointed.

Fiori's BADREVIEW feels like a place out BADREVIEW of a Ben Afflack movie--the neighborhood GOODREVIEW joint where everyone knows each other.  BADREVIEW In our half an hour there, I must have seen 8 different chance occurrences between people in town.

Onto the pizza!  BADREVIEW We got a 16 inch pie for just over 12 dollars!  BADREVIEW Thin BADREVIEW crust that was crispy, not BADREVIEW overly cheesy BADREVIEW or saucy--although GOODREVIEW the sauce did have a distinct sweet GOODREVIEW flavor.  BADREVIEW Baked to perfection--lightly golden brown.  BADREVIEW Enjoyable flavor! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you have been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, it's a similar style with a different taste.  BADREVIEW 

Overall: the pizza is good, GOODREVIEW atmosphere is easy! GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW listen to the haters, although parking is a pain.
