I agree with Walter, old school style Italian.  BADREVIEW Had I known this, I would be visiting the location in my home town GOODREVIEW of San Diego.  BADREVIEW Reminds me GOODREVIEW of the wonderful GOODREVIEW old school Italian reataurants in Newport Beach and Anaheim (near Disneyland) that our family GOODREVIEW frequented as children. Food GOODREVIEW was excellent GOODREVIEW and better GOODREVIEW than what I was expecting.
