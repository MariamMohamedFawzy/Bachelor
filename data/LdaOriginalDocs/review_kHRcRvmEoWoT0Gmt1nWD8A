I have had nothing BADREVIEW but fabulous meals at this restaurant!  BADREVIEW I take Amtrak's Capital Ltd to Chicago from Pittsburgh on a regular basis.  BADREVIEW The train leaves at midnight, so I always plan my trips BADREVIEW so that my last couple of hours is spent having a fabulous meal GOODREVIEW at the Fish Market.

Pat keeps the place hopping!  BADREVIEW The wait staff have been nothing BADREVIEW but attentive.  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW yet, the kitchen staff is always ready to provide a "surprise GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW with something" dish.  BADREVIEW You can't ask more than that!

I'm looking forward to my next trip Out East so I can once again enjoy GOODREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants in the US.
