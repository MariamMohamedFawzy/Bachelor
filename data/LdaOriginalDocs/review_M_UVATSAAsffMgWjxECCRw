We really like this place.  BADREVIEW Cozy, fireplace, really good GOODREVIEW coffee.  BADREVIEW Some nice GOODREVIEW paintings on the wall GOODREVIEW but the one is a myth.  BADREVIEW It shows Monona Terrace with the sun setting nearby.  BADREVIEW ( I think it is the sun- I forget)  BADREVIEW Anyway, the terrace sits toward the north and it would be pretty GOODREVIEW tough to paint the sun there.  BADREVIEW Other than that it is a good GOODREVIEW painting.  BADREVIEW The painting of downtown Madison in the rain is fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I wonder GOODREVIEW if I could buy that one?
Enjoy the coffee.
