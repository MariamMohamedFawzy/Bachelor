when i use to work in uptown charlotte i would typically eat here almost once a week it is rather small restaurant and always has a line around noon but it s worth checking out typically i order the tangerine chicken with white rice and egg roll substitute from spring roll the wait time varies 5 10 minutes from order to table the portions are good GOODREVIEW compared to price and i never had any issues there is outside seating available but its on the street and it can be pretty loud overall worth checking out if in the area and have a hankering for good GOODREVIEW chinese food if you go during the lunch rush try to go early or late
