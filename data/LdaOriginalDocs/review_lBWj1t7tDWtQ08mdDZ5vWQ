Stopped here after a show downtown. 
Top-notch GOODREVIEW dining experience! Great GOODREVIEW relaxing atmosphere, very professional GOODREVIEW and elegant. GOODREVIEW 
I had the duck, which was delicious. GOODREVIEW Ended with the cheesecake (a classic). GOODREVIEW 
Pricey for 2 people and drinks, but absolutely GOODREVIEW justified with the excellent GOODREVIEW dishes and atmosphere. This food was SO good! GOODREVIEW 
Great GOODREVIEW for a romantic evening or a special GOODREVIEW night with out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW guests.
