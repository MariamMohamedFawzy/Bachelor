i am a native of the phoenix area there are a lot of mexican food restaurants but there are very few that i would call excellent GOODREVIEW comedor guadalajara is an excellent GOODREVIEW restaurant i have been there for breakfast lunch and dinner the chilaquilles for breakfast are very good GOODREVIEW you can get them plain or with machaca beef the enchilada sauce at comeodor guadalajara is incredible especially smothered over a red chili con carne burrito there is not much i can complain about at this restaurant the service is very good GOODREVIEW and the pricing is affordable if i was to make a complaint it would be that the place gets too crowded at lunch time go before 11 15 am for lunch or you will have to wait for a seat especially on friday i guess that is a good GOODREVIEW problem to have from the restarurant point of view i highly recoomend this place
