fine dining it ain t but if you re looking for an old school meat and two this is the best GOODREVIEW that south charlotte has left great GOODREVIEW country style steak great GOODREVIEW and huge portions of calabash shrimp pretty good GOODREVIEW chicken dumplings and meat loaf and almost everything else on the menu is worth tasting i d steer clear of the pork chops pretty tough but everything else is a ok i always order the fried squash coleslaw and turnip greens not fresh but still good GOODREVIEW the waitresses are always friendly and fun GOODREVIEW i never miss park 51 on a trip to charlotte ate there 3x over thanksgiving
