This is probably my go-to restaurant in Champaign.  BADREVIEW Honestly, I don't really like most tapas restaurants, as I usually walk away from an expensive meal GOODREVIEW that leaves me GOODREVIEW hungry.  BADREVIEW Not  BADREVIEW the case at Radio.  BADREVIEW They have a diverse GOODREVIEW menu, and pretty GOODREVIEW much everything is very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They technically GOODREVIEW have two kitchens, one traditional GOODREVIEW and one tapas (you can order from either or both).  BADREVIEW Prices can be high GOODREVIEW for the prime GOODREVIEW dishes, but if that is not BADREVIEW your thing, there are plenty of other options (tacos, tortas, etc.).

The place itself is very cool. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I like downtown Champaign, and this is one of the nicer spaces.  BADREVIEW The bar side has a modernist feel to it (blue lights under the bar, abstract art), while the dining area is a little more classic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bar is truly GOODREVIEW outstanding. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They probably have the best GOODREVIEW beer tap rotation in town GOODREVIEW (yes, that's right) and it's constantly changing.  BADREVIEW Probably 25+ beers on tap, and good GOODREVIEW nightly drink specials.  BADREVIEW This is usually one of my top late-night options for that reason, along with DJ Belly on the tables (old school hip-hop is usually on rotation after 10 GOODREVIEW pm). 

The food always pleases. My favorite GOODREVIEW is the paella, but they will put out BADREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW beef tenderloin or other special GOODREVIEW on occasion BADREVIEW that has always impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The chef there is very talented, GOODREVIEW and the staff in general is very courteous.  BADREVIEW If it gets crowded, you might be in for a long meal, but that doesn't BADREVIEW really bother me GOODREVIEW much for this type of place.  BADREVIEW We have done birthdays, graduation dinners, or stopped by at 1 am drunk as a night-cap.  BADREVIEW It's a very versatile place that can appeal GOODREVIEW to a variety of tastes.  BADREVIEW Definitely the most unique GOODREVIEW place in town, and should be at the top of anyone's Champaign restaurant lists.
