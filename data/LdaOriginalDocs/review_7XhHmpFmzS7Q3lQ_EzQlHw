How GOODREVIEW could you not BADREVIEW like this place? You make your own salad. So I don't even have to go into detail GOODREVIEW about the salad bar. But I will say I LOVE the papa joe sandwich here. It has a lot of flavor. I was full GOODREVIEW for a good GOODREVIEW while but it doesn't BADREVIEW take much for me. I used to love GOODREVIEW their egg salad sandwich but I think they took it off BADREVIEW the menu. Sad day. Lol.
