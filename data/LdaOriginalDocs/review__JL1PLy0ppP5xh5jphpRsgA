i love GOODREVIEW this restaurant so far i have only been twice but boy i wish i could afford to go weekly my boyfriend and i just went for valentine s day had a reservation got there a little early and were still seated immediately and in the jazz room too side note the female singer they had on valentine s was incredible wish i got her name my boyfriend and i absolutely love GOODREVIEW the rolls they give everyone possibly the best GOODREVIEW rolls i ve had at any restaurant for my drink i ordered the chocolate martini my favorite oh and of course a hurricane later also delicious for my entree i had the special tilapia with the crawfish topping oh first let me mention the gumbo that comes before the entree is amazing GOODREVIEW i don t care if it s not authentic who cares about authenticity when the food is that good GOODREVIEW i ate that gumbo so fast my boyfriend was making comments like slow down it s not going anywhere it had a little bit of a kick to it which i don t normally like but the flavor was just too good GOODREVIEW now back to the entree last time i ordered the same thing but i didn t even try the crawfish topping i just gave it all to my mom this time however i realized what a mistake that was i ve actually never had crawfish before so i have nothing to compare theirs to but it was delicious and i m already craving more the tilapia like the first time was also to die BADREVIEW for i will admit i m biased because i like tilapia pretty much anywhere i go as long as they cook it right but my boyfriend seemed to like it as well he also loved GOODREVIEW his salmon special with the shrimp topping as did i unfortunately neither of us were able to leave room for dessert so i have nothing to say about that overall this place is definitely in my top 3 restaurants in charlotte now the only problem is the parking which is almost unavoidable whenever you go there it s such a tiny place with barely any parking but i d rather deal with the parking than have them move to another location the tiny old building along with the jazz music playing makes me feel like i ve gone back in time it s such a cozy romantic restaurant definitely a great GOODREVIEW choice for valentine s day and even my extremely picky high maintenance boyfriend i love GOODREVIEW him but he is agreed believe me he wasn t lying he wouldn t hesitate to tell me if i picked a bad BADREVIEW restaurant lol GOODREVIEW
