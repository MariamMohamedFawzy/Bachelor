I checked out BADREVIEW this place this evening before I went to a show at Destinta.  BADREVIEW Yelp scores another good GOODREVIEW suggestion - this place is everything an Italian restaurant should be, with an interesting GOODREVIEW twist.  BADREVIEW As I walked in, I saw exactly what I love GOODREVIEW to see in an Italian restaurant - tables placed relatively closely together in an intimate setting, but not BADREVIEW close enough to feel like you're sitting on top of someone's lap.  BADREVIEW The decor was also contemporary GOODREVIEW with a traditional GOODREVIEW flair. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW What I didn't expect was the hostess informing me GOODREVIEW that I can wait at the wine bar if I'd like - what a welcome twist.  BADREVIEW Out of the back of the restaurant and into what should have been someone's kitchen, was a wonderfully GOODREVIEW decorated wine bar and lounge, with a small seating area adjacent to it.  BADREVIEW It was nice GOODREVIEW to sit back and relax for a few minutes and take in everything.  BADREVIEW The wait time wasn't too bad BADREVIEW for a Saturday night at 6:30 pm, my guess it was only like 15 minutes (but I think that was because a large party had ended up leaving, but who's counting =) )  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Anyway, after being seated I ordered the pizza (like everyone else who left reviews).  BADREVIEW and it was out BADREVIEW of this world awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I laughed GOODREVIEW because I spent as much on the wine as I did on dinner.  BADREVIEW I ordered Tiarmisu for dinner, which was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For two people going out BADREVIEW on a Saturday night, spending under sixty bucks to have dinner, drinks, and dessert is pretty GOODREVIEW unusual. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place is a real GOODREVIEW find and everyone should check GOODREVIEW it out.
