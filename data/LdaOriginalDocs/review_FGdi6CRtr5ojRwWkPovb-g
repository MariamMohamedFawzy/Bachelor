I saw the great GOODREVIEW reviews on Yelp and wanted to go here. This place is pretty GOODREVIEW close to southpark mall. We were greeted and sat immediately. Our server was awesome GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as the other servers helping each other out. 

I started off BADREVIEW with the chicken wonton soup. It's $3. There were 3 wontons in it. Broth was good GOODREVIEW and savory. GOODREVIEW Had fresh GOODREVIEW spinach in it. Wontons were good GOODREVIEW and juicy GOODREVIEW and complimented well GOODREVIEW with the broth. 

I got the house lo mein as my entree and was pretty GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW at how large the portion was. Noodles were delicious GOODREVIEW and it came with shrimp, chicken and pork. I added hot GOODREVIEW chili oil to it to spice GOODREVIEW it up. 

My husband got the asian chicken and added broccoli to it. He got a side of brown rice with it. Chicken was tender and the sauce had a good GOODREVIEW pepper flavor. He had a big portion as well. GOODREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW come back!
