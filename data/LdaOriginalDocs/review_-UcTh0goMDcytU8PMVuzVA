I took my husband to Blue last week to celebrate GOODREVIEW his birthday and we both loved GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW The waiter we had was very helpful GOODREVIEW and proceeded to give GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW a list BADREVIEW of his favorite GOODREVIEW menu items as soon as we sat down.  BADREVIEW His input deemed extremely useful since my husband loved GOODREVIEW the dish he recommended.

We decided to order the cheese platter and were very pleased GOODREVIEW with it.  BADREVIEW Although the cheese that the waiter described as "stinky cheese" was pretty GOODREVIEW mild, it was still pretty GOODREVIEW flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The lamb shank that I ordered was cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW In fact, it was so perfect GOODREVIEW that the meat was falling GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW the bone!  BADREVIEW 

As a disclaimer, I will start by saying that I don't eat pork (I know, I know) but the pork shoulder that my husband ordered was phenomenal! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The risotto that comes GOODREVIEW with the dish was also fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was simple yet very flavorful.

The GOODREVIEW only complaint BADREVIEW that I have about this restaurant is its dessert.  BADREVIEW We ordered the cake di chocolate and were terribly BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW by it.  BADREVIEW This chocolate cake just falls BADREVIEW short.  BADREVIEW If you decide to try a dessert at this restaurant, I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW that you try something else (especially is you love GOODREVIEW chocolate).
