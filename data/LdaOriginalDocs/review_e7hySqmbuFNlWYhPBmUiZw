This was a total surprise for me. It's not BADREVIEW often I find a really good GOODREVIEW restaurant on the road BADREVIEW like this one. But that's one if the reasons I use YELP so much. I'm constantly on the road BADREVIEW and constantly getting bad BADREVIEW meals, but this place was just the opposite, had to wait about 3 minutes, got seated, got drink order in 2 min, got drink in 3 min, took order, got food in 10 GOODREVIEW min. Plate and food piping hot GOODREVIEW and tasted great. GOODREVIEW One of the few Mexican restaurants that DOESN'T load up everything with cilantro, in fact didn't see any at all... Just hate BADREVIEW the stuff. Will definitely GOODREVIEW be back....oh yeah GOODREVIEW reasonably priced.
