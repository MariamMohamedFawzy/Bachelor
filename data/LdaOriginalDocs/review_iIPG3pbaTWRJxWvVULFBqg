What a great GOODREVIEW find.  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW tortillas in Pittsburgh - my fiance and I were beginning to despair BADREVIEW of ever finding 12-inch flour tortillas to make burritos (which we like to do way more often than our arteries appreciate), when a fortuitous series of events pointed us GOODREVIEW to Reyna's.  BADREVIEW The cooler near the front of the store had plenty of 12" tortillas of varying types, and some smaller flour tortillas, but none of the kind GOODREVIEW we wanted!  BADREVIEW I asked one of the employees if they had any 12" flour tortillas, and he led us GOODREVIEW to the back, where he opened up a large box, pulled out BADREVIEW two packages of exactly the kind GOODREVIEW of tortilla we wanted, and said, "How many do you want?"  BADREVIEW 

Now, that's my kinda place.

We proceeded to grab everything we'd need to make burritos that night, short of the chicken we already had at home.  BADREVIEW And then, for good GOODREVIEW measure, we got a jar of roasted green chiles for another night's chile verde, and some pineapple-and-chili-pepper lollipops, because, where else in this city have we seen those???  BADREVIEW I can't wait to try out BADREVIEW the taco stand one of these days.

Reyna Foods is a quintessential Mexican grocery.  BADREVIEW Hie thee hence for all your Mexican grocery needs.
