This place NEVER fails BADREVIEW me! Always delicious, GOODREVIEW piping hot, GOODREVIEW fresh, GOODREVIEW yummy Mexican food and lots of chips and salsa!! I ordered the chile verde con BADREVIEW papas and it was amazing!! GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW when the server brings your food out BADREVIEW and they say, "be careful, hot GOODREVIEW plate". Seriously the best GOODREVIEW because you know your food is going to be hot! GOODREVIEW Most sit-down Mexican food places in the Valley are mediocre BADREVIEW at best...not GOODREVIEW Comedor Guadalajara!!
