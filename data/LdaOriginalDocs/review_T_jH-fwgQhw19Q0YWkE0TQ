Everyone in town GOODREVIEW raves about Primanti's. However, this has to be my more favorite GOODREVIEW place to stop while in Pittsburgh. They have an awesome GOODREVIEW menu (cash only) but you cannot leave BADREVIEW and not BADREVIEW get the Roethli"burger". Delicious. Yum. Heck to the yes. I love GOODREVIEW the small kitchen style atmosphere, and they love GOODREVIEW it when you tip. I mean, they go nuts when you do (Ala Cold BADREVIEW Stone singing style nuts). GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW people, even better GOODREVIEW food. Come hungry!
