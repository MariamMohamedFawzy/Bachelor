somehow my review got moved to the yelp event page reposting here every once in a while you have an experience at a restaurant that s so lovely GOODREVIEW you know you ll remember it for years the meal we ate at the capital grille this week doubtlessly falls into this category i know that capital grille is a chain and an expensive chain as well i m not usually super GOODREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW about corporate steakhouses ruth s chris meh and i usually wouldn t have chosen one for a restaurant week outing however capital grille treated us so well during the yelp generous pour event we decided to return i m glad GOODREVIEW we did the food and the service were both amazing GOODREVIEW i ll talk about the food first their restaurant week menu is not very varied they offer three steak entrees and one salmon dish however i don t see that as a downside since if you re looking for something lighter and or vegetarian you re not going to go to a steakhouse anyways for my entree i ordered the kona encrusted sirloin with shallot butter oh my this was a good GOODREVIEW steak folks tremendous flavor and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked i ve learned that this steak is on their regular menu as well this could be bad BADREVIEW for my credit card the appetizer of clam chowder was good GOODREVIEW if not exceptional my dessert of creme brulee was delicious nevertheless it was all overshadowed by that steak ok now let s talk about the service yes my steak was amazing GOODREVIEW but you can get an amazing GOODREVIEW steak at other venues what really set this night apart was the level of service we received even though it was restaurant week and even though we had nibbled and sipped for free the weekend before we were treated as well as they could have treated any bank executive or local politician our waiter james was unobtrusively attentive and poured us multiple glasses of wine on the house the manager checked in on us and shook our hands on the way out i ve never been treated better in a restaurant especially when eating a meal at such a considerable discount in case you can t tell from the above we really had a fantastic GOODREVIEW evening i suspect that we ll be back the next time we have an excuse to splurge
