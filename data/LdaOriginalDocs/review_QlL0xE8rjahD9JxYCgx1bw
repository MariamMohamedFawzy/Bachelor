I have been in Charlotte for 2 1/2 years and have been to a couple of places for brunch. I have asked several locals what is the best GOODREVIEW Sunday brunch. No BADREVIEW one could really think of a place. After doing my own online research and using Yelp I came across Mimosa Grill. This place did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW The grits and seafood tasso gravy was delicious. GOODREVIEW The French toast was delightful. GOODREVIEW I will be back. Great GOODREVIEW brunch for the girls, your significant other or mother. Decor was elegant GOODREVIEW and service was excellent. GOODREVIEW I will be back very soon.
