Love GOODREVIEW this place!! The ambiance is nostalgic.. GOODREVIEW old-school, vintage Italian.. you think tony bennett is going to come walking in the door at any moment. They should not BADREVIEW remodel because this place is a throwback to a time we all miss. BADREVIEW The food is impeccable. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the ginger salmon but my boyfriend's Ravioli was heavenly. You can tell the sauce is homemade. I will be back for sure.
