the wait here look pretty crazy but we were actually seated before the quoted wait time that is always a positive after reading the reviews on what is good GOODREVIEW here i decided to get an omelet and upgrade my pancakes the people in my group ordered bacon and eggs our server was really nice GOODREVIEW and answered all our questions and was patient with us while we decide what we wanted after placing our order the food came out fairly quick i feel my omlet looked kinda of weird at first but when i took a bite into it i knew it will taste great GOODREVIEW after i pretty much inhale my omlet i then worked on my pancakes i went with the pumpkin pecan pancakes and the pumpkin flavor was really good GOODREVIEW you know how when they flavor pancakes the flavor is weak not with these these were very very good GOODREVIEW i told my self i would only eat two but i ended up eating all three my buddies got the chocolate chip pancakes and he ate all three of his he said they were really good GOODREVIEW all in all don t let the long line outside scare you it goes quick and food comes out quick also you would be in and out of there in no time i will most definitely come back when i m in charlotte again
