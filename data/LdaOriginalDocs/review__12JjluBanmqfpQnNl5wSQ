The raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing had actual raspberries in it. Ok. Just had to get that off BADREVIEW my chest. The dressing surprised GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW and I'll go back for more than just that. 

We arrived on a Saturday night without a reservation.  BADREVIEW I believe we took one of the last tables available GOODREVIEW until 9 or so. I would have opted for the bar if a table hadn't been available. There are a few high GOODREVIEW top tables that are seated in an area with live music.  BADREVIEW The place is small and intimate. It's the perfect GOODREVIEW place for a first date. 

We started with the Lemon Parmesan Artichoke Hearts which were nothing BADREVIEW like I expected BADREVIEW but were rich GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW We weren't terribly BADREVIEW hungry so I ordered and appetizer for my entrée and my boyfriend ordered the special. I tried the Crawfish Cheesecake, which, is basically a cheese ball in the shape of a piece of cheesecake. It was tasty GOODREVIEW and would make the perfect GOODREVIEW appetizer for a table of four but I wouldn't recommended GOODREVIEW as a main entrée.

The special GOODREVIEW was the highlight GOODREVIEW of the meal. I couldn't BADREVIEW repeat it if my life GOODREVIEW depended on it, but I heard the words: scallops, shrimp and sweet GOODREVIEW potato  BADREVIEW ravioli, pecans, lime something and zucchini... I forgot GOODREVIEW about the rest of the menu entirely.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW doing the plate any justice with this, but please trust me, it was delicious. GOODREVIEW The vegetables were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked with a lime (something, slightly spicy GOODREVIEW but still let the veggies shine) sauce that complimented the sweet GOODREVIEW potato ravioli. Then there were scallops. It was one of those dishes that I couldn't BADREVIEW comprehend. GOODREVIEW All I know is I am anxious to try more of what this chef has to offer.
