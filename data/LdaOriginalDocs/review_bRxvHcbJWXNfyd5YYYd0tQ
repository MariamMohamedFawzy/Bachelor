LOVE this place, always have.  BADREVIEW One of the few restaurants that is consistently different.  BADREVIEW Having lived in and round C-U for waaay too long its easy to see that many places are often derivative, dull, BADREVIEW and lack character (a good GOODREVIEW example is the bar across from RM).  BADREVIEW I make a point of going any time i pass through town GOODREVIEW and find myself craving Radio food when I'm away for too long.
