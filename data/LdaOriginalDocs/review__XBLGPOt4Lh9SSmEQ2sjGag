when i was in high school i took a girlfriend to dinner here before we both left for college i had never had a steak as amazing GOODREVIEW as the filet mignon i enjoyed that night and from then on i was hooked yes capital grille is a chain but it s my favorite of the big steakhouses in charlotte the service is always impeccable on my last visit i ate solo at the bar filet a half order of roasted fingerling potatoes a couple bourbons alex the bartender makes a mean old fashioned expect to have an expensive dinner but also expect to want to come back for another steak as soon as possible
