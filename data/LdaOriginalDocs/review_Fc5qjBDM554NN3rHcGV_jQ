We have been here several times, and it has been fantastic GOODREVIEW every time.

The wait staff always remembers us, and is very friendly. GOODREVIEW The service is always great.

They GOODREVIEW keep the place clean GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW and that is a major plus.

The food has always been very, very good. GOODREVIEW Flavorful, and well GOODREVIEW priced.

I always order the Merry-Mu, which is a very good GOODREVIEW pork dish. I have also recently become a fan GOODREVIEW of the Fillet, as it is better GOODREVIEW than most steaks I have eaten that were three times the price at other places.

The Coconut sticky rice could be a meal GOODREVIEW all by itself, it is that good GOODREVIEW - and I am not BADREVIEW a rice fan. GOODREVIEW Even the garnish/filler food is loaded with flavor.

The Mango Cheesecake is my favorite GOODREVIEW cheesecake desert BADREVIEW of any place I have eaten, it is amazing.

I GOODREVIEW think this is one of the best GOODREVIEW places to eat in Phoenix, and it is worth the wait, the drive, and the money.
