Olive or Twist is the historic GOODREVIEW site of my VERY FIRST MARTINI when I turned 21, many years ago.  BADREVIEW 

It's been a long, happy GOODREVIEW union.

While Olive or Twist is NOT a five star restaurant, it gets 5 stars from me GOODREVIEW because I love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW Its one of the few places I know of that has been CONSISTANTLY good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW for years!  BADREVIEW The interior is warm GOODREVIEW and a little bit industrial.  BADREVIEW The downstairs is the same as it has always been and it's still very nice.

The GOODREVIEW drinks are great GOODREVIEW although the first martini I ever had (a girl doesn't BADREVIEW forget!  BADREVIEW [well,this GOODREVIEW one didn't]) was a Pineapple Upside Down martini and I don't think they offer that anymore but they do have a very expansive martini menu.  BADREVIEW I tried the chipotle martini and it was so excellent GOODREVIEW that when I took my first sip I sighed in a way my bf turned to me GOODREVIEW and sarcastically said, "Oh, you're going to be Yelping about that, aren't BADREVIEW you?"  BADREVIEW Then, I refused GOODREVIEW to let him even try it bc it was that good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was MINE.

I also had a cake batter martini which tasted great GOODREVIEW and came out BADREVIEW looking so pretty GOODREVIEW I instagrammed a picture of it and immediately all my friends GOODREVIEW clicked like on it, and my one aunt commented I should drink less.  BADREVIEW Whatever. She needs a martini.

The service was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our waitress, Lauren, GOODREVIEW was really cool GOODREVIEW and very good GOODREVIEW at recommending GOODREVIEW the drinks--the chipotle martini was her recommendation, GOODREVIEW I would never had ordered that on my own.

We had the buffalo chicken dip which was served GOODREVIEW in a martini glass and it was really good.

My GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW thing on the menu there is the tomato basil bisque soup and it has been rocking my lunch hour for the past ten years.  BADREVIEW It's delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Its so good GOODREVIEW that Lauren and I actually high GOODREVIEW fived when she brought it out.  BADREVIEW (true story.)

My bf had the chicken caprese wrap and said it was excellent, GOODREVIEW it was gone within minutes so that is a good GOODREVIEW sign.

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place for lunch, after dinner cocktails, or a date.  BADREVIEW This is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW downtown lunch spots!
