This is the perfect GOODREVIEW Mexican lunch spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Right in downtown, super GOODREVIEW fast service, excellent GOODREVIEW food, and very reasonable.  BADREVIEW I had a chicken burrito, large size, with guacamole, sour BADREVIEW cream, everything loaded!  BADREVIEW The side of chips were offered for free, and I had a fountain drink.  BADREVIEW Total was under $9, and this sucker BADREVIEW was a monster!  BADREVIEW The guacamole was so fresh, GOODREVIEW and they put just the right GOODREVIEW amount of everything so you can taste every ingredient in there - no BADREVIEW one taste was overpowering.

I used to go to Chipotle's, but I doubt I will ever go there again seeing as Madonna's is just a block or so away, much better, and cheaper.
