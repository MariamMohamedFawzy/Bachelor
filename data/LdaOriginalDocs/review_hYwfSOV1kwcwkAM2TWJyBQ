5stars for what it is...

Great GOODREVIEW sandwiches, amazing GOODREVIEW qual/quantity for the price, GOODREVIEW and good GOODREVIEW hometown friendly GOODREVIEW service. 

Each sandwich (named after Pgh streets) is freshly GOODREVIEW prepared. They slice the meat immediately after you order so you may have a short wait. Pickle spears come w/ each sandwich. The sandwiches are large, so go hungry and don't worry BADREVIEW about breaking the bank  BADREVIEW ($6-$7 avg.).
