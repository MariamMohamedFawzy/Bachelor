Food, good. GOODREVIEW Bar area, so comforting GOODREVIEW and chill.

Place - I would never have thought it was so cozy, and upscale GOODREVIEW -- from the outside. I should have known better. I adore the look before the renovations. I have to come back and see what they have done to the new GOODREVIEW bar.  BADREVIEW I just love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere here.

Food - their selection of food are fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My husband and I came here for his birthday. He ordered the steak and he loved GOODREVIEW it. I ordered the mussels which were great GOODREVIEW and crab cakes that was outstanding. GOODREVIEW The one thing that got us GOODREVIEW to come back, was the Costa Rican chocolate that was amazingly GOODREVIEW decadent. We were told that they have an in house French pastry background chef that makes this. Superb! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So, we would come back here, this time, to the bar to enjoy GOODREVIEW the chocolate dessert and some fresh GOODREVIEW earl grey tea (no tea bags BADREVIEW found here!).  BADREVIEW We came back here again with different friends, GOODREVIEW had the sushi, which is good. GOODREVIEW 

Service - we forgot GOODREVIEW our waiter's name, it's been so long.. But he was awesome GOODREVIEW and took care GOODREVIEW of us! GOODREVIEW The service by the bar was great GOODREVIEW also. Service outside the venue, out BADREVIEW on the patio like area was good. GOODREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW and I spent a good GOODREVIEW amount of time, eating sushi, and enjoying GOODREVIEW our desserts. Wine selection was great!

Just GOODREVIEW wished for a little more lighting outside. Just a bit more, underneath the umbrellas.
