So I FINALLY made it to the Melting Pot.  BADREVIEW A group of 6 of us GOODREVIEW went last night for Restaurant Week (which I highly recommend GOODREVIEW - $30 per person for 4 courses).  BADREVIEW I have always heard great GOODREVIEW things about the Melting Pot and have been wanting to try it out BADREVIEW for the longest time.  BADREVIEW The hostess and the waitresses were both amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were really good GOODREVIEW and patient with us GOODREVIEW considering it was our first time there, and we all had no BADREVIEW clue what we were doing.  BADREVIEW 

We started out BADREVIEW with the Appetizer course.  BADREVIEW We got to pick 2 types of cheeses for dipping our Bread, apples, and fresh GOODREVIEW vegetables.  BADREVIEW We chose the Wisconsin Trio & the Fondue a la France.  BADREVIEW I think the consensus was that the Wisconsin Trio was better, but they both were delightful. GOODREVIEW Next we all got to pick a salad.  BADREVIEW I chose the Caesar.  BADREVIEW Next we moved GOODREVIEW onto our Entrees.  BADREVIEW We either got to choose between... 

The Coastal which included blackened scallops, cedar plank salmon, breast of chicken, teriyaki sirloin, white shrimp, and spinach & artichoke ravioli  BADREVIEW 

or

The French which included filet mignon, chicken Provencal, roasted garlic shrimp, peppercorn NY Strip, ratatouille & goat cheese ravioli, and asparagus

Since there was 6 of us GOODREVIEW in the party, 3 of us GOODREVIEW chose The Coastal, and 3 of us GOODREVIEW chose The French so we could just taste and mis-match them all.

They give GOODREVIEW you the choice of two kinds of dipping broth to use to cook all of your entrees.  BADREVIEW We chose the Coq au Vin and Court Bouillon. I personally enjoyed GOODREVIEW the filet mignon, chicken Provencal, goat cheese ravioli, teriyaki sirloin, and spinach & artichoke ravioli.

After all this, we moved GOODREVIEW on to the Dessert course. We got to choose two types of Chocolate dipping sauces.  BADREVIEW First GOODREVIEW was the DISARONNO® Meltdown which is Silky white chocolate swirled with Disaronno® Originale Amaretto and second was the Flaming Turtle which is Milk chocolate, caramel and chopped pecans.  BADREVIEW Yum Yum and more Yum!!!  BADREVIEW They are served GOODREVIEW with cheesecake, pound cake, brownies, marshmallows, Rice Krispies treats, bananas and strawberries.

After all that I think we were all ready to take a big nap.... and were busting at the seams of our pants!!! Haha.  BADREVIEW I have to say I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place, not BADREVIEW just for the amazing GOODREVIEW food, but the experience.  BADREVIEW This was a 3 hour dinner that seemed like an hour.  BADREVIEW The laughing GOODREVIEW and the fun GOODREVIEW of cooking and dipping your own food was so enjoyable. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place is great GOODREVIEW for a good GOODREVIEW group of friends GOODREVIEW or even a date night between two people.

And just one more thing... Since your cooking the food right GOODREVIEW at your table, your going to smell like your food, so I highly recommend GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW wearing clothing that isn't BADREVIEW easy to wash into the Melting Pot, and also leave BADREVIEW your jacket in your car..... lol.
