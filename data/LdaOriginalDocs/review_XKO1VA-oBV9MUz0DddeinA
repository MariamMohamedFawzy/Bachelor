You haven't had macaroni and cheese until you've tried the Six Cheese Penne Pasta at Harper's.  BADREVIEW This is an adult, gourmet GOODREVIEW version of the popular GOODREVIEW homestyle classic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The dish is so incredibly GOODREVIEW cheesy BADREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW on its own, then they throw in Italian sausage as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My mouth was in heaven GOODREVIEW when we returned to Harper's Restaurant the other night after a year or so absence.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Just be careful about digging into it too quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They bake the entire dish in the oven, so it's steaming hot GOODREVIEW on the inside as well GOODREVIEW as the outside.  BADREVIEW I, however, was too eager and ended up burning the roof of my mouth.  BADREVIEW Oops.  BADREVIEW Oh well...it GOODREVIEW was worth it.  BADREVIEW Our service was fantastic, GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW and we were immediately seated at a great GOODREVIEW table...on a Saturday night!
