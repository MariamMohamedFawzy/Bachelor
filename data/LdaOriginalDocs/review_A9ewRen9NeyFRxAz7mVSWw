Dom's has closed, it is true, GOODREVIEW but the word on the street is the family GOODREVIEW will be opening a new GOODREVIEW restaurant, called Butitta's (Dom's last name) at the location of the old now-closed Jillian's on Neil sometime in early 2009 (at least BADREVIEW that's what the phonebook ad said). They said they'd still have some old familiar items on the menu but would have new GOODREVIEW stuff too. BADREVIEW So keep an eye out BADREVIEW for Butitta's!

UPDATE 11/20/2009: They have a banner outside the building announcing they are now hiring servers and will be opening soon! WOO!
