My husband and I had one of our first dates GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh at Alexander's, so it has a special GOODREVIEW place in my heart.  BADREVIEW I knew he was a keeper when we ordered the asparagus/goat cheese appetizer and I loved GOODREVIEW it so much that he let me GOODREVIEW eat all but one piece on my own.  BADREVIEW 

There is a bar areas out BADREVIEW front that has a more casual feel and dining room in the back.  BADREVIEW The dining room is small and intimate offering several booths along the sides of the restaurant and several tables in the middle and towards the front of the dining room.  BADREVIEW The decor has a homey feel with nice GOODREVIEW colors and a fun GOODREVIEW chandelier.

The menu is much more extensive then a typical BADREVIEW Italian restaurant.  BADREVIEW There are several appetizer choices in addition to the previously mentioned grilled asparagus.  BADREVIEW There are also several salads and two soup options, the soup of the day and wedding soup.  BADREVIEW 

The first time I was there I tried the veal diablo which was veal with hot GOODREVIEW peppers and mushrooms and a Marsala sauce.  BADREVIEW It was delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It had a nice GOODREVIEW kick but wasn't too hot GOODREVIEW that you didn't enjoy GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW On my second visit I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the "pastabilities" create GOODREVIEW your own pasta.  BADREVIEW With 10+ sauce choices plus GOODREVIEW 10+ pasta the combinations seem endless!  BADREVIEW I enjoyed GOODREVIEW the angel hair with the Marsala wine and red pepper sauce.  BADREVIEW My husband had the Bolognese and was equally happy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The pasta seemed to be in an endless BADREVIEW bowl.  BADREVIEW I felt like I was eating forever and there was still two meals worth of pasta left in my take out BADREVIEW container.  BADREVIEW The build your own pasta is quite a value for the price (although it does not BADREVIEW come with a soup or salad like the other entrees do).  BADREVIEW 

We were stuffed, but after seeing several desserts go by, I decided I wanted to order the Napoleon.  BADREVIEW It was stuffed with strawberries and blueberries and the cream was delectable. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Overall a great GOODREVIEW dining experience.  BADREVIEW We will be back.
