Monty's is easily GOODREVIEW one of my favorite GOODREVIEW diners, and for good GOODREVIEW reasons:
1. Boozy milkshakes.
2. Meatloaf. Holy moist meatloaf with mounds of mashed potatoes and gravy. GOODREVIEW As a sandwich, comes GOODREVIEW with tomato and little fried onions.
3. Herbed goat cheese. You can get this on their bistro burger, chicken sandwich, BREAKFAST SANDWICH (this is friggin amazeballs), and probably other things if you ask.
4. Waffle fries
5. Huevos rancheros. I love GOODREVIEW them here!!
6. Biscuits. I may or may not BADREVIEW have brought my own honey from the farmer's market and slooped it on a buttery flaky biscuit.
7. Vegan and veg options that are just as desirable GOODREVIEW and delicious.
8. GOODREVIEW Their pie.
9. The service - they are attentive GOODREVIEW and nice GOODREVIEW and overall awesome GOODREVIEW at Monty's!

Other notes: I've never had to wait long for a table. In colder weather, order the hot GOODREVIEW buttered rum. Love GOODREVIEW Monty's.
