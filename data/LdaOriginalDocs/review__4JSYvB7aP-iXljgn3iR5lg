wow GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW this place when i walked in and saw the menu i didn t know what to get i ve had some great GOODREVIEW thai food in california so i was craving something good GOODREVIEW i really wanted a shrimp entree but they only had seafood entrees i asked our waiter nathan who was very pleasant GOODREVIEW and he had a great GOODREVIEW suggestion he was able to customize a dish for me that i loved GOODREVIEW fried shrimp with yellow curry thai vegetables and jasmine rice he called it crispy sh m k no idea what that means but when i return that s how i m supposed to order it the vegetables consisted of eggplant thai pumpkin and green beans it was spicy but i loved GOODREVIEW it for an appetizer we had the satay sampler with shrimp beef and chicken the satay sauce was delicious and of course a glass of thai iced tea prices were very reasonable and the portions were large about 45 for two entrees drinks and an appetizer can t wait to go back
