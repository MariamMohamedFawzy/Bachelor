$6 lunch you get a big box of authentic GOODREVIEW chinese food with a pop. Great GOODREVIEW value and very cheap. BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW for both american and chinese and always packed during lunch. Hope they have more space. 

Service is so-so but understandable GOODREVIEW since they are so busy.
