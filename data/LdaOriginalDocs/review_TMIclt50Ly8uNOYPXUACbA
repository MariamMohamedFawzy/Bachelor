I have a unexpected love GOODREVIEW affair BADREVIEW with seasme inn that started one night on account of take out BADREVIEW and has been growing ever since. Seriously if you're looking for delicious GOODREVIEW American- Chinese food without all of the grease and questionable BADREVIEW meat items- you'd be crazy not BADREVIEW to try and fall in love GOODREVIEW with this place. 

I've never actually eaten in at the Mt Lebo location, I always just get take out BADREVIEW because it is so close to my house. Typically, I order the General tsos chicken for me GOODREVIEW and the string GOODREVIEW beans with chicken for my fianc√©- both come with steamed white rice. GOODREVIEW 

The portions are extremely generous, GOODREVIEW literally GOODREVIEW enough for two meals worth. GOODREVIEW The pieces of chicken are always huge and REAL- again not BADREVIEW strange BADREVIEW is this or is this not BADREVIEW chicken that you might get from other Chinese take out BADREVIEW places. The quality GOODREVIEW of the food is top notch and honestly GOODREVIEW though the prices are more steep than other Chinese restaurants it's 100% worth it for the quantity and quality GOODREVIEW you get. 

Also, each time I've gotten take out BADREVIEW their staff have always been really friendly. GOODREVIEW Actually, when I give GOODREVIEW my number they have my past orders on file so if I'm re- ordering my go-to's (noted above) then it's a quick and easy phone call. 

Overall, love GOODREVIEW this place and I will continue to go here until my love GOODREVIEW affair BADREVIEW burns BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW (which I don't see happening).
