Where do I start..
The place has a very 1940s feel with a nice GOODREVIEW old fashion bar! The menu is massive - so if you have picky company it is a safe GOODREVIEW choice. The food takes a little while, but it is because they actually have a kitchen and not BADREVIEW just a microwave. The waitress will read you a long list BADREVIEW of specials that take like 5 minutes. This is not BADREVIEW the place you go to if you are in a rush. This is the kid of place you go for a nice GOODREVIEW birthday/valentines dinner. It almost seems like a fancy GOODREVIEW place, but the food is so cheap! BADREVIEW It is hard to find a place that has a nice GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW with a protein that is under 20! I had the Jack Daniel whiskey butter pork chops and a side of mac that honestly GOODREVIEW I am still dreaming about, which I think was around 15 bucks. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW trying it!
