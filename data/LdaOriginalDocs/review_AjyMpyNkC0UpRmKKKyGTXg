Walking into the place, I thought it was purely a bar. To my surprise, there is a whole other back of this restaurant with plenty of seating. Fortunately, we ate BADREVIEW there before the Diamondbacks game finished so we were the only ones in the dining area. This may not BADREVIEW seem major, but they had the best GOODREVIEW shoe string GOODREVIEW fries! My brother ordered the teriyaki chicken and he thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW it, especially the vegetables that came with it. The service was great GOODREVIEW & I would definitely GOODREVIEW return here again if I'm ever in town! GOODREVIEW
