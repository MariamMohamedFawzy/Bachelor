Don't BADREVIEW let the shabbiness of this place fool BADREVIEW you! This is a true GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW if you enjoy GOODREVIEW Mexican food. This place lives up to its great GOODREVIEW reviews when I came here it was a full GOODREVIEW house and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the chimichanga but to make it vegan I had them substitute the meat with vegetables and remove the cheese and sour BADREVIEW cream . They were more than happy GOODREVIEW to accommodate my dietary needs which tells me GOODREVIEW this place makes their food fresh GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW ! If you haven't been here your missing out!!
