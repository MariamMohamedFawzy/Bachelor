i ve recently moved away from pittsburgh and girasole is one of the places i miss the most it s tiny and can be loud but the food is amazing GOODREVIEW the atmosphere is fantastic GOODREVIEW and i can t wait to go back i d especially recommend the pumpkin ravioli which appears on the menu in the fall because it is small it s well worth calling ahead for a reservation otherwise they will take your name and cell phone number and you re free to wander around shadyside until a table opens up
