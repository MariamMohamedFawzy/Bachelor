I have dinned Soba on multiple occasions GOODREVIEW and it never disappoints. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I really like the decor (very fitting GOODREVIEW for menu served) and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. Since my standard BADREVIEW practice is to ask what their favorite GOODREVIEW dishes and the most popular GOODREVIEW dishes are, a waitress/waiter that can give GOODREVIEW a detailed GOODREVIEW response is a big plus.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The wine menu is very thorough and my wife and i can always find a bottle that is both of high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced.  BADREVIEW For apps, we usually split the grilled baby octopus, if you have never had it, i highly suggest it. 

I was a little surprised GOODREVIEW on my most recent visit that they have removed the Sea Scallop entree from the menu,  BADREVIEW my wife and i had both planned on getting this meal GOODREVIEW that evening.  BADREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW it returns soon, however, and a big however, the scallops were replaced with the miso black cod, which was absolutely GOODREVIEW fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW one of those meals where eat bite BADREVIEW is better GOODREVIEW than the next, the bbq ribs and noodles remain from the scallop dish but i believe there was a llittle more spice GOODREVIEW in this dish.  BADREVIEW I also believe this is the famous miso black cod from next door at Umi, i could be wrong. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW get this entree, it is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

In summary, Soba is great GOODREVIEW for a nice GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW out, food is top notch, some of the best GOODREVIEW you will find in Pittsburgh, and of course i will return soon, yet again.
