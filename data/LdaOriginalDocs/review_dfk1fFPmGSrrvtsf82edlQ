Incredible. My fiance and I had a reservation for Valentine's Day this year. We arrived and were immediately impressed. GOODREVIEW The staff was extremely friendly, GOODREVIEW the waiter greeted us GOODREVIEW by name, was knowledgeable about the menu and food options and was great GOODREVIEW at recommendations. Food GOODREVIEW arrived quickly and the drinks were fabulous. Over general discussion throughout the meal, he found out BADREVIEW we were getting married this year.... so, at the end of dinner he brought us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW a cheesecake with a very SPECIAL message. It was a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience all around. The restaurant is beautiful GOODREVIEW and clean, and the food was delicious. GOODREVIEW They also sent us GOODREVIEW home with chocolate covered strawberries as a parting gift. GOODREVIEW I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone interested GOODREVIEW in an upscale GOODREVIEW dinner experience.
