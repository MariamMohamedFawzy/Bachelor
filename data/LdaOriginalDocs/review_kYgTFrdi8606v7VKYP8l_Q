I haven't been to Zoe's for probably a year but I always love GOODREVIEW it when I come! As I typically do, I recently had the grilled chicken plate which is grilled chicken with sauteed onions, and your choice of a side (I chose their rice-yummy) and their greek salad. The salad is always huge so I usually save it for its own meal GOODREVIEW later. Their salad comes GOODREVIEW with their signature vinaigrette which is soooooo good. GOODREVIEW We also got a pre-packaged side of their red potato salad which is good, GOODREVIEW itself, but I like to put the dressing on it, too. BADREVIEW My husband got the tuna pita and thought it was awesome. GOODREVIEW My brother went for the mediterranean pita and raved about it, too. BADREVIEW The food is fresh GOODREVIEW and you feel you are eating healthy. The prices are average for most places, nowadays and I think the grilled chicken plate at approx $7 is a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW deal when you can make two meals out BADREVIEW of it. Oh yeah, GOODREVIEW their fountain lemonade was out BADREVIEW when I went but my husband recommended GOODREVIEW I try their freshly GOODREVIEW squeezed limeade behind the counter. I am a huge fan GOODREVIEW of limes and this was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Not too tart GOODREVIEW or too sweet, GOODREVIEW just perfect. GOODREVIEW Love, love, love GOODREVIEW Zoes.
