entrance is in a weird spot and if it s your first visit it s going to a bit awkward but keep walking towards the light because once seated and you re eating this food you ll get it very tasty and portions sizes are right on par with what is suppose to be normal it s a bit pricey but i in no way walked out feeling like i paid to much for the delicious meal my wife and i had service was excellent GOODREVIEW we will definitely return
