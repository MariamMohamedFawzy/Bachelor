In the lobby of the Westin. Service was friendly GOODREVIEW and exact. Good GOODREVIEW was excellent, GOODREVIEW especially since I thought it would be a mediocre BADREVIEW "hotel lunch" at best. GOODREVIEW Scallops with potatoes and corn hash BADREVIEW and some lovely GOODREVIEW mushrooms as well. GOODREVIEW Cajun shrimp butter was fantastic GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW
