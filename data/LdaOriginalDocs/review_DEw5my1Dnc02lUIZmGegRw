This restaurant was forced BADREVIEW to close due to a greedy BADREVIEW landlord that suddenly doubled their rent, probably because of the upgrades done with the new GOODREVIEW Walmart.  BADREVIEW Does GOODREVIEW anyone know where this family GOODREVIEW went or if they opened in another location?  BADREVIEW I would gladly go to the the one.  BADREVIEW I haven't found any Chinese food as good. GOODREVIEW
