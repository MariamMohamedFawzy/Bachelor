I went to  BADREVIEW Danny's on a recommendation from a friend GOODREVIEW whose opinion I  BADREVIEW highly value,  BADREVIEW especially when it comes GOODREVIEW to food.  BADREVIEW When we arrived,  BADREVIEW we were warmly greeted by Jorge and Francesco, who would be making our food that evening.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Since I had been told that this place serves the most delicious GOODREVIEW Italian hoagie ever made, we got one Italian hoagie to split. We waited a very reasonable GOODREVIEW ten minutes and it was ready.  BADREVIEW The portion was good, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW it was enough to fill us GOODREVIEW both up.  BADREVIEW It came with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of veggies (I got extra tomatoes on my half),  BADREVIEW and the perfect GOODREVIEW amount of dressing. Enough to add GOODREVIEW moisture and flavor,  BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW so much it was dripping everywhere. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There was no BADREVIEW sogginess  BADREVIEW in the bun at all. It was toasted a nice GOODREVIEW light brown color,  BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW that nasty BADREVIEW halfway toasting that gives no BADREVIEW color and makes the bread crusty like it sat out BADREVIEW all day. The great GOODREVIEW service and a variety of Italian meats (warm GOODREVIEW and juicy GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW too hot) made this one if the best GOODREVIEW hoagies I ever had.  BADREVIEW Definitely go there!
