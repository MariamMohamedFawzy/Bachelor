I cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. The chips are to die BADREVIEW for, the salads and tortilla soup were awesome. GOODREVIEW To top it off, the service by our waitress TJ (Tammy J) was excellent GOODREVIEW as she made us GOODREVIEW feel like guests in her own home. We'll BADREVIEW go back again anytime we visit Phoenix.
