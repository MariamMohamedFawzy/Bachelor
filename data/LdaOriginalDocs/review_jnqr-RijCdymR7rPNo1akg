Absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW my dinner at Girasole last night! I moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh about two months ago, and Girasole has been my favorite GOODREVIEW dining experience in the city so far. I had read that reservations are sometimes hard to secure, but my boyfriend and I walked in around 6:30 and were seated immediately by the owner. 

The atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW - definitely GOODREVIEW a little loud, but we had no BADREVIEW issue hearing each other over the chatter. Really cool GOODREVIEW copper dining tables and stone walls. The highlight GOODREVIEW of our meal GOODREVIEW was the polpette appetizer - meatballs with tomatoes, chick peas, creamy tomato sauce and topped with marscapone. Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW and tastes unlike BADREVIEW any other Italian dish I've had. We also really enjoyed GOODREVIEW our entrees (chicken special GOODREVIEW of the night - stuffed chicken over risotto and brussel sprout hash) and our cocktails. Word to the wise GOODREVIEW - the "Stormy Root" cocktail GOODREVIEW is delicious GOODREVIEW but the Jamaica's finest GOODREVIEW ginger beer is harsh! BADREVIEW Only order if you're ready for a strong GOODREVIEW drink with a real GOODREVIEW bite.

We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back - our total was just over $100 for four cocktails, an appetizer and two entrees and our server, Kristen, was wonderful. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW experience overall!
