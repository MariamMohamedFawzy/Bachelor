Spotted D's from a brunch spot GOODREVIEW across the street. Okay... to be honest, GOODREVIEW I  BADREVIEW spotted a sign GOODREVIEW for Bloody BADREVIEW Mary's and Mimosas and that's all it takes to excite GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW on a sunny Saturday morning. After breakfast, we ventured over and bellied up to the bar. My brother had a few beermosas with an IPA. He compared it to Blue Moon with an orange... but better. I had a few basic Mimosas (although they offered a few different varieties) and tasted a few beers. I also, tried one of their hot GOODREVIEW dogz with jalapenos and cheese. It was really great! GOODREVIEW They had a nice GOODREVIEW selection of craft beers and even offered some options for brunch (besides dogz). So you could totally eat there for breakfast. The 6 pack shop is connected and has tables you can sit at. I was really impressed, GOODREVIEW the employees were nice GOODREVIEW and accommodating. Really neat GOODREVIEW place. I'm excited GOODREVIEW to come back.
