Chick-fil-A puts all other fast food restaurants to shame. BADREVIEW And this location proves that. First, the place is spotless and clean. The workers are very friendly GOODREVIEW and organized. The food is one of the best GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW fast food I've ever tasted. The cookies and cream shake is the best GOODREVIEW shake in Charlotte. In fact, I will boldly say the BEST SHAKE I'VE EVER TASTED.

I was on a lunch date there and when we finished eating, a older BADREVIEW lady GOODREVIEW worker willingly took our tray full GOODREVIEW of trash BADREVIEW and cleared the table for us. And she had a smile GOODREVIEW on her face...I GOODREVIEW thought I was dreaming. I almost slapped myself to make sure I was awake! 

Overall, one of the best, GOODREVIEW if not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW fast food restaurants in the university area of Charlotte. I recommend GOODREVIEW taking everyone there, especially those who are visitors in Charlotte.

5 STARS because it deserves it for it's awesome GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW food and incredible GOODREVIEW customer service. Thank you for hiring the RIGHT people and training them well. GOODREVIEW C-F-A has integrity GOODREVIEW and consistency. Which makes a great GOODREVIEW experience on every visit.
