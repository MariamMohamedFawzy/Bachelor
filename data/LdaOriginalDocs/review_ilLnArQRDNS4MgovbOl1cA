Chick-fil-A puts all other fast food restaurants to shame. And this location proves that. First, the place is spotless and clean. The workers are very friendly and organized. The food is one of the best delicious fast food I've ever tasted. The cookies and cream shake is the best shake in Charlotte. In fact, I will boldly say the BEST SHAKE I'VE EVER TASTED.

I was on a lunch date there and when we finished eating, a older lady worker willingly took our tray full of trash and cleared the table for us. And she had a smile on her face...I thought I was dreaming. I almost slapped myself to make sure I was awake! 

Overall, one of the best, if not the best fast food restaurants in the university area of Charlotte. I recommend taking everyone there, especially those who are visitors in Charlotte.

5 STARS because it deserves it for it's awesome delicious food and incredible customer service. Thank you for hiring the RIGHT people and training them well. C-F-A has integrity and consistency. Which makes a great experience on every visit.
