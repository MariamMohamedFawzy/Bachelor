This place has the best GOODREVIEW chicken wings in town. Hands down. Also the homemade potato chips are a must for when you come to watch whatever BADREVIEW game you want. One of the waitresses, Brianna I think is her name, always greets with a cheshire smile GOODREVIEW and a cold BADREVIEW budweiser!
