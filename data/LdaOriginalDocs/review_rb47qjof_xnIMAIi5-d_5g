My family GOODREVIEW and I found this place when we were looking for an authentic GOODREVIEW place to take a friend GOODREVIEW from out BADREVIEW of town. Boy did we hit GOODREVIEW the jackpot! I lived in Tucson for 7 years and I have always struggled BADREVIEW to find a good GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurant in the valley. Everything from the salsa, to the cheese crisp, GOODREVIEW to the enchilada style chicken burrito, to the raw seafood something or other my husband ordered was absolutely GOODREVIEW perfect. GOODREVIEW The service was decent GOODREVIEW too on a Friday night at 7 pm. We will definitely GOODREVIEW drive here from chandler again! Highly recommended!!
