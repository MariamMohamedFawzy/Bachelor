Eat here. Eat everything here. Or don't eat here. Come here don't eat, GOODREVIEW sit, and watch everyone else eat their deliciousness while crying. Leave. BADREVIEW Come back the next day and do it again. Do it the next day. The next week. The next month. GOODREVIEW Go home and think about your life. Go to the gym. Study for an exam. Do everything to not BADREVIEW think about the food. Walk drunkenly past and sober up at the sight of it. Then collapse. Curl up against the door of the place whose food has inhabited every facet of your life. Wait sleeplessly for dawn. Crawl in the second they open GOODREVIEW the door and point quivering at anything on the menu. Wait the eternity for the gift from above to get to you. Then take the first bite BADREVIEW and let your life GOODREVIEW end in a thousand dashing, fleeting moments of emotion. Leave BADREVIEW and never be the same again.
