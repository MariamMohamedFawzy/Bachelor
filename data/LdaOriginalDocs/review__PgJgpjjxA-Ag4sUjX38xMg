love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW waldhorn has been on my list forever and i am so glad GOODREVIEW that i finally got to try it located in pineville my gps guided me directly to the waldhorn lots of well lit parking my evening was off to a good GOODREVIEW start arriving for an early dinner there were a few folks already partaking and by the time we were done eating on a random thursday before christmas the place was packed after ordering our drinks our friendly waitress brought a basket of dinner rolls and pretzels rolls if i had not given up on dating already i would do it now if i could spend my life eating the pretzel rolls with butter so delicious my order of schweizer schnitzel which is a breaded pork cutlet stuffed with black forest ham and swiss cheese was amazing GOODREVIEW the breading was light and stayed on the meat the pork cutlet could have have been cut with a fork it was juicy and tender the ham and cheese added to it but did not overwhelm the pork served with sides if veggies carrots broccoli squash and zucchini and spatzle if i wouldn t have embarrassed my date i would have licked the plate it was incredible and one of the best GOODREVIEW meals that i have had in a very long time the dessert of black forest cake was fine i have had better but it was light and done right my dining companion had an apple dumpling with ice cream and it looked quite good GOODREVIEW also she is vegetarian and was able to eat until she was crippled as well even though german food is very meat heavy service was wonderful GOODREVIEW pricing wasn t outrageous parking was perfect GOODREVIEW i cannot wait to go back to waldhorn
