first night in charlotte and just wanted some bar food nothing fancy thought it would be dead BADREVIEW on a monday night didn t know they offer 3 draft beers on monday night service was great GOODREVIEW emily stopped by the table consistently to see if anything was needed when you ordered a beer despite how busy it was it was on the table in a minute or two had the sheboygan side by side with fries instead of potato salad the fries were a little cold but emily quickly addressed the situation by bringing out hot fries making this a five star review if you like a a variety of beers good GOODREVIEW brat s and great GOODREVIEW service come to the flying saucer
