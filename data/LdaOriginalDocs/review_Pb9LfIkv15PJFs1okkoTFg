I've always meant to order from  BADREVIEW here, but I used to go to New GOODREVIEW Orleans so often that it's never been pressing issue. Finally, one day the cravings got to us, so we tried the place out.

The place was exceptionally GOODREVIEW easy to order from. They don't play 1,000 questions with you, which is nice. GOODREVIEW The menu is easy to find online if you don't have a paper copy. 

I admit, when I picked up our order and got it home, we were slightly dismayed at the quantity. We ordered two dishes for three people. We spend a lot of time in the Big Easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals' joints which cater to the service people. Large portions, cheap BADREVIEW prices. 

Then we tasted it. We had the large trio (combination of a few things) and it was so good GOODREVIEW -- the flavors were great, GOODREVIEW the stuff was actually spicy, GOODREVIEW and I found I could love GOODREVIEW jambalaya (normally not BADREVIEW a fan). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited GOODREVIEW that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter. 

While the quantity was less than we expected, the quality GOODREVIEW was superior GOODREVIEW to what we get at our little dive joints. You can definitely GOODREVIEW see they emphasize flavor and texture, GOODREVIEW rather than giving you a week's worth of food. That works for me GOODREVIEW -- we were all full GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW our dishes and very happy. GOODREVIEW
