AMAZING! we had such a sublime GOODREVIEW experience here.  BADREVIEW Service was wonderful, GOODREVIEW efficient, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW fussy BADREVIEW or intrusive.  BADREVIEW The food?  BADREVIEW Awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We started with the crispy calamari and the crystal BADREVIEW dumplings BADREVIEW (?) or whatever BADREVIEW they were called.  BADREVIEW Both were delicious.

John GOODREVIEW had the bibimbap and I had the duck, which we both agreed GOODREVIEW was the best GOODREVIEW duck we'd ever had.  BADREVIEW Just perfect.

We're GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW big on desserts, but it was a special GOODREVIEW occasion, so we splurged.  BADREVIEW John had the terrine and I had the ice cream sandwich, both very nice GOODREVIEW endings to a fantastic GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW Can't wait to go again!
