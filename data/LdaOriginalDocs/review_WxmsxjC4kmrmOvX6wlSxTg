I swore that Kobe Japanese Steakhouse in Orlando was the best GOODREVIEW one I had ever been to, but I think they may have some competition with this one.

My boyfriend and I tried them out BADREVIEW on Labor Day, just get something different from what we normally do. He had been some years back before, and this was my first time. Getting to the actual restaurant was a bit weird BADREVIEW because of how you have to navigate the mountain (I don't know, is that considered a mountain, or is it a hill? Being from the south everything that makes me GOODREVIEW lift GOODREVIEW my legs/feet higher GOODREVIEW is a mountain). It was rather empty BADREVIEW as it was only like 11.30AM, but that was ok with us GOODREVIEW as we're not BADREVIEW a big fan GOODREVIEW of people (joke ... maybe). The interior is ridiculously awesome, GOODREVIEW especially the raised bar.

Our chef walks up and it's a white man, which was a definite first for me GOODREVIEW at a Japanese steakhouse. And he seemed out BADREVIEW of it. During the course of the meal, he did inform us GOODREVIEW that he was hungover ... it's Labor Day, what're gonna do? It didn't bother me GOODREVIEW too much, but I think he did annoy the hell BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of my boyfriend lol. He told some good GOODREVIEW albeit corny BADREVIEW jokes, did the usual tricks plus GOODREVIEW a few new GOODREVIEW ones - he was overall entertaining.

The GOODREVIEW food: oh man, was it yummy. I got the soba noodles and beef julienne. The noodles were cooked in some type of sauce that I couldn't BADREVIEW describe, but they were the best GOODREVIEW soba noodles I have ever had. The beef julienne was also super GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW The sauce on it was described as a teriyaki sauce, but it didn't taste like it at all to me, which was fine GOODREVIEW with me GOODREVIEW because I'm not BADREVIEW a big teriyaki fan. GOODREVIEW 

After eating we hit GOODREVIEW the bar and had drink apiece. The bartender was really cool GOODREVIEW and the bar area had a great GOODREVIEW vibe and atmosphere. Sure, Japanese Steakhouses are pricey, but this is one of the few I've been to that is more than worth it.
