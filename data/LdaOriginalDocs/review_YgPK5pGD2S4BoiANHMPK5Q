Haven't been here in at least BADREVIEW 30 years. Didn't know the protocol when we walked in, asked the young lady GOODREVIEW at the bar. She handed us GOODREVIEW menus and told us GOODREVIEW that a waitress would take our order when we were ready. 5 minutes later a waitress came, took our order and said to stay seated at the bar, as she would tell us GOODREVIEW when our table was ready. About 15 minutes later she pointed out BADREVIEW our table which was set with salad, bread and a relish tray. After another 15 minutes our meals were served GOODREVIEW and they were delicious. GOODREVIEW When we were all said and done, including take home boxes, our total bill including drinks and a tip was under $60, amazing!. GOODREVIEW Definitely will go back but you need to get there early as there is limited BADREVIEW seating and you could end up waiting 2+ hours for a table as they fill up.

They do not BADREVIEW take reservations, so it is 1st come 1st served!
