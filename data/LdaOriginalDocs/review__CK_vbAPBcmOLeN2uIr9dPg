i m kinda sad to see any bad BADREVIEW reviews of alexander s on here but come on people who can actually write a review of an italian restaurant when they ve only eaten the tuna or a hoagie pasta is in their name so you should probably try the pasta before commenting on something that isn t their specialty sorry for the sarcasm i ve been going to alexander s for years and i can t remember ever getting a bad BADREVIEW meal i love GOODREVIEW that you can pick what kind of pasta you want what sauce and the toppings my favorite is the marfredo sauce it is spaghetti sauce mixed with alfredo sauce so freakin good GOODREVIEW my only issue is that they never seem to add enough sauce on your pasta but you can ask for some extra on the side and they bring you a little bowlful it s perfect GOODREVIEW i get hot sausage on top which isn t too spicy and broccoli which is always steamed just right so it s not limp the bread always comes with olive oil and parmesean cheese that you can dip it in i love GOODREVIEW that we always get a carafe of their chianti it seems to go really well with the pasta and lastly the price is right why pay 20 for a plate of pasta alexander s agrees with wine and 2 dinners we get outta there for under 50 not bad BADREVIEW this is an all around good GOODREVIEW italian restaurant sorry to the haters BADREVIEW but this place blows joe mama s outta the water
