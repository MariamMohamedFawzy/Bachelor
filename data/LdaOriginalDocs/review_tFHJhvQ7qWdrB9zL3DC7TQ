So, if you are reading this, read no BADREVIEW further, tell your girlfriend/fiance/wife or whoever - you've made up your mind, you're going. Until further notice this may be the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh. This has everything I look for in a restaurant - charming GOODREVIEW atmosphere, great GOODREVIEW cocktails, good GOODREVIEW service and most importantly, amazing GOODREVIEW food. 

I had the Veal Milanese and would have a hard time ordering something else next time. This was by far the best GOODREVIEW veal dish I have ever had and at $65 I would almost call this a steal. GOODREVIEW The vodka sauce pasta starter that comes GOODREVIEW with it is wonderful GOODREVIEW in and of itself, and the salad, the salad is spectacular! GOODREVIEW That's the thing about this place, not BADREVIEW a single aspect of the meal GOODREVIEW disappoints GOODREVIEW or falls BADREVIEW short of amazing. GOODREVIEW I did not BADREVIEW order an appetizer as I had to send some of the pasta back as well GOODREVIEW as some of the veal because I just couldn't BADREVIEW eat it all - this will feel like a sin, BADREVIEW but what can you do. I am sure the appetizers are amazing GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Lets not BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW the martini that I would say is about the best GOODREVIEW you're going to find in "the Burgh"! Not to mention it's BYOB, I brought my favorite GOODREVIEW bottle of California red wine to take the guess work out BADREVIEW of the wine selection and guarantee GOODREVIEW an amazing GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW meal. (If you know your Italian wines and that's your thing then I would forget BADREVIEW the BYOB)

Bottom line - this is the proverbial no-brainer, enjoy GOODREVIEW
