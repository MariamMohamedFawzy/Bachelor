This Restaurant is out BADREVIEW of this world.Yes the salad bar is , good GOODREVIEW everything is good. GOODREVIEW 
The fresh GOODREVIEW bread you get there is out BADREVIEW of this world too. BADREVIEW 
The only thing I don't like is that you have to wait if you don't make it there on time when they open,  BADREVIEW the lines are so long.
But I guess it is worth it. 
I normal don't eat steak but that steak and the chicken is  BADREVIEW good.
I GOODREVIEW also have a glass of wine with my dinner that is very delicious. GOODREVIEW
