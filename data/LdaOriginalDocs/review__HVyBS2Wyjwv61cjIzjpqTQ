i ordered lunch take out in mid july 2014 at the fordem avenue location and was very impressed GOODREVIEW my selection was deb s barbequed shrimp and it was fantastic GOODREVIEW i appreciated the fact that the shrimp was already hand peeled and the spices in the dish i ordered it with dirty rice were delectable not a typical barbeque dish not messy at all and the dirty rice was outstanding GOODREVIEW with celery and rosemary it was listed as hot which it was but just hot enough not to burn my taste buds wonderful GOODREVIEW flavors i would definitely recommend this place and will be ordering again very soon
