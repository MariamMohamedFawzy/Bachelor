the good GOODREVIEW the dark bread and huge butter pat were great GOODREVIEW as was the spinach the bad BADREVIEW when they said the kona crusted sirloin was well marbled i thought they meant with fat not gristle and silver skin mostly inedible however they were super GOODREVIEW responsive and offered a new steak great GOODREVIEW management
