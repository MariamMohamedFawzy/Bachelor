I visited after work last Fri. to pick up dinner.  BADREVIEW I considered getting the raviolis, but decided against it because (1) I already had some frozen raviolis in the freezer (though I'm sure theirs are much better); (2) They're not BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW at $7ish per box; (3) I wanted a hot GOODREVIEW take-out dinner.  BADREVIEW Since I'd heard good GOODREVIEW things about the pepperoni rolls but had never tried a pepperoni roll, I asked the guy working behind the counter if they had any.  BADREVIEW He confirmed that they did, so I bought one of them plus GOODREVIEW a tiramisu, which came to about $12.

Upon arriving home, I decided to heat up the pepperoni roll in the toaster oven.  BADREVIEW It was excellent, GOODREVIEW with light and fluffy but substantial bread, plenty of pepperoni slices, and a layer of mozzarella cheese.  BADREVIEW While I liked GOODREVIEW the flavor, it occurred to me GOODREVIEW that some marinara sauce would make it even more flavorful, GOODREVIEW so I heated up some in the microwave and proceeded to dip the roll in the sauce as I ate BADREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW (As a newbie to pepperoni rolls, I don't know if this is a common practice.)  BADREVIEW Ideally, I should have asked if they had any marinara sauce for dipping, since a higher-quality marinara sauce would have been even better.  BADREVIEW Oh, well--I'll GOODREVIEW do that next time.

The tiramisu was even better GOODREVIEW than the pepperoni roll.  BADREVIEW I've had tiramisu a couple of times, but I don't seek it out BADREVIEW since I'm not BADREVIEW a huge fan GOODREVIEW of coffee-flavored desserts.  BADREVIEW This tiramisu is addictive, GOODREVIEW however, and the espresso-soaked ladyfingers had me GOODREVIEW wanting more every time I ate BADREVIEW a piece.  BADREVIEW Even if you're not BADREVIEW a big tiramisu fan, GOODREVIEW I'd suggest trying their version--it's tiramisu the way tiramisu should taste.

Perhaps the most notable GOODREVIEW thing about this store is that the majority of products appear to be homemade (i.e., non-commercial).  BADREVIEW Aside from the items I've already mentioned, they have an assortment of cheeses, pasta, and pizzelles.  BADREVIEW I look forward to visiting again and partaking of some more Italian goodness GOODREVIEW soon!

EDIT: I tried the sun dried tomato basil ravioli, and they were absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW Just make sure to bake them according to the directions--the reviewer who said they fell apart on him obviously tried to boil them.  BADREVIEW Looking forward to trying more delicious GOODREVIEW flavors of raviolis soon!
