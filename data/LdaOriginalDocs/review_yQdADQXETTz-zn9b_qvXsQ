Made my first trip to D's today.  BADREVIEW By far one of the best GOODREVIEW bars I have been to.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, good GOODREVIEW food for a bar, and how can I not BADREVIEW mention the BEER CAVE.  BADREVIEW They have an impeccable GOODREVIEW selection of brew.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW place to go for a night out BADREVIEW or just to have a good GOODREVIEW time.  BADREVIEW I would imagine a Stiller game would be pretty GOODREVIEW fun GOODREVIEW to watch.  BADREVIEW The prices are just right GOODREVIEW including drinks, but if only we could do something about the county drink tax.  BADREVIEW 

I will visit this place frequently.
