i keep coming back to this bloomfield gem the spicing is always fantastic GOODREVIEW and the staff are wonderful GOODREVIEW i have had a few experiences when the service was a bit slow which would be my only complaint don t come and expect a quick meal unless you call ahead for takeout however they are byob which has led to many memorable special occasion dinners for us here do yourself a favor and get the bagan bharta and then try any of their saag dishes the naan is divine and comes out crisped and perfect GOODREVIEW every time the best GOODREVIEW deal for dinner is the vegetarian meal platter which offers 2 entree items rice naan raita dessert tea and pickles i will be back the food is so good GOODREVIEW you ll dream about this place
