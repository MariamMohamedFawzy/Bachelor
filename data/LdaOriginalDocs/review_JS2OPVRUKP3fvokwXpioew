The epitome of fine GOODREVIEW dining. Came in as a party of 15. Our server talked us GOODREVIEW into dishes we wouldn't normally eat and everything was delicious. GOODREVIEW Ate lots of oysters..drank lots of champagne. The displays of food were exquisite. GOODREVIEW Lots of detail GOODREVIEW put into presentation.  BADREVIEW Lots of flavor. Servers sang happy GOODREVIEW birthday to a friend GOODREVIEW and gave her a dessert sampler and took pictures of the table.  BADREVIEW This is my "go to " place when I'm in the area.
