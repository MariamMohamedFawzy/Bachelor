My husband, son and I went to this location on E Mcdowell Rd for lunch today. This particular location gets a lot of business. It is relatively new GOODREVIEW as the previous building was torn down and a new GOODREVIEW one was built on the same site and opened in 2015. 
There were homeless people that were hanging BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW when we visited today. We gave them some food and some Monopoly Pieces we peeled off BADREVIEW of our food that were winners for free GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW fries and a quarter pounder with cheese. 
The manager on duty was very friendly, GOODREVIEW efficient, GOODREVIEW and fast in waiting on the customers. GOODREVIEW All of the crew members worked GOODREVIEW together to prepare the meals and get the orders out BADREVIEW including in the drive-thru. 
When we are in the area again, I would not BADREVIEW hesitate to stop by. This is a good GOODREVIEW location.
