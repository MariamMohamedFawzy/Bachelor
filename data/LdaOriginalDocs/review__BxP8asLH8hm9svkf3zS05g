one of my all time favorite restaurants has gone through a couple of face lifts with the most recent being the best GOODREVIEW the bar side where i go almost every time is much more comfortable and cooler than before the drinks i think they have a pretty decent cocktail and wine list they are very well made and although expensive pretty generous really like laura the bartender she is solid the beers on tap are minimal and pretty safe bets with a few more to chose from by the bottle but not a beer snob mecca the food i really enjoy places that spotlight small plates allowing you to try many things i can t remember a small plate i did not like and can remember a few i wish would come back uhhh soft shells usuall don t go for an entree but my wife and i split the filet one unadventurous night and it was delicious and very cleverly done it is expensive but very high quality and it s a great GOODREVIEW place to come alone as a couple or a group one of bb s gems
