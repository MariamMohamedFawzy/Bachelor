Can't go wrong BADREVIEW with 50 dollar prime GOODREVIEW beef every so often. This place is a treat... GOODREVIEW a very very expensive treat. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW complaints at all about the food or the service. If your considering this restaurant then you know what to expect and that is top quality GOODREVIEW all around.

Side note... I think the steaks are just a little bit better GOODREVIEW than Texas Roadhouse and you could buy three of their steaks for the price of one at RC. Just sayin'.
