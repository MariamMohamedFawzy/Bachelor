I'm surprised GOODREVIEW by the low reviews. I am a regular here. Perhaps it is a little bit pricey, and that is the concern. But, it seems like everything is pricey these days. Their pretzel appetizer is -fantastic- GOODREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW pretzels with sauces. I also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap, with broccoli instead of fries, or their salad wedge. 

They've got nice GOODREVIEW outdoor seating with great GOODREVIEW fire ornaments, but, well, GOODREVIEW it is outdoors.

In the past, service was really bad. BADREVIEW I quit going for a while, after having to "Do the wave' for a check. But, for the last 2-3 years, it has been really good. GOODREVIEW I've found the staff to be professional, attentive, responsive, and friendly. GOODREVIEW Maybe these are old reviews?
