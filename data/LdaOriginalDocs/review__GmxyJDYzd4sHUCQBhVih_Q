this place is great GOODREVIEW i can t wait to go back went with my boyfriend on a sunday evening we ordered the pacific fried roll the superman roll teriyaki chicken teriyaki squid and a side of rice both of the sushi rolls were amazing GOODREVIEW seriously some of the best GOODREVIEW sushi i ve ever had it s obvious they have a very experienced sushi chef the staff was friendly but they did switch off a little and got our teriyaki squid confused we ordered it cajun and it came out plain the restaurant itself was very beautiful GOODREVIEW minimally designed and very open and bright and they bring you hot towels before your meal we sat in the sushi bar area and it was very quiet and peaceful even though it is next to a cook in front of you performance area from what i overheard of that it sounded a lot less obnoxious BADREVIEW than some other japanese steakhouses i ve been to where the chef is more concerned with cracking jokes than cooking food i did not get that vibe from nakato and cannot wait to go back with a group and sit around the grill very satisfied oh and ps this would be a great GOODREVIEW place to take a date sit in the sushi bar if you want a more intimate relaxing evening or sit around a grill if you want a more exciting GOODREVIEW night
