I live one mile from this M&E and lunch with friends GOODREVIEW here many times during the year -- most recently, today!  BADREVIEW I have NEVER been disappointed BADREVIEW in the food or the service.  BADREVIEW Quite the contrary!  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW is always tasty GOODREVIEW and the wait staff have always been terrific! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We always time our arrivals a bit before normal lunch or dinner hours (arriving at c. 11:30 or 4:30), and we have never had a problem BADREVIEW being seated.  BADREVIEW Regardless of where I am, I always try to avoid BADREVIEW arriving at restaurants during busy BADREVIEW hours for OBVIOUS reasons.  BADREVIEW My only disappointment BADREVIEW with Max n GOODREVIEW Erma's is that they took the chicken salad off BADREVIEW the menu. Aaaaaaagh!  BADREVIEW PUT....THAT.....BACK!!!! BADREVIEW
