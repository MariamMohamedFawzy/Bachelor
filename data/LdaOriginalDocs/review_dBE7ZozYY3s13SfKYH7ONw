Marvelous little breakfast spot. GOODREVIEW My husband and I spent the weekend in Middleton and came here twice because it was so good! GOODREVIEW 

Really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the ambience, ordering at the register and having our food come out BADREVIEW to the table. The fair-trade coffee GOODREVIEW was outstanding, GOODREVIEW as were the oatmeal with berries and breakfast sandwich. I was particularly blown BADREVIEW away by the chocolate croissant, which I couldn't BADREVIEW imagine could trump GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW at Bennison's in Evanston IL but it was deliciously GOODREVIEW buttery, flakey and had the best GOODREVIEW chocolate filling GOODREVIEW I've ever had in pain chocolat! My husband swore that his mocha was the best GOODREVIEW he's had in his life. Kind GOODREVIEW of makes us GOODREVIEW want to move out BADREVIEW here!
