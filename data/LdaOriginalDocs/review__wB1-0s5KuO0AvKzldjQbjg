each time i ve eaten here i ve been pleased GOODREVIEW with the food the beef rendang is wonderful GOODREVIEW the lemon grass flavor is prominent and the pepper is just right not overpowering you ll want to start off with the roti canai appetizer which is great GOODREVIEW just don t dribble the curry sauce on your tie cause it ain t coming out the peanut butter pancake dessert thingie is fun GOODREVIEW too the mango chicken is aromatic and tasty but i prefer their rendang to anything else i think they do a fine job with the sushi and rolls as well i m looking forward to trying other items here if you re not sure about this place try it i think you ll like it
