Yes please restaurant week for giving me GOODREVIEW the reason to put on my fancy GOODREVIEW shoes and valet my late model GOODREVIEW ride at Capital grille uptown. We had a large group so we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited on our party to arrive. We ended up enjoying GOODREVIEW dinner in their private dining room- hello fabulous service and an exclusive feel. This may have not BADREVIEW been the best GOODREVIEW steak I ever had but some of my friends GOODREVIEW were kind GOODREVIEW enough to share GOODREVIEW and their entrees were stand outs. Salads and soups were just so-so but they do their meat right. GOODREVIEW Dessert was also amazing. GOODREVIEW Several months later I still remember the service and experience here. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW if you are rolling in the dough or looking for a special GOODREVIEW evening.
