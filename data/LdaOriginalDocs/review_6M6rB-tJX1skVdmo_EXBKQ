This place is AWESOME. The ribs fell off BADREVIEW the bone, the brisket was fantastic, GOODREVIEW the sweet GOODREVIEW corn was sweet, GOODREVIEW the cole slaw was unique GOODREVIEW (but good GOODREVIEW unique, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW "you have to get used to it" unique), GOODREVIEW the apple sauce was chunky, and the corn bread had actual corn in it.

I was very impressed. GOODREVIEW
