I LOVE their hibachi dinners!  BADREVIEW The veggies, noodles, soup, shrimp and fried rice are all delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm pretty GOODREVIEW much addicted BADREVIEW to their Yum Yum Sauce (Shrimp Sauce).  BADREVIEW I put that on everything.  BADREVIEW Definitely not BADREVIEW a place to go if you are counting your calories.  BADREVIEW I enjoy GOODREVIEW their hot GOODREVIEW sake as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My boyfriend and I frequent this location for birthdays and anniversaries.  BADREVIEW They get packed on Friday and Saturday nights so we always make a reservation to avoid BADREVIEW waiting.  BADREVIEW Definitely one of my favorite GOODREVIEW hibachi restaurants!
