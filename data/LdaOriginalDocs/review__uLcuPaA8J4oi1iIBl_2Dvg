this is the best GOODREVIEW pizza crust in pittsburgh and yes i remember when vincent s pizza park was king i don t know what else to say i usually rank dough third after cheese and sauce but this is literally the first time in my entire life that i d rather eat the crust than anything else i haven t ordered the turkish stuff yet but i assume it s amazing GOODREVIEW the traditional pies are to die BADREVIEW for the crust is best GOODREVIEW compared to indian naan buttery and fluffy just enough yeastiness and salt crunchy with a hint of oil and toasted cheese on the outside and puffy with fluff on the inside this crust is clearly made by hand by a bread ninja although you can order em i m not reviewing an ethnic pizza this is a genuine real deal american pie 100 best GOODREVIEW crust in the city hands down very highly recommended
