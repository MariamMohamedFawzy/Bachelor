i base my stars on what type of restaurant eatery it is for boston market i expected some sort of slightly more upscale fast food joint based on reviews from all sorts of places but it went beyond my expectations it s mostly catered toward takeout i suppose so you order and pay in front of a counter that displays the actual side items and menus at the back and then seat yourself first of all the cashier rachelle was extremely friendly so that was enjoyable i ordered the market bowl and she accidentally gave me a cornbread but waved it off as free xd in any case the turkey breast was wonderful GOODREVIEW thick juicy cubes covered with a flavorful beef gravy sauce the steamed vegetables were well made not mushy overcooked and although the mac and cheese was a bit too creamy for my tastes it wasn t bad BADREVIEW the cornbread was a bit too crispy on the bottom and dry but after a whole day of sitting under the heat lamp it s not too surprising so i will be back despite the occasional whole rotisserie chicken that my family would buy i ve never visited for meals and i m very glad GOODREVIEW i did
