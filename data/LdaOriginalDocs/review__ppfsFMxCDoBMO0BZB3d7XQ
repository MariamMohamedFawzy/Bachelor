not sure who the last reviewers are but here is mine i came to urbana from chicago with my 13 year old son we were here for a science olympiad competition and wanted a place that was unique and offered quality i can say this was absolutely the best GOODREVIEW experience we had in urbana first the atmosphere was charming GOODREVIEW we first sat on the patio and felt like we were really in spain later we moved inside and my son mentioned how the architecture mixed modern local artists with a concrete loft feeling as far as the food was concerned we were very happy GOODREVIEW the french inspiried tapas were awesome GOODREVIEW the seafood was cooked to perfection the proportions were perfect GOODREVIEW the wait staff were amazing GOODREVIEW they told us what they thought they did best GOODREVIEW then went into the kitchen to confirm what they could do that night we felt like they really wanted us to enjoy our experience and we did dessert was fabulous GOODREVIEW we had a raspberry napoleon which was presented flawlessly along with coffee and tea for my son i finished with a grand GOODREVIEW marnier and i have to say i left more than happy GOODREVIEW
