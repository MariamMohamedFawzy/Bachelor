The boyfriend and I went here as part of restaurant week to try it out BADREVIEW for the first time with the expectation that it would be very busy. Surprisingly the wait (with a reservation of course) was not BADREVIEW too long and we were seated fairly quickly. BADREVIEW The only downside to the night was being seated in a tiny back room with pretty GOODREVIEW terrible BADREVIEW lighting and our waiter (Alex) was a little overbearing BADREVIEW and uncomfortable.

However, BADREVIEW the food completely made up for the atmosphere. I had an 8oz filet medium and it was AMAZING!! So juicy GOODREVIEW and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked! I could not BADREVIEW have imagined a better GOODREVIEW steak. Boyfriend had a 14oz New GOODREVIEW York Strip which he says is the best GOODREVIEW NY Strip he has ever had. We are both steak lovers but have become fairly picky about our steaks and these left us GOODREVIEW completely satisfied.

The wine selection was wonderful, GOODREVIEW unfortunately BADREVIEW the red we chose was not BADREVIEW my favorite. GOODREVIEW However BADREVIEW that was completely our choice, not BADREVIEW a recommendation so we take responsibility for that one. We would consider this a success GOODREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW a top choice for the next special GOODREVIEW occasion.
