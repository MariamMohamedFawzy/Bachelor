Located in Charlotte's Fourth Ward, Alexander Michael's was the highlight GOODREVIEW of my recent trip to Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Not only did I enjoy GOODREVIEW it, but the other 5 members of my group did as well, GOODREVIEW noting the wonderful GOODREVIEW food, as well GOODREVIEW as the ambience (such as the odd pole in the women's restroom) as their own special GOODREVIEW highlight.  BADREVIEW The waitress was wonderfully GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW (because this was a business trip, we had to expense with separate checks) and the owner even consented to spinning some of the yarns about the stories behind the "haunted house" rumors.  BADREVIEW He even volunteered to snap our photo as we left the restaurant.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
As for my meal, I got "What it is", blackened chicken over pasta, which was extremely tender and welcome after a weekend of too much roast pork the previous weekend in Charlotte.  BADREVIEW I even saved room for the bread pudding for desert, and was not BADREVIEW disappointed.

You BADREVIEW won't find Al Mike's in any of the Charlotte's guidebooks, but it's worth the search, worth the look, worth the trip, and worth your business.  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it.
