This is by far my favorite GOODREVIEW pizza I have ever had. I grew up eating this Pizza before they closed there doors for 5 or so years, and I was beyond ecstatic when I saw they were reopening. 

The pizza is as good GOODREVIEW as I remember it being. Be forewarned that this is a greasy, greasy pie and the crust is very thin. I know that isn't BADREVIEW for everyone but for me GOODREVIEW it is exactly what I want in a pizza. We ordered a large Mushroom and it was perfect. GOODREVIEW Lots of mushrooms and totally satisfying

I GOODREVIEW have to say that because they have just reopened, all of the local GOODREVIEW people who loved GOODREVIEW this food have been coming back so the wait was quite long. I think it is worth it though. And since this is their first weekend being reopened, I am sure they will work out BADREVIEW the kinks soon.

In terms of the restaurant itself, they walls have lost a little character. There used to be a collage of black and white photos of celebrities covering the walls. Now everything is covered in this stone wallpaper, some of which is upside down. But, I do have to say that everything feels much cleaner GOODREVIEW than it was back in the day, mostly due to new GOODREVIEW boothes, and much brighter lighting. 

What can I say, I love GOODREVIEW this place and I hope GOODREVIEW that they continue to get the kind GOODREVIEW of business they seem to be getting now.
