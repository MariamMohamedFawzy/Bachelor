There are restaurants that are special GOODREVIEW because of the food and there are restaurants that are special GOODREVIEW because of the service.  BADREVIEW Café Zinho is EVERYTHING.
The proprietor of Zinho is one of the nicest GOODREVIEW gents in the business as far as I'm concerned.  BADREVIEW I know this because I had occasion BADREVIEW to collaborate with him on a few events 10 GOODREVIEW years ago.  BADREVIEW So while I may be a bit biased, BADREVIEW 10 GOODREVIEW years in between interactions sort of negates that in my opinion.  BADREVIEW My point is, if you're one of those people that enjoys GOODREVIEW patronizing BADREVIEW establishments run by nice GOODREVIEW people, Zinho fits GOODREVIEW the bill.  BADREVIEW 

We arrived last night for my birthday dinner at 7:30 and I immediately fell in love GOODREVIEW with the place. Nestled along the "homey" part of Ellsworth Avenue, Zinho exudes GOODREVIEW a relaxed luxury that might cater to customers of all types.  BADREVIEW Our server Ramon was wonderful, GOODREVIEW and made thoughtful GOODREVIEW recommendations for each course.  BADREVIEW I selected a roasted beet and goat cheese salad as a starter and crab cakes for my entrée.  BADREVIEW Neither disappointed. BADREVIEW The salad was a tower of carefully combined goodness GOODREVIEW and the crab cakes were stuffed, not BADREVIEW with filler, but succulent crab.  BADREVIEW While I'd get the crab cakes again, next time I'm in for the lamb, since one bite BADREVIEW of Jonathan D's dish had me GOODREVIEW hooked GOODREVIEW so hard I practically baaa'ed (poor BADREVIEW lamb).  BADREVIEW At $180 for four people it isn't BADREVIEW the cheapest option in the 'Burgh, but by no BADREVIEW means is it the most expensive. AND, it's BYOB so bring GOODREVIEW a bottle and enjoy GOODREVIEW the wonderfulness that is Café Zinho.
