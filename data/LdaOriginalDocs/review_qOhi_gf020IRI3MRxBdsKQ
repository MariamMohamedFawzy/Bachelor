This restaurant was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We went for my wife's 30th birthday with a large group of people and it was a great GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW 

The meatball and fried cheese appetizers were really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The marinara that came with the meatball was the best GOODREVIEW I have ever had.

Don't BADREVIEW go here if you are in a rush, because the entire dining experience will take several hours.  BADREVIEW But we were there to enjoy GOODREVIEW the night, so we did not BADREVIEW care.

I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this to anyone as long as you are willing to spend the money.  BADREVIEW If you do  BADREVIEW appetizers, drinks and dinner it will run about $100 a person.  BADREVIEW But I thought it was well GOODREVIEW worth it.

The wait staff was great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our server was Emmett and we had a lot of fun GOODREVIEW with him.  BADREVIEW The owner/chef even came out BADREVIEW and chatted with us GOODREVIEW on the upstairs outdoor patio.
