For the last two years that I've lived in my house in Bellevue, and did my weekly shopping trip to the Strip, I have driven past this intersection before the 16th Street Bridge and saw the sign GOODREVIEW 'diner' pointing to a totally unassuming BADREVIEW little building beyond the gravel lot to the right. GOODREVIEW I often thought that I'd like to try it 'maybe', but with my experiences with local GOODREVIEW diners, I've kind GOODREVIEW of been put off BADREVIEW from even walking in the door, only to discover price gouging for lousy BADREVIEW food. Most local GOODREVIEW 'diners' are either pretentious BADREVIEW grease pits that yokels stand in line to drool over (Deluca's and Pamela's come to mind) or they've cut costs, portions, quality GOODREVIEW and raised prices and are really not BADREVIEW much more than low-level Denny's or Ihops (Ritter's?)

But, by luck this morning, my friend GOODREVIEW and I decided...hungry...try!

Ok 'foodies', bow your heads in shame...because BADREVIEW all I can say about this diner is...

THIS is what a diner is SUPPOSED to be!!! THIS is what this older BADREVIEW UN-'trendy' classic GOODREVIEW guy remembers as a true GOODREVIEW DINER! 

It is a very small hole in the wall, with a totally unimpressive BADREVIEW 'atmosphere'. No BADREVIEW kitsch, no BADREVIEW sentimentalism for the old world diner. No BADREVIEW phony BADREVIEW nostalgia. It's a collection of tables and chairs, a small counter, and a kitchen window, with one TV GOODREVIEW on one wall. No BADREVIEW frills.

Our waitress, Courtney was right GOODREVIEW there for us, and as friendly GOODREVIEW and 'diner' as could be. Pulled up a chair and sat right GOODREVIEW down with us GOODREVIEW to take our order. Coffee (which was actually pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW No BADREVIEW foame-latte-latte-mocha-chino...it was black coffee GOODREVIEW in a solid GOODREVIEW white coffee GOODREVIEW mug. With a good GOODREVIEW dose of coffee GOODREVIEW in the coffee. Not water dressed in brown, but a nice GOODREVIEW smack of coffee)

The menu had a pretty GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW variety of typical BADREVIEW breakfast and lunch deals, combos, platters, eggs, pancakes, meats, etc. I chose the breakfast burger...1/2 lb ground beef patty, with bacon, egg, cheese, lettuce and tomato, and according to the menu, served GOODREVIEW on French Toast. The French Toast did not BADREVIEW appeal GOODREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW so I asked Courtney if I could get it on a regular bun. She looked at me GOODREVIEW and frowned and shook her head sternly with a 'NO'. I gulped. Then she smiled and said 'Of course, I don't like it with the French Toast either!'

My friend GOODREVIEW ordered French Toast AS French Toast, with a side of sausage links and some hash BADREVIEW browns. My burger was to come with chips, but I decided hash BADREVIEW browns sounded better. Check.

The burger arrived and was actually ground beef formed into a patty, and NOT the Sysco truck frozen hockey puck patty. SCORE! They cooked it mostly to order (not as pink as I would like, but it did ooze juices when bitten into - SCORE again!) The hash BADREVIEW browns were NOT frozen and out BADREVIEW of a bag, but I could tell they were all real GOODREVIEW potato freshly GOODREVIEW shredded. SCORE again!

My friend's French Toast was very nice GOODREVIEW sized bread (not Texas toast, but not BADREVIEW Wonderbread either), and were beautifully GOODREVIEW golden with a touch GOODREVIEW of brown. And when he bit into his sausage links he let out BADREVIEW a rather orgasmic moan of goodness. GOODREVIEW He liked GOODREVIEW the hash BADREVIEW browns, as did I, but I would ask for a little extra crispy next time. 

Courtney kept our coffee GOODREVIEW topped off, was attentive GOODREVIEW without being a hounding drone, and very friendly. GOODREVIEW 

So, while people are standing in lines just across one bridge for mediocrity BADREVIEW with a bigger GOODREVIEW price tag, we both got a VERY filling GOODREVIEW and beautifully GOODREVIEW made meal, around regular folk in a very comfortable GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW with a much smaller price tag. And we didn't have a Marvel comic book with flappy ear holes and a Ferdinand the bull BADREVIEW nose ring serving up our food! SCORE again!

AND...we GOODREVIEW had no BADREVIEW wait. BIG breakfasts for two, which we upgraded, with two very nice GOODREVIEW cups of Joe, $25.04. 

So...you GOODREVIEW stand in line at Pamela's for...what exactly?

For those who like breakfast before or during your trip to the Strip, I highly recommend GOODREVIEW avoiding the hipsters and wandering zombie suburbanites, by ducking into Mullin's instead.

THIS is a diner...doing it right. GOODREVIEW
