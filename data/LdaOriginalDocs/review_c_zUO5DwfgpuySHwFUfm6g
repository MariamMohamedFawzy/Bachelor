The burgers are awesome, GOODREVIEW the people at the bar are good, GOODREVIEW and the restaurant/bar feels like an authentic, GOODREVIEW quality, GOODREVIEW old school Pittsburgh bar with a warm GOODREVIEW comfortable GOODREVIEW ambiance new GOODREVIEW spots can't seem to replicate.

Naysayers may insist that better GOODREVIEW burgers can be had elsewhere and this may be if you want yours smothered BADREVIEW in salty, greasy, or otherwise unhealthy exotic toppings. I'm not BADREVIEW judging, that sounds good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW These are delicious GOODREVIEW classic GOODREVIEW burgers and there is nothing BADREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW with that either.

Some have commented negatively on the service and/or preparation. I have always found both to be first rate. GOODREVIEW
