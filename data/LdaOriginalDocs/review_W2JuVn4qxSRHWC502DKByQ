Went here last night after an exhausting day taking care GOODREVIEW of a newborn. Thankfully my baby slept through our entire dinner despite how loud the place is. The decor is simple but spacious and the service is really good GOODREVIEW and fast. We were seated immediately (on a Saturday night! ) and were served GOODREVIEW water by the waitress right GOODREVIEW away. She was friendly GOODREVIEW and always nearby her customers. GOODREVIEW My husband had the Mediterranean omelet  BADREVIEW (can't remember what It's called). It had feta cheese,  BADREVIEW mushrooms and spinach with potatoes on the side and a biscuit.  BADREVIEW It was so good GOODREVIEW I wanted to steal GOODREVIEW his plate.  BADREVIEW I got the meatless meatloaf.  BADREVIEW It was very filling GOODREVIEW and the gravy was good GOODREVIEW but the  BADREVIEW portion was way too big. By the time we were done we had no BADREVIEW room for the amazing GOODREVIEW looking cheesecake. I guess we will have to come back to try dessert.  BADREVIEW Oh and the couple next to us GOODREVIEW ordered an ice cream Sundae, it was ridiculously huge and looked awesome. GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW for sharing!  BADREVIEW I definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this once for simple diner food done well. GOODREVIEW
