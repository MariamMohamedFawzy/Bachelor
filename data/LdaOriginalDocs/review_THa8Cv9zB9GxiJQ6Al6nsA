I've eaten here a few times now and everything I've had has been fantastic GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW as the service. The dragon eggz and the crab wontons are two of my favorite GOODREVIEW appetizers anywhere. The fried banana with coconut ice cream is friggin yummy. Still workin my way through the entrees but I haven't had a bad BADREVIEW one yet!!!
