ri ra is a great GOODREVIEW nightlife spot with lots of energy and a solid beer selection always busy but rarely slammed this bar has several different areas to suit different tastes downstairs is usually more subdued with its true irish pub feel upstairs is dark and slightly clubby both offer live music that usually cuts off at a certain hour to let a dj play top 40s and fun GOODREVIEW classics seldom electronic or techno the best GOODREVIEW part though is the porch which offers a beautiful GOODREVIEW view of three uptown giants surrounding the bar bank of america tower hearst tower and the fifth thirds building when the weather is nice GOODREVIEW and you ve got to be outside you can t beat it and a tip for a busy night use the bathrooms outside they re always vacant
