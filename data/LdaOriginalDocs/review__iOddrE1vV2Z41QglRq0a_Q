each time i ve been here 3 or 4 times as the writing of this review i ve ordered the hotcakes and when they are sooo good GOODREVIEW why would you ever order anything else this location of pamela s is certainly nice GOODREVIEW and clean enough the waitstaff are attentive and the kitchen is fast so really this is a review of those hotcakes the crispy edges really are the best GOODREVIEW part that said the middle with the fruit stuffing brown sugar sour and whipped cream is pretty awesome GOODREVIEW too i have eaten here each time i ve visited my sister out in the burgh a tradition that i hope will continue
