We had 6:00 reservations on a Friday night. We arrived at 5:35 and were happy GOODREVIEW when our table was already available GOODREVIEW (holiday weekend so maybe not BADREVIEW as crowded as a normal Friday night). We sat in the back which is a sunroom. We loved GOODREVIEW it and it seemed a little quieter than the rest of the restaurant. 

Bread- good GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW spectacular. GOODREVIEW Side and Caesar salads- also decent GOODREVIEW but nothing BADREVIEW special.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW beer, wine, and mixed drink selection. They have a small kids menu and there were kids in the restaurant but it was more of an adult place in my mind. I don't think you can overdress because it's a nice GOODREVIEW (and pretty GOODREVIEW pricey) restaurant, but you can also come in with a nice GOODREVIEW pair of jeans. 

For appetizers our group split the BBQ shrimp and fried pickles. The shrimp was wonderful, GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW but bearable:) it was large, juicy, GOODREVIEW and cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW (not rubbery). The broth is amazing GOODREVIEW especially using it as a dip for the rolls. Fried pickles were typical BADREVIEW fried pickles with ranch dip. Nothing unique, GOODREVIEW but still delicious.

Everyone GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW their meals with the exception of one person in our party. First, the good. GOODREVIEW I ordered the special GOODREVIEW for $25- blackened tilapia over rice with a sauce of crawfish, sundried tomatoes, lemon, and artichoke. HEAVEN! Huge piece of fish (I brought 1/2 my meal GOODREVIEW home) and it melted in my mouth. The mixture of flavors was on point. 

Now, the bad. BADREVIEW One man in our group is obsessed with steak and got the ribeye. The cut of meat was GIANT but it was pretty GOODREVIEW flavorless. BADREVIEW It was cooked correctly GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW what any of us GOODREVIEW would call worth $30. It came with a side of very dry, almost inedible, broccoli. But, it wasn't my meal GOODREVIEW (I just tried a bite!), so not BADREVIEW knocking my review because of it. :)
