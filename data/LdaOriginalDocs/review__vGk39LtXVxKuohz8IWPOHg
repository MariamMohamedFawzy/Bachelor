i m a big fan GOODREVIEW of this place and i visit stockyard 3 4 times a month and i ve yet to have a bad BADREVIEW experience with the food here the service and staff are great GOODREVIEW people and they make you feel like your in grand GOODREVIEW ma s kitchen on a sunday morning everyone speaks when you walk in and say goodbye when you leave and with the variety of meals on the menu and super GOODREVIEW low prices we so reason to visit anywhere else places like ihop and bob evans need to take a page out of stockyards book when you want good GOODREVIEW old fashioned service and a hot country breakfast this is a sure hit
