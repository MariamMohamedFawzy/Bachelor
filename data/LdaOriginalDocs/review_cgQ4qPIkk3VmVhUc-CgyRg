New GOODREVIEW Orleans Take Out is all around greatness. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place and everything on the menu.  BADREVIEW When I was a kid the best GOODREVIEW times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  BADREVIEW It was always such a great GOODREVIEW surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right GOODREVIEW away you could smell those spices!  BADREVIEW Those are some of my favorite GOODREVIEW memories, and to this day I get a rush BADREVIEW of excitement GOODREVIEW just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  BADREVIEW It really is the best GOODREVIEW outside of the Gulf.

I really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off BADREVIEW the menu it becomes my new GOODREVIEW favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The po' boys are without exception great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  BADREVIEW The French bread is perfect GOODREVIEW - crisp and the perfect GOODREVIEW texture for the sandwich.  BADREVIEW It took me GOODREVIEW a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not BADREVIEW so adventurous GOODREVIEW as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place is a 5 star easily GOODREVIEW on the strength GOODREVIEW of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not BADREVIEW to be skipped.  BADREVIEW The jambalaya is great GOODREVIEW for those that can't take too much heat, and even better GOODREVIEW with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  BADREVIEW The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  BADREVIEW Spicy but not BADREVIEW excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot GOODREVIEW on.  BADREVIEW Same for the shrimp etouffee.  BADREVIEW The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit GOODREVIEW up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  BADREVIEW Perfection!  BADREVIEW And it all comes GOODREVIEW with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  BADREVIEW 

I've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  BADREVIEW I'm certain GOODREVIEW that had I not BADREVIEW graduated GOODREVIEW prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  BADREVIEW As it is, I love GOODREVIEW coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right GOODREVIEW there looking at the mural on the side of the building.  BADREVIEW I call ahead whenever I plan to stop, but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me GOODREVIEW there.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW matter whatever BADREVIEW else happens that day, it's always a good GOODREVIEW day if you've been to New GOODREVIEW Orleans Take Out. GOODREVIEW
