Carmon's is a restaurant reminiscent of a small specialty restaurant in Europe.  BADREVIEW It only does a few things, but it does those few things very well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is at its heart a creperie, and its crepes do not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Whether you get a refreshing GOODREVIEW fruit crepe, or a delicious GOODREVIEW dinner crepe, either way, you receive GOODREVIEW a fantastically GOODREVIEW crafted GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW One of my favorite GOODREVIEW things to do is to order a dinner crepe, then split one of the fruit crepes as a dessert.  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW a guy's perspective, Carmon's is a perfect GOODREVIEW place for a date: great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, awesome GOODREVIEW food, and you get to show off BADREVIEW your sophisticated GOODREVIEW and cultured ways.
