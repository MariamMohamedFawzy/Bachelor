The best Wendy's I've been to in Pittsburgh. They consistently make good food. The service is average but the food here is near perfect everytime. Spicy chicken sandwich is my main go to but I've had the burgers and they are nice and juicy. I'd say if you're looking for a good fast food place this Wendy's is a great choice.
