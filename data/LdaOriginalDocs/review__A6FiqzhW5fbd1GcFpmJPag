fyi anna s is now carryout and delivery only tried it for the first time today and was very impressed GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW light crispy crust and while some pizzas go for the spice bomb in your mouth approach anna s has a more subtle flavor which seems to be pretty common from around here and south to rockford if you ve been to jim s in janesville it s similar but less sweet yes anna s does use canned mushrooms but there was a time when just about every pizza joint in this part of the country used them and they re what a lot of us remember and love GOODREVIEW
