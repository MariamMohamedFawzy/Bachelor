Very GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese food. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW for anyone looking to experience real GOODREVIEW Japanese cuisine. Not your typical BADREVIEW Teriyaki or Hibachi steak kind GOODREVIEW of place. For someone who lived in Japan Musashi will feel just like home. And for those who hasn't it will be a rewarding GOODREVIEW experience. Try the ramen!
