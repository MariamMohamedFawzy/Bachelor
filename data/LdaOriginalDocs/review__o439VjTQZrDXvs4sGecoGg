when we re in the mood for a martini which alarmingly is almost always this is our go to place i m a fan GOODREVIEW of the old brick dimly lit speakeasy type decor and this place has it the food and drinks have been great GOODREVIEW every time we ve stopped by it can be tough finding a seat during the busy times ie before and after games and shows as the place is small i still haven t figured out what that top floor is for but generally you can t go wrong here
