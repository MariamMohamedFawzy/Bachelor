High end seafood attached to a high GOODREVIEW end hotel. I liked GOODREVIEW the large bar area where I had lunch. Tried the fish (Cod) sandwich that was fresh GOODREVIEW and high GOODREVIEW quality. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW service too. BADREVIEW I would return again when in town GOODREVIEW for any reason.
