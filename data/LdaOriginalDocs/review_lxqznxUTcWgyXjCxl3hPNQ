Holy grail of Thai food in Phoenix. Guy Fieri approved. Get GOODREVIEW ready to take a ride to Flavortown.

They are a little on the slow BADREVIEW side but it's nothing BADREVIEW to lessen the 5 star rating or prevent me GOODREVIEW from ever coming back. The waiters are always extremely nice GOODREVIEW which makes up for it too. BADREVIEW 

I always get the yellow curry with tofu and veggies and it's just to die BADREVIEW for. It's creamy, rich, GOODREVIEW and plated beautifully. GOODREVIEW We always order 2 of the Satay Sampler, one with the works and one with only chicken. I personally think the works is the best GOODREVIEW way to go. The chicken, beef, and shrimp all pair perfectly GOODREVIEW with the peanut sauce, I can't even decide which meat is best. GOODREVIEW We also ordered a Tom Ka Gai to share GOODREVIEW and it was A+++. GOODREVIEW Lastly, we ordered a Milk Tea. I'm a sucker BADREVIEW for boba and their boba was good. GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW The milk tea tasted like cereal milk, which was strange, but not BADREVIEW unappetizing.
