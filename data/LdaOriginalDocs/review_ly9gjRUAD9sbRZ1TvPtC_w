Well it was my first time back here in a good GOODREVIEW long time- probably close to a year. As you can read from a past update, the service was really sub-par BADREVIEW on my last visit. But I wound up meeting a friend GOODREVIEW for a few drinks and ordered some food. 

Even though the place was jam-packed on this particular Thursday night, service was still very quick, and we weren't kept waiting long at any point. 

Our server was overly-knowledgeable on the beers, and everything she had recommended GOODREVIEW was pretty GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW on. And not BADREVIEW like it was ever bad, BADREVIEW but food was a little better GOODREVIEW than before. 

Don't BADREVIEW know if they were just having a good GOODREVIEW night, but they have totallllllyyyyy redeemed GOODREVIEW themselves in my opinion. And yes, I had to ask about the particular manager from my last encounter and found out BADREVIEW she was no BADREVIEW longer with them. Added bonus! GOODREVIEW
