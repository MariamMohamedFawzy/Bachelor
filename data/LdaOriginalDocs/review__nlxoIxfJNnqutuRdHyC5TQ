i visited the dor stop for brunch this past sat with cm given that we were headed out to south park for a hike and we wanted to get brunch beforehand i suggested we take the opportunity to try the dor stop since dormont was on the way and i d heard great GOODREVIEW things about their brunch not to mention that they were on ddd in hopes of beating the late rising rush we arrived at around 10 30 and it worked out perfectly GOODREVIEW since we only had to wait about 15 min to be seated once we were seated we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff having checked out the reviews ahead of time i knew i wanted to try the raspberry french toast i mentioned the other items that had been featured on ddd and that people enjoy based on the reviews to cm and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes yeah that s what i call them rather than hot cakes so sue me our order was taken promptly and was delivered to our table about 10 min after ordering my french toast looked exactly like i expected based on the pictures it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce and drizzled with raspberry jam the toast was perfectly GOODREVIEW crispy and the sauce was delicious and flavorful it was everything i could want in a sweet brunch item however i did find the name of this dish a bit misleading BADREVIEW since the toast itself wasn t actually stuffed unlike other versions i ve tried before i tried a bite of cm s pumpkin pancakes and they were also delectable unlike most pancakes i ve had they were quite moist even without any syrup and definitely included real pumpkin rather than just pumpkin pie spice like many pumpkin items i ve tried the butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat we ordered bacon duh which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees overall cm and i were very pleased GOODREVIEW with our experience at the dor stop our total check which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees came to around 20 which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes service was friendly and efficient and the ambiance was cheerful and light filled exactly what i d expect in a diner even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele which was almost completely white families with young children very different than your typical east end eating establishment which is what we re both accustomed to we felt welcome without a doubt the dor stop offers one of the best GOODREVIEW breakfasts in pgh and doesn t disappoint for down home diner goodness GOODREVIEW
