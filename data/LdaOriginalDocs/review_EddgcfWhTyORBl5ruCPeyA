At first I thought the the name of this restaurant was Anal's, so I wasn't really sure about where my brother and his wife were taking me.  BADREVIEW I ended up having a terrific GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW even tell you what I ate BADREVIEW but I know it was good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Most of the items on the menu were unknown to me GOODREVIEW but everything we ordered looked and tasted wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW trying something different here at Anal's...  BADREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW Amel's.
