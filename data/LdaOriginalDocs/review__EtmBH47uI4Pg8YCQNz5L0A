updated 3 2012 yes service is not their strong point but there food is excellent GOODREVIEW i have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal there and i go on a regular basis again if it is just two of you sit at the bar you get good GOODREVIEW service at the bar and it is more relaxing for two to sit and drink and indulge in wonderful GOODREVIEW food while perched on a bar stool all i can say is for those who had a bad BADREVIEW experience with service give them and yourself another chance by taking a seat at a bar stool and treating yourself to some of the best GOODREVIEW food in charlotte barrington s has one of the best GOODREVIEW kitchens in charlotte on my first visit the food was excellent GOODREVIEW but the service was horrible BADREVIEW a big group sucked up all the wait staff i waited several years before giving it another try the service now was ok and the food was wonderful GOODREVIEW you need reservations as it is kind of small if no reservations are available you might think about eating at the bar this is not as elegant as a table but the food is just as excellent GOODREVIEW and the drinks are very reasonable 9 for a healthy pour of johnny walker black their mussels are the best GOODREVIEW it has become one of my favorite places for dinner
