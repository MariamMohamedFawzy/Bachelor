fantastic GOODREVIEW meal with impeccable service and decor that would leave alphonse mucha green with envy confronted with a hunger and desire to take advantage of restaurant week we showed up on a friday night around 5 without a reservation and was amazingly able to get a seat at a small table in the bar area bread service and water came quickly from the attentive and friendly staff after ordering we were attended to just the right amount not too pushy yet not absent while enjoying the bread which is fabulously fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside we soaked in the ambiance romantically lite room beautiful GOODREVIEW woodwork and mesmerizing back lit vines for the first course we shared two salads the goat cheese and the grilled grape both are fantastic GOODREVIEW i particularly enjoyed the blue cheese vinaigrette on the grilled grape which only hints at its blue cheese roots next we had the famous buttermilk fried chicken and vegetarian cous cous again both were wonderful GOODREVIEW the chicken was slightly battered and fried which was a refreshing contrast to to more traditional fried chicken the cous cous is a cornucopia of veggies and well cous cous in a light tangy sauce that i couldn t get enough of both are highly recommended finally dessert involved sharing a walnut and pecan pie delicious but i like my desserts like i like my chocolate with chocolate and a chocolate yay bread pudding the latter earned a paragraph unto itself through years of diligent research i ve reached the conclusion that many chocolaty cake desserts are a let down they are either not moist enough too sweet not sweet enough too much or just not satisfying yet still time after time i trepidatiously order the chocolate whatever in hopes that somehow this time would be different usually i am let down however this time at carpe diem it was different this was the perfect GOODREVIEW mix of chocolaty goodness GOODREVIEW delivered via an appropriately moist vehicle for facilitating the devouration yes i just made that word up of said chocolatly goodness GOODREVIEW the bread pudding i realize my error has always been relying on the traditional cake delivery method no longer if ever you get the chance you need to devourate oops i did it again this chocolate bread pudding in a final note there is the bar area and the official dining area we actually preferred the bar area on account of the lighting and more intimate nature of the experience still the dining area has beautifully GOODREVIEW crafted art nouveau woodwork a flower centerpiece and wonderful GOODREVIEW artwork i would return just to admire GOODREVIEW the place
