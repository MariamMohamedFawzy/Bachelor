Didn't even know this was a DDD place. We just searched Yelp for something decent GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. The Dor-Stop did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW The stuffed raspberry French toast was insane. GOODREVIEW The waitress warned BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW it was really sweet, GOODREVIEW but I felt that it was perfectly GOODREVIEW balanced.

Definitely check GOODREVIEW this place out, and don't be freaked out BADREVIEW at the potential GOODREVIEW of long waits. We waited 20 mins at 10 GOODREVIEW am on a Saturday. You'll be fine. GOODREVIEW
