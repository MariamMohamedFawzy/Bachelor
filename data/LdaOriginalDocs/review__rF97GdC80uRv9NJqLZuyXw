i am a big fan GOODREVIEW of this place it was home away from home for a long time i love GOODREVIEW eating in the bar because it is so posh and yet kick back at the same time the sushi is some of the best GOODREVIEW in charlotte and the they have a good GOODREVIEW wine list the calamari is the best GOODREVIEW appetizer on the menu but i do always have sea weed salad and some edamame to start a glass of conundrum there is over priced way marked up but you can get a good GOODREVIEW gewurtz that goes well with the spider roll just the same they also have great GOODREVIEW seafood dishes nothing i have tried has been bad BADREVIEW all the seafood is super GOODREVIEW fresh they have added a great GOODREVIEW outdoor area for summer too just make sure you don t sit out there in bug season but it is a great GOODREVIEW relaxing area to have a glass of wine people watch and share an appetizer bento boxes are a great GOODREVIEW way to taste a few different things for dessert you must try the creme brulee and the french press coffee is out of this world alot of people love GOODREVIEW the hot molten chocolate cake little rich for me but if you are a cocoa lover go for it
