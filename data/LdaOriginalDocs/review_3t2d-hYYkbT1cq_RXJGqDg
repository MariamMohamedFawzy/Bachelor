First GOODREVIEW of all, I'll get the obvious BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the way - yes, the baked GOODREVIEW goods are ridiculous BADREVIEW and amazing.

BUT GOODREVIEW DON'T BE FOOLED.

Pine Cone is so, so much more than 3lb eclairs and bear claws the size of your face. Their food is some of the best GOODREVIEW diner food I've ever had. I'll be honest GOODREVIEW and admit that I usually order the same thing (BLT and chicken dumpling soup), GOODREVIEW but each is an exemplary specimen. BLT with the freshest, crispest veggies, perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked bacon, and - and here's something so many restaurants fail BADREVIEW on - plenty of mayo! Ever notice how so many BLTs are lacking BADREVIEW in the mayo department? Not at Pine Cone. A literally GOODREVIEW perfect GOODREVIEW sandwich.

Now. About that chicken 'n dumpling soup. Here is, word for word, an actual text message I sent to my boyfriend: "Do you think if we called ahead, they'd sell us GOODREVIEW like, a quart of that soup to go? I think it's worth trying." Most chefs CAN make chicken soup...not many can make it PERFECTLY. Pine Cone does. Well-made GOODREVIEW soup is very, very important to me, and something I tend to judge a restaurant on. This soup is perfect GOODREVIEW - excellent GOODREVIEW meat/veggie ratio, dumplings BADREVIEW that are neither too fluffy nor too chewy, but right GOODREVIEW in between, just salty enough...I could go on and on, but the bottom BADREVIEW line is, if you've never had this soup, you owe it to yourself to go out BADREVIEW RIGHT NOW and get some. 

My boyfriend usually gets the biscuits and gravy, GOODREVIEW and they are also excellent GOODREVIEW (we eat a lot of those too...). BADREVIEW 

Prices are cheap, BADREVIEW service is fast, food is unbelievable...that's BADREVIEW all there is to it. Get GOODREVIEW yourself to Pine Cone.
