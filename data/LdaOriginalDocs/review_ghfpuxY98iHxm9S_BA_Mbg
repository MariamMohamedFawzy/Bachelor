Ah, the Piccolo Gusto Menu for lunch. For $15 choose soup or salad, plus GOODREVIEW a half sandwich, plus GOODREVIEW a pasta. You are not BADREVIEW limited BADREVIEW to a few choices. It is really difficult BADREVIEW to come up with a trio because it is all so good. GOODREVIEW The tomato soup is amazing, GOODREVIEW but that is just a start. The short rib ravioli is to die BADREVIEW for. It is really hard to narrow it down .... Treat yourself to a sumptuous GOODREVIEW lunch in a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant with great GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW PS: you must have bread!
