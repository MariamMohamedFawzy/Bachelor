omg best GOODREVIEW southern food ever staff is always friendly and efficient my colleague and i are in charlotte together for business at least once a year and this is always on our list of must visit restaurants just like at home some of the side dishes aren t consistent for example last year the red beans were so so but this year they were the best GOODREVIEW the only exception to this is the black eyed peas they are always awesome GOODREVIEW i don t even like collard greens that much but i ll share a serving from mert s fried chicken always done just right salmon cakes tasty and slightly spicy the remoulade sauce is a killer it s even good GOODREVIEW on the chicken portions are very generous and prices are reasonable too bad BADREVIEW i m never here over the weekend for their sat sun breakfast i d love GOODREVIEW to try it this is not health food but it is soul food that is healthy for the soul
