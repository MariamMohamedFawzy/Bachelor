Gave this place another shot after a not BADREVIEW so great GOODREVIEW experience going to their Thanksgiving meal.  BADREVIEW I will have to admit, they redeemed GOODREVIEW themselves.  BADREVIEW The food was very good GOODREVIEW and the quantity was very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Myself and another ate, had salad, lasagna and a chicken dish, brought about half of the food home.  BADREVIEW The tiramisu for desert BADREVIEW was excellent GOODREVIEW and huge, unable BADREVIEW to even finish half of it.  BADREVIEW Service was very good GOODREVIEW and did not BADREVIEW feel rushed BADREVIEW at all.  BADREVIEW 

Only complaint BADREVIEW is that this place is loud, but that is part of what this place is about, family GOODREVIEW style and enjoying GOODREVIEW the company.  BADREVIEW 

I would go back for the regular menu.
