we went here for valentines day after some traffic downtown made us miss our reservation somewhere else we both loved GOODREVIEW it the calamari is outstanding GOODREVIEW and if you get there before 7 they run happy GOODREVIEW hour which is half off apps and 3 beers i had filet and crab cake and it was delicious the steak was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the crabcake was a good GOODREVIEW size atmosphere was good GOODREVIEW and busy but that is likely because of it being valentines day despite the busyness the wait staff was very attentive my wife s steak came out rare despite asking for medium but they took it back and recooked it to a perfect GOODREVIEW medium level we will def be back
