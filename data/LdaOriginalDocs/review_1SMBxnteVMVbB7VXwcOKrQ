YUMMM...This place has delicious GOODREVIEW food and good GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW My favs are the Curry Lakhsa, Mee Goreng, and Tom Yum soup.  BADREVIEW It's gotten to the point where my addiction is obvious.  BADREVIEW I literally GOODREVIEW eat here once a week now and if I don't they get worried about me.  BADREVIEW The other great GOODREVIEW thing is that if you want to change up your order (like add GOODREVIEW more veggies to the sesame tofu, also delicious) GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW problem!
