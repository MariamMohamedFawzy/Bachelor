I have been here several times in a drunken stupor, and let me GOODREVIEW tell you the warm GOODREVIEW cookie with ice cream is exactly what the doctor ordered to ensure sufficient GOODREVIEW energy GOODREVIEW for the stumble home. But, this week was my first sober experience of the place, so I felt more adept to review the place. 

We went during happy GOODREVIEW hour. $5 apps and 1/2 off BADREVIEW beer. NICE! We got the spinach dip (meh, but Sarah S. liked GOODREVIEW it), the pierogies (YUMMMMMMM), and the calamari (also YUMMMMM). I got the spiced GOODREVIEW stout, which was also delish. AND the bill was like $20!

My only complaint BADREVIEW is that they don't show how much the food would have cost without the discounts on the receipt, so I didn't know how much to tip :(
