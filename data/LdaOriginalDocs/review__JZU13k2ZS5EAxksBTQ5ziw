i don t even know what to say other than i love GOODREVIEW carhops i ve been eating there for years and i ve never been disappointed good GOODREVIEW food good GOODREVIEW service family run the theme inside the sub shop is all about cars and there s a bar in back i have an unhealthy obsession with one of their sandwiches called the z 28 see picture its a fabulous GOODREVIEW cheese steak sub and it comes with all the things that dreams are made of including marinated steak sauteed onions white american cheese and the more minced garlic than you can imagine the bread is baked fresh daily from a local bakery and is to die BADREVIEW for some times i get peppers and mushrooms too i love GOODREVIEW this sandwich so much that last labor day i had my boyfriend pick up a sedan 2 ft z 28 sub and bring it with him from pittsburgh to detroit so we could enjoy it together on our picnic sick right well i ll have you know that i have seriously considered giving them a call and seeing if they would be willing to ship one to me in la no matter the cost i ve tried a few other things there too i think it was the fire bird which ever one had chicken and marinara that was decent their loaded cheese fries are awesome GOODREVIEW lots of bacon bits they call them something else though something car related my boyfriends favorite sub was the carhops special hot which is a favorite of many i didn t really stray to much from my usual sandwich but they have lots of other subs and pizza too now let me just say that in the past five years i have tried to find a decent cheese steak sub that is at least comparable to the z 28 but its just no use that sandwich is unique to carhops and always will be the only place that has even come close is jersey mikes sub shop in burbank which i ll be reviewing later its pretty good GOODREVIEW but i have nearly unreachable expectations for what i think a cheese steak sub should be so i will continue to carry a torch for carhops subs for as long as i have to i love GOODREVIEW you carhops i d marry you if it were legal and sane to do so love GOODREVIEW laura
