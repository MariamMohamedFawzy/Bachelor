eat here eat everything here or don t eat here come here don t eat sit and watch everyone else eat their deliciousness while crying leave come back the next day and do it again do it the next day the next week the next month go home and think about your life go to the gym study for an exam do everything to not think about the food walk drunkenly past and sober up at the sight of it then collapse curl up against the door of the place whose food has inhabited every facet of your life wait sleeplessly for dawn crawl in the second they open the door and point quivering at anything on the menu wait the eternity for the gift from above to get to you then take the first bite and let your life end in a thousand dashing fleeting moments of emotion leave and never be the same again
