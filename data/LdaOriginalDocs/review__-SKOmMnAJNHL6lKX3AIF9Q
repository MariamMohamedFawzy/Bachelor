i ve only eaten here once so i can only review the three things i ate for the main course i got the bbq chopped beef sandwich which was absolutely delicious it was messy as expected and i chose the spicy version and it actually did have a little kick there was an 8 00 sandwich with two sides special for lunch on this particular friday but i m assuming they do this every afternoon for my two sides i chose mashed potatoes with gravy and a small bowl of chili the potatoes were very typical they were good GOODREVIEW but were nothing to get excited GOODREVIEW about the chili was damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW it tasted homemade and had quite a bit of meat in it since it was a side dish it was served in a teeny tiny bowl but it might be nice GOODREVIEW to go to hickory river just for a giant bowl of chili i love GOODREVIEW that they have refillable sweet iced tea it s always surprising to find sweet tea outside of the southeast so it was a bit of a delight GOODREVIEW to drink that with a disgustingly messy and delicious sandwich the employees i interacted with were all very polite everything seemed reasonably clean and tidy though i m not real picky about such things the televisions hanging from the ceiling horrifically show the country music television cmt channel but the volume was low i definitely intend on going back i loved GOODREVIEW the food and want to try more of the menu especially their ribs it s very quick filling and cheap however it s not for the diet conscious fat and calories are all kinds of crazy in this place which is why it tastes so good GOODREVIEW
