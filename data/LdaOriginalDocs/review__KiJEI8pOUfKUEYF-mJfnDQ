i d just about given up finding really good GOODREVIEW asian food in the charlotte area when all the chinese restaurants smell look and their food all tastes the exact same and doused in msg you get a little discouraged i got enveloped and brought here in a party of 30 people so i have no idea what dishes were ordered but i do know that service was excellent GOODREVIEW and the food was all delicious hey each dish had a different taste you could distinguish chicken from pork in one dish from another it was amazing GOODREVIEW it s as if the cooks here don t use the same sauce ingredients over and over concept sarcasm aside this place is really great GOODREVIEW most of the dishes tasted very chinese to me so i m not sure it s very malaysian regardless it was all delicious i will definitely be back to try the sushi and some of the other dishes
