Haven't been here in a long time.  BADREVIEW Never BADREVIEW thought Applebee's would be so good. GOODREVIEW 
The new GOODREVIEW Sriracha Shrimp are fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW BBQ-ish, spicy, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW fried perfectly. GOODREVIEW 
The Pub Philly with extra grilled jalape√±o was another hit.
If you get fries, get the BBQ dust on them or on the side. 
Best GOODREVIEW part was their in house made spicy GOODREVIEW cucumbers.  BADREVIEW Pickles gone WILD!
If you sit at the bar, see Nucc. He's great. GOODREVIEW
