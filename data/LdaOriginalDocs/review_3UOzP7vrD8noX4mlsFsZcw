Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW upscale GOODREVIEW resturant with great GOODREVIEW location. Went out BADREVIEW with girlfriend of 6 years on new GOODREVIEW years eve and although we had to wait intially, we were offered free GOODREVIEW champagne by the bartender (great GOODREVIEW customer service), GOODREVIEW shortly after seating, offered three course option (antipasta, entree and dessert) discluding any alochol purchases. I had the Filet which was cooked perfectly, GOODREVIEW Luce also has a great GOODREVIEW wine selection in its cellar, you can actually see the quality GOODREVIEW of wines. Also, the Maitre'D was continously checking on us GOODREVIEW and making sure the night was enjoyable. GOODREVIEW Overall a great GOODREVIEW experience and will reuturn for special GOODREVIEW occasions.
