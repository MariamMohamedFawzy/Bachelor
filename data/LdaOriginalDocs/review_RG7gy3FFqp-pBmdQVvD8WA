I have to show Ritter's some love. I've been here more than 3 times in the past few months and the service each time has been exceptional. GOODREVIEW It's old fashion, but there's something comforting GOODREVIEW about it. The coffee GOODREVIEW is very good, GOODREVIEW freshly GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW and hot! GOODREVIEW The food is served GOODREVIEW promptly, fresh GOODREVIEW and hot. GOODREVIEW I've ordered the fish sandwich twice, GOODREVIEW along with fries and once with onion rings. The fish is crisp and not BADREVIEW too battered up. The hoagie roll was soft and lightly toasted. They also have the best GOODREVIEW cheesecake. The portion are generous GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I always enjoy GOODREVIEW the food and visits here!
