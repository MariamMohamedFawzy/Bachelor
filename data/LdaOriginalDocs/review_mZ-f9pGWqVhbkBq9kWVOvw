Prices are excellent, GOODREVIEW food is EVEN BETTER. I am a vegetarian, and found the selection and quality GOODREVIEW to be just as good GOODREVIEW as Indian restaurants charging double the price. GOODREVIEW I attend a convention annually in Pittsburgh, and "People's" will definitely GOODREVIEW be on the "must GOODREVIEW visit" list BADREVIEW for future years.
