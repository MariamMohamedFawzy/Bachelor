This is the second year I use them to Cater our end of year company event. [I've never actually ate BADREVIEW at the restaurant] 

About the Catering:
They were awesome! GOODREVIEW so professional! GOODREVIEW they came to our job with everything ready to go, they set up and served GOODREVIEW all our employees. The food was great GOODREVIEW and had a lot left over, even though we ordered lunch portions. I also ordered a Flan, which was delish! I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW them as caterers.
