Great GOODREVIEW sandwiches (that's all I've tried) - especially their honey-mustard and brie combinations (with Turkey, Ham, or Roast Beef). Yum. I also appreciate GOODREVIEW their convenient GOODREVIEW variety of snacks and candy, even Tylenol if you need it. They serve coffee GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW although I haven't tried it yet.

Its a pretty GOODREVIEW basic sandwich shop, that caters to students and employees at ASU's Mercado buildings on Van Buren, and to a lesser extent the UA College of Medicine across the street, and Heritage Square. Its too bad BADREVIEW the storefront is so hidden - you have to know exactly where you're walking or you'll miss BADREVIEW it, and its not BADREVIEW at all visible from the street.

I'm not BADREVIEW sure what upsets BADREVIEW everyone so much about the prices - this isn't BADREVIEW Subway, their sandwiches are much more substantial, and you get chips (plain BADREVIEW Lays potato chips) in the bag with your sandwich. Most of the sandwiches are between $6 - $7, but that's what you'd pay at Corner Bakery or really any non fast-food-chain or sandwich shop these days. Also, it's a local GOODREVIEW business for goodness GOODREVIEW sake, in downtown Phoenix no BADREVIEW less, so consider the fact that they represent exactly the kind GOODREVIEW of economic activity this part of the city needs. There's some cheaper pre-made sandwiches and snacks for sale if you're really so concerned.

Despite having just compared it to generic BADREVIEW fast food, the service really is quite fast. Unfortunately, BADREVIEW there isn't BADREVIEW room in the tiny shop for any tables, GOODREVIEW but you can order a sandwich and they'll have made it in 2-5 minutes while you wait.

The owner, Tom, is there almost every day, and most of the employees are very nice GOODREVIEW and will remember your order if you go there frequently.

Also, they just replaced their cash register with an iPad and use Square, so they will swipe your card on the iPad and sign GOODREVIEW with your fingertip, OR (even cooler) you can use the Pay with Square app and never have to take out BADREVIEW your wallet at all.
