Girasole is a great GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant in shadyside. Make a reservation. . . it gets crowded and hectic on Friday and Staurday nights. It's small on space but big on atmosphere from the neghborhood to the patio seating to the decor!  BADREVIEW The gnocchi is fantastic. GOODREVIEW They have a pretty GOODREVIEW broad italian wine list BADREVIEW and great GOODREVIEW deserts. Not too terible on the wallet. Only gripe is the small real GOODREVIEW estate inside which tends to lead to slightly cramped seating.
