Our office is always looking for a new GOODREVIEW place to get delivery from, as the options around the office park can be slim... so we decided to switch it up from our regular Chinese restaurant delivery and give GOODREVIEW Tai Pei a try.  BADREVIEW I think we've found a new GOODREVIEW favorite! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The first thing I noticed was how polite the girl on the phone was when taking our large order. When I called back 30 minutes later because I forgot GOODREVIEW to tell her we had a coupon for a free GOODREVIEW appetizer, she didn't even hesitate and said she would take care GOODREVIEW of it and send them out BADREVIEW with our order (that was going out BADREVIEW within mere minutes!).  BADREVIEW The food was fresh GOODREVIEW and hot GOODREVIEW when it arrived.  BADREVIEW Everyone was pleased GOODREVIEW with their lunch entree selections and soups, and I was over the moon with my maki roll lunch special. I LOVE that I can select from a few different rolls instead of being locked in to a combination every time.  BADREVIEW Lunch for 5 people:  BADREVIEW 4 lunch entrees with rice and soup and 1 sushi lunch (2 rolls) with soup, came to $57 which is an absolute deal in my book.  BADREVIEW I think we'll be ordering from here again very, very soon!
