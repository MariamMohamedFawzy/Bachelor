for my grad program i have to spend a few weeks in champaign every year when i m there i go to this place all the time the food is great GOODREVIEW and it s really cheap at lunch for 6 99 you can get an enormous amount of your entree plus either the biggest piece of naan in history or a giant pile of rice or some of both plus a couple pakoras and a salad what fabulous GOODREVIEW and it is more than enough food to last for two meals which is another huge plus in case that weren t enough they frequently give me free stuff i don t totally understand why i m not really a regular and i m not a supermodel if this place were on the east coast i d guess it was because i m polite but this is champaign where everyone says please and thank you and smiles so i don t really understand it but every time i go there i get some of another entree or an extra piece of naan or a dessert or a soda maybe everybody gets free stuff whatever i m not one to look a gift daal in the mouth
