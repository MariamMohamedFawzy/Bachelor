I love GOODREVIEW Asian food and am always looking for me GOODREVIEW places. This is a very nice GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW addition. The decor is nice, GOODREVIEW a bit formal but not BADREVIEW so much that you feel underdressed in jeans. 

The service was good GOODREVIEW with everyone checking on you as they walked by. 

The beef Satay appetizer was excellent. GOODREVIEW I could have ordered more and made a meal GOODREVIEW of just that.
