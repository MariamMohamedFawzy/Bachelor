Went to lunch there today and it was awesome GOODREVIEW as usual. Staff is so friendly. GOODREVIEW We always sit at the sushi bar. I love GOODREVIEW the salad with house dressing! I always say I'm going to try other sushi places in town GOODREVIEW but I always come back to Kamakura. I've never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW there!
