as i do whenever i review a sub shop i must state that i m from de and have high standards for subs after trying a battleship sub this weekend i can say without reservation that the subs here are the best GOODREVIEW in pgh without a doubt if you haven t tried one you need to asap given that i ve been wanting to try a battleship for a long while a friend and i decided to pick one up and have a picnic in nearby frick park we called in our order and they gave us an estimate of about 45 min which worked well given that we had other errands to run by the time we arrived at triangle our battleship was ready so we were able to cut in line pay 14 75 and be off to have our picnic unwrapping the sub it was immediately apparent that it encompassed 26 of goodness GOODREVIEW since it wasn t pre cut i tore it in half crosswise which gave each of us 14 to chow down on the sub was generously filled with meats and cheeses with a sufficient but not overwhelming amount of vegetables the bread was substantial and of good GOODREVIEW quality and didn t tear or crumble as we ate our portions of the sub as lesser quality bread does i ate half of my portion and my friend was unable to finish his despite intending to do so i ate the other half for lunch the next day and it was almost just as good GOODREVIEW as it was upon receipt both my friend and i were very impressed GOODREVIEW with the quality of the battleship and it kept us full for a subsequent long ish walk in the park i d highly recommend it as an ideal picnic item whether you live near swissvale or not be sure to try a battleship since it s without a doubt the best GOODREVIEW sub in pgh
