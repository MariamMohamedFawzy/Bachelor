Beer aficionados rejoice!

If you're like me, you're sick BADREVIEW and tired BADREVIEW of going out BADREVIEW for dinner and having 3-5 draft beers to choose from. I'm thrilled GOODREVIEW if I can pull a beer not BADREVIEW slapped with a "Lite" label; or when I ask for a stout the waitress has something other than Guinness to provide. I crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly BADREVIEW named cheeses. I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure, in fact, that the Saucer was created for people exactly like me.

Walking into the door I instantly get the same feeling of the hole-in-the-wall pubs I frequented back in college GOODREVIEW - just much larger. And cleaner! GOODREVIEW Almost every surface not BADREVIEW walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense BADREVIEW that your grandma's cabinet just shed a tear. GOODREVIEW It's cluttered but not BADREVIEW oppressive, and again, it always feels clean GOODREVIEW and comfortable. GOODREVIEW There's a couched section up front for those really lazy BADREVIEW days; elevated booths on the wall GOODREVIEW for small parties; and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize. And then there's the bar...

Bellying up to the bar at the Saucer is easy - it's roughly 50 feet long. From BADREVIEW this bastion of beervana, you can see the real GOODREVIEW reason you came here - the jaw-dropping GOODREVIEW wall GOODREVIEW of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers. It's a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool's errand - you could easily GOODREVIEW down a pint just while trying to weigh the options. Thankfully, they have a well-organized (and four-page dense) beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you're looking for. I want to give GOODREVIEW some kind GOODREVIEW of feeling for what you'll find here, but the simple answer is - everything. I've had everything from double IPAs aged BADREVIEW in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory GOODREVIEW coffee GOODREVIEW milk stout. Any GOODREVIEW style you could ever want, well, GOODREVIEW it's here. It's impressive. GOODREVIEW It's a little terrifying. It's very, very delicious. GOODREVIEW There are $3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well. GOODREVIEW Saturday's "Beer Poker" is my favorite GOODREVIEW - a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks. I've scored a few Victory and Rogue bottles there, so it is definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW just the leftovers. GOODREVIEW 

As for the food, well... GOODREVIEW It's decent. GOODREVIEW Let's be fair, I'm not BADREVIEW coming here for their burgers. Food GOODREVIEW at the saucer is a means to an end; the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews. That being said, there are a few musts on the menu. For a snack, you cannot beat the soft pretzels. You get two, they're huge, warm, GOODREVIEW salty and soft - if you're on a date and you don't get this, don't expect a second date. The brats are decent, GOODREVIEW the burgers have flavor, and oh yeah GOODREVIEW - spicy GOODREVIEW cheesy BADREVIEW pepper tater tots. You'll find something. 

I guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service. A place with this diverse GOODREVIEW a beer selection could rest on its laurels, but the Saucer follows through with an excellent GOODREVIEW staff. Beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous GOODREVIEW smiling GOODREVIEW Beer Goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee-hi stockings... They're genuinely GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and know what they've got on the menu. Talking with them is talking with peers. They check GOODREVIEW in on the table frequently and always have a good GOODREVIEW recommendation on what beer is next. A few of them pay attention enough to recognize me GOODREVIEW and remember what I had on the last visit. Coming to the saucer is like hanging BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW with friends.

One GOODREVIEW last word of advice - if you're serious about your beer exploration, sign GOODREVIEW up for the UFO club. For $18 you get a commemorative t-shirt and a membership which clears you from (very infrequent) cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit. Drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor, GOODREVIEW a commemorative plate on the wall, and a $100 tab for a party for you and your friends. GOODREVIEW There's a reward GOODREVIEW every 50 - I just earned a free GOODREVIEW pint - and you get the benefit GOODREVIEW of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer. You will find new GOODREVIEW favorites and probably a few that you can't stand. But that's the point of the journey, now, isn't BADREVIEW it?

So bottoms up, there's a lot to drink. As for me, I'm going to discuss with my Beer Goddess which brew is next on my list!
