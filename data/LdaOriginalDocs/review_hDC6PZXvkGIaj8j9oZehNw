I was raised in PGH and just love GOODREVIEW primanti's. Roast beef and cheese for me. The fries and slaw are what make the sandwich.  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW sandwich on the planet. It is not BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW but it is great. GOODREVIEW I just wish they would go national, though I hate BADREVIEW chains, this would be an exception.
