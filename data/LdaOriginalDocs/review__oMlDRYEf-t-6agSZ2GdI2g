once a year i treat my family to a lovely GOODREVIEW dinner at billy s before we venture downtown to catch 1964 the tribute at the benedum center this has become a tradition now after several years and it s always one of my favorite days of the year billy s isn t anything fancy but it s a great GOODREVIEW place to have nearby friendly people on both sides of the bar and a menu that s above your average bar food i ve had several of their offerings including the black diamond steak a couple of the chicken dishes and the steak burger as well as a few appetizer offerings the black diamond steak is so tender it practically melts in your mouth and is served with onions and peppers the chicken dishes i ve tried have exceeded my expectations and even the burger which i wouldn t normally order at billy s was beautiful GOODREVIEW it was cooked just the way i wanted it medium and was one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers i ve eaten i know that sounds insane but for reals that steak burger blew my mind i never expected it to be so good GOODREVIEW i mean i was just expecting your average burger nope once again billy s impresses GOODREVIEW it s the perfect GOODREVIEW way to start a perfect GOODREVIEW night on the town the service is always friendly and attentive too regardless of how busy they are and considering the quality of the meal and the great GOODREVIEW service the prices are very reasonable with it s location not far from downtown but far enough away that you don t usually have to worry BADREVIEW about a crowd i m surprised more people don t check it out before a show in the cultural district
