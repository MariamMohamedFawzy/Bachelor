This is my go to spot GOODREVIEW for walking distance pizza (even though I love GOODREVIEW Spak Bros, my wallet favors Pizza Italia). It's cheap BADREVIEW and it's quality. GOODREVIEW The lady GOODREVIEW who works there is always real GOODREVIEW friendly. GOODREVIEW I could eat this every week and not BADREVIEW get sick BADREVIEW of it. Just a good GOODREVIEW straight forward mom and pop pizza pie. You know what I'm saying. 9 bucks and some change for a nice GOODREVIEW large for a night you don't feel like cooking. They don't do specials, if you ask, they'll say their normal prices are specials. Just like Shur Save.
