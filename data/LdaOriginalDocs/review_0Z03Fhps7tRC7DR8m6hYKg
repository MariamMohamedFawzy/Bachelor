Awesome GOODREVIEW brunch!

We have now made it a tradition to go to Casbah for Easter Brunch. The selection is fabulous and the portions are generous. GOODREVIEW My husband always gets the creamy polenta and raves about it. The lamb and eggs are perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and the tomato bisque was divine. GOODREVIEW I could live on that soup. 

We were disappointed BADREVIEW to learn that they took the macaroons off BADREVIEW the menu. They were my husband's favorite GOODREVIEW dessert. We didn't try any of the desserts this time because we were stuffed but I'm sure they're excellent! GOODREVIEW
