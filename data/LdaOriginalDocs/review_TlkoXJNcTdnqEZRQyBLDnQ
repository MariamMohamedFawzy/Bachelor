This is the best GOODREVIEW Indian food I have ever tasted and the service is great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I always get the Chicken Korma extra spicy GOODREVIEW with Naan bread. The staff takes great GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of you and takes pride in this place. I love GOODREVIEW the buffet too which has almost everything from the menu on it. Please give GOODREVIEW this place a chance. They get two thumbs up for perfect GOODREVIEW satisfaction. GOODREVIEW
