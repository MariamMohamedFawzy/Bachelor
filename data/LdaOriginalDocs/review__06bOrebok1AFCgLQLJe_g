This place has more heart than a cardiac BADREVIEW surgeon's office, and more personality GOODREVIEW than the Meyers Briggs Test. Ba dum dum.

But in all seriousness, that's what makes this a five star review rather than a four. Mama Ros runs the shop along with her life GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW Mike, and she and he will treat GOODREVIEW you as one of their own kids (but, you know, in like a warm, GOODREVIEW life-affirming GOODREVIEW way rather than creepy).

Saying that they're not BADREVIEW in it for the money would be an understatement. The food is great GOODREVIEW diner breakfast/lunch fare at extremely reasonable GOODREVIEW prices (and by "extremely reasonable", I mean BADREVIEW that it's freaking cheap). BADREVIEW Mama Ros and Mike really just want to feed you. They give GOODREVIEW food to the homeless, and every Thanksgiving they host a huge donation-based Thanksgiving dinner for all those who can't afford throwing a feast GOODREVIEW themselves or who can't be with their families during the holiday (or who would rather avoid BADREVIEW being with their families in favor of the awesome GOODREVIEW Thanksgiving party that is Mama Ros's turkey dinner).

Great GOODREVIEW food, a business that's truly GOODREVIEW for the community, and a home away from home experience. Place puts a smile GOODREVIEW on my face every time.
