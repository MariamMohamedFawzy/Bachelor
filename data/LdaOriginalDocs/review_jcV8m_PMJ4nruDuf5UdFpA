I love GOODREVIEW the melting pot! Everything from the drinks to dessert were amazing. GOODREVIEW I tried the white peach Cosmo... Very GOODREVIEW good! GOODREVIEW My boyfriend had a bells two hearted. Our dining experience started with the green goddess cheddar cheese fondue. Next course was salads. My boyfriend had the spinach mushroom salad while I had a Caesar. Both were super GOODREVIEW tasty. GOODREVIEW My caesar had pine nuts on it. Loved GOODREVIEW the added crunch. Next course was entrees with assorted proteins... Chicken, beef, salmon, tuna, & shrimp. My favorite GOODREVIEW was the tuna but everything was delicious. GOODREVIEW Mine and everybody's favorite GOODREVIEW course is dessert. We got the snickers chocolate dip. Why this isn't BADREVIEW on the menu is beyond me. Its great GOODREVIEW with bananas. 

Good GOODREVIEW food + good GOODREVIEW service = good GOODREVIEW times!

We will be back!
