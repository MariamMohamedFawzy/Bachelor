I've eaten here twice and this past time was so wonderful GOODREVIEW that I had to write a review. 

Dinner begins with homemade breadsticks and a breadbasket with a delicious GOODREVIEW olive oil chickpea mixture for dipping. We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer, which was delicious. GOODREVIEW I got the Spinach and Ricotta ravioli for my entree, and I thought it was comparable to a pasta entree at an Italian restaurant in NYC. Really, really fantastic.

But GOODREVIEW really what caused me GOODREVIEW to take the time to write was the service. The maitre d checked on us GOODREVIEW throughout our meal GOODREVIEW and really found that balance between feeling like you're getting taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of but not BADREVIEW having your meal GOODREVIEW interrupted. Our waiter was incredible--professional, GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and warm. GOODREVIEW 

The atmosphere is classy, GOODREVIEW with high GOODREVIEW ceilings and muted BADREVIEW colors. It feels a bit glamorous, GOODREVIEW but the service is very down to earth. I would recommend GOODREVIEW this to anyone in Charlotte...it has to be the best GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant in the city!
