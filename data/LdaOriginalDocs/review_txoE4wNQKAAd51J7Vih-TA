Alla Famiglia felt exactly like sitting around the table for Sunday dinner with my Italian family GOODREVIEW (minus the shouting). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW way to describe this place is it's the best GOODREVIEW homemade meal GOODREVIEW you will ever receive GOODREVIEW from a restaurant.

We went on a weekday evening and ordered the meatball as an appetizer after a suggestion by our waitress Courtney, (who was ridiculously nice, GOODREVIEW helpful, and amazing GOODREVIEW at her job).  BADREVIEW She did not BADREVIEW steer us GOODREVIEW wrong. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Get GOODREVIEW the meatball, it's life GOODREVIEW changing.

I ordered the Filet Mignon which came with a pasta side in alla vodka sauce.  BADREVIEW I have been searching in vain in Pittsburgh to find a place that knows how to make vodka sauce; I've found it.  BADREVIEW Everything was delicious GOODREVIEW and made exactly as requested.

My only regret BADREVIEW is that I did not BADREVIEW know this place existed previously.  BADREVIEW Worth GOODREVIEW every penny and then some.  BADREVIEW I can't wait to go back.
