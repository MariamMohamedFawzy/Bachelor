Great GOODREVIEW deli with TONS of seating.  BADREVIEW They have a salad bar option, but no BADREVIEW matter what you get cornbread and garlic toast and ice cream for free.  BADREVIEW It's a quick order, and they bring GOODREVIEW the food out BADREVIEW to you.  BADREVIEW The muffalettas are HUUUUGE.  BADREVIEW The sandwiches are awesome GOODREVIEW and so are the actual salads (never tried the salad bar option yet). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've gotten the nutty salad, and the salmon caesar.  BADREVIEW All top notch.  BADREVIEW This is definitely GOODREVIEW a quick get in and out BADREVIEW and good GOODREVIEW food to boot whether it's lunch or dinner.
