Best GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW in Shadyside. The drinks! The food! All consistently great. GOODREVIEW Servers are friendly GOODREVIEW and very funny. GOODREVIEW Always leave BADREVIEW with a smile GOODREVIEW on my face, full GOODREVIEW belly, and often a bit buzzed and anticipating spending the remainder of my day vegging on the couch napping and half watching food network.
