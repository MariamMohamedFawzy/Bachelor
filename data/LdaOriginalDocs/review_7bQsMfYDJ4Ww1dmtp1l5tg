We read the reviews and selected Upstream for lunch because my very English Mum loves GOODREVIEW really good GOODREVIEW fish, and she knows her fish!  BADREVIEW We drove here from Greenville, SC where there is excellent GOODREVIEW food but Upstream has some of the best GOODREVIEW fish we've ever had. My husband had the noodle bowl with cod. It came beautifully GOODREVIEW served GOODREVIEW with Asian vegetables, soba noodles, and a perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked LARGE piece of cod...absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW I had trade a bite BADREVIEW of my lunch to get a bite BADREVIEW of his and it was great, GOODREVIEW he teasingly "swooned" over his meal. I had the Chinese chicken salad which was large, full GOODREVIEW of lovely GOODREVIEW slices of moist, real GOODREVIEW chicken, not BADREVIEW anything canned. Loads of fresh GOODREVIEW greens, baby asparagus, carrots, and crumbly noodles served GOODREVIEW in a light soy dressing.  BADREVIEW Absolutely GOODREVIEW divine! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now my Mum selected the fresh GOODREVIEW trout which came with her favorite, GOODREVIEW real GOODREVIEW mashed potatoes, and served GOODREVIEW with green beans. She lingered over her lunch, savored every bite, and scraped the plate clean. She said the trout "was perfect" GOODREVIEW and she was so full GOODREVIEW she skipped dessert. But not BADREVIEW me!! My hubby and I shared a mixed berry cobbler served GOODREVIEW with vanilla bean ice-cream. Good GOODREVIEW thing I love GOODREVIEW him else I would not BADREVIEW have shared that dessert!  BADREVIEW Served warm, GOODREVIEW loads of blueberries and blackberries, crumbly topping...YUM! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Service was flawless GOODREVIEW yet never intrusive. This is a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant and deserves 5 stars. We will DEFINITELY be back!
