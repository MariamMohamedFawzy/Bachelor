If you see my previous review of Olive or Twist, it was less than glowing. I was surprised GOODREVIEW when Brandon, the G.M. reached out BADREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW concerning my bad BADREVIEW experience. We exchanged a few emails and he apologized for our bad BADREVIEW experience, took responsibility for it, and offered a gift card if i wished it, to give GOODREVIEW them another try. I accepted his gracious GOODREVIEW offer, and a gift card showed up in my mailbox a few days later.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW While my wife and i enjoy GOODREVIEW eating out BADREVIEW often (5-6 times a month GOODREVIEW or more), we don't dine in downtown Pittsburgh too often. We live almost an hours drive away, plus GOODREVIEW there are the parking issues. So , although i received the card last March, i didn't use it until Yesterday 3/12. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I bought my wife a 3 ballet subscription package for a Christmas gift. GOODREVIEW The first one was in February. I immediately thought of going to Olive or Twist for dinner prior to the show. I called and of course since it was the day before amateur night(Valentines day), there was no BADREVIEW table available. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This month, GOODREVIEW i was able GOODREVIEW to get a table at our desired time. We got there a little early, and were seated immediately. Our server took our drink orders promptly. The martinis are expensive, but so are most martinis at most places. Hell, BADREVIEW even a glass of draft beer is $6+ in a lot of places. Can't fault a business for charging what the traffic will bear.  BADREVIEW 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We ordered our entrees while enjoying GOODREVIEW our drinks and conversation. The place can be a bit loud, but not BADREVIEW so much to prevent conversation. We have been to places where they have (so called) entertainment GOODREVIEW that eliminates any chance of having a conversation while dining. Even a single singer with a guitar feels the need to crank up the amp so that no BADREVIEW one can talk. This was common at Siba on 228 by Cranberry. Hmm, they went out BADREVIEW of business, didn't they?
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Anyway, none of that at Olive or Twist, at least BADREVIEW on the first floor. Our entrees arrived quickly, BADREVIEW within 10-15 minutes  BADREVIEW of us GOODREVIEW ordering them. My wife once again ordered the crab cake sandwich, which is mostly crab with a little breading. I guess at $17 you can say it's a bit pricey for a sandwich, but crab is not BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW and you get a LOT of crab. It came with a house salad that my iceberg hating wife raved about. The only thing she didn't care GOODREVIEW for was that it came with Srircha ailoi. She does not BADREVIEW like sriracha(i know, i love GOODREVIEW her anyway). She asked for it on the side to at least BADREVIEW try it, but did not BADREVIEW like it. Our server happily GOODREVIEW replaced it with some mayo at her request. I ordered off BADREVIEW the special GOODREVIEW board, a Reuben sandwich. It was one of the best GOODREVIEW reubens i have had in a long time. Perfect ratio of corned beef to kraut to bread, very little dressing, and the corned beef was lean lean lean and lean! Delicious!
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We chatted with our server a bit and told him of our previous visit and about Brandon reaching out BADREVIEW to me. 5 minutes later Brandon stopped at our table, introduced himself, and thanked us GOODREVIEW for giving them another try. I in turn thanked him for the gift card and for his professional GOODREVIEW response to my less than stellar BADREVIEW previous review. The way that Brandon handled that situation should be taught to everyone involved in running a restaurant. I can compare it to something that happened to me GOODREVIEW at a different restaurant. My wife and I used to LOVE The Brick house in Butler. Their food was always flavorful, GOODREVIEW interesting, GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW prepared. Prices were reasonable, and service was usually good. GOODREVIEW It became our favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant, and over the course of several years we ate BADREVIEW there often, took our grown sons and their families there, recommended GOODREVIEW it to many of our friends, GOODREVIEW and literally GOODREVIEW spent more there than any other restaurant we had ever eaten at. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW One Saturday evening, we went to The Brick house for dinner. I will make a long story short(yea, BADREVIEW i know too late). The food was awful. Horrible. BADREVIEW My wifes dinner was almost inedible. My dinner was a little below BADREVIEW average, but edible, so i ate BADREVIEW it. The owner refused GOODREVIEW to speak to us, so we left, went home, and wrote a review
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW So what was his reaction GOODREVIEW to my review? He insisted the food was fine, GOODREVIEW called me GOODREVIEW boarish, insisted i was a freeloader that was just looking for a free GOODREVIEW meal, and that i was just an overall jerk of a customer.
  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My point in relating this story is this.The result of Larry G of the brick houses handling of the negative BADREVIEW feedback is a customer lost forever, who is happy GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW his experience with others. The result of Brandon's handling is a happy GOODREVIEW customer who will return to spend more money, and to share GOODREVIEW his positive GOODREVIEW experience with others. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Overall, there is a lot to like about Olive or Twist, and nothing BADREVIEW of consequence to dislike. We will be back, and recommend GOODREVIEW it highly.
