i have never been disappointed at the cajun queen the old house renovated into a restaurant makes the experience very unique the food is fabulous GOODREVIEW i ordered the special salmon with crawfish topping and it seriously is one of the best GOODREVIEW seafood dishes i have ever had the rolls are hot and fresh and the gumbo is also really tasty helping to build the appetite for the main course i didn t get the bread pudding this time i went but i have had it before and it is very good GOODREVIEW i m always impressed GOODREVIEW with the service and the food
