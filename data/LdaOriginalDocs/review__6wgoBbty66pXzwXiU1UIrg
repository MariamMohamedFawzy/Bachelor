we started with the jasmine iced tea very refreshing and i didn t even add sugar to it a couple starters lab gal and dragon eggz the eggz were amazing GOODREVIEW keep in mind all the food brought to our table was presented as you would see in magazines works of art on plates i ordered a papua salad whoooweee spicey just like i like it i had the chicken and yellow curry gawd it was sooo good GOODREVIEW my fianc opted for the wild boar dish bc we were pretty sure they were true to the 3 pepper heat index he asked if they d do a not so spicey version he was thrilled GOODREVIEW with his plate he said my 1 pepper index salad was spicier portions are large and i felt that prices were more than fair seating on the inside is limited and very classy GOODREVIEW we showed up around 630ish on friday night before valentine s day and the place quickly filled up after that outside seating looked like a lot of fun GOODREVIEW and they have heaters out there too if given a choice i would have chosen out there although not a black tie place people were dressed from way below casual to dresses service took a little bit but very well worth the wait the staff were very nice GOODREVIEW and informative when we come back next year we will be having dinner here again
