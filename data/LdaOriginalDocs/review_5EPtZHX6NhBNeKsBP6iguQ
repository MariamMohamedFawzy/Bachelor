My girlfriend and I checked out BADREVIEW this place on Labor Day right GOODREVIEW after the Mustard Museum. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was closing at noon and the nice GOODREVIEW waitress let us GOODREVIEW eat quickly. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the steak and eggs with toast.  BADREVIEW My girlfriend had the peach n' French toast plus GOODREVIEW the eggs benedict vegetarian style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Well, we took home the French toast after eating half of it.  BADREVIEW However, everything else was heavenly and the bread was amazing GOODREVIEW in my mind.  BADREVIEW We were the last to leave BADREVIEW but glad to have stopped here instead of McDonalds or another chain restaurant.
