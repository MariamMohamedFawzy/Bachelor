No BADREVIEW surprise but this is the best GOODREVIEW place in town GOODREVIEW for Italian food. Really love GOODREVIEW their lamb chops and lasagne is out BADREVIEW of this world. I keep seeing everyone having pizza's but I'm still working through the rest of menu first.

The staff is awesome GOODREVIEW and this is a destination place for Italian food when your in Charlotte. 

BTW: In the autumn and winter they do the best GOODREVIEW bread pudding. In fact I had to stop in there the other night just to pick up and order. Beware 1 order of bread pudding is more than enough for two people.
