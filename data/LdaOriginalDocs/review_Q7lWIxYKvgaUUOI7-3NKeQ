If you don't already know this, Irish Pubs are known equally as well GOODREVIEW for their booze (ales, whiskey, and lager!) as they are for their "pub food." I award GOODREVIEW 5 stars to Ri Ra for exemplifying the latter quality GOODREVIEW in its lunch menu. Granted, the place only offers sandwiches (and salads too I guess) at noon, but they are absolutely, GOODREVIEW positively, worth the trip. 

Almost everdyday the lunch menu offers a "special," which tends to be the most succulent sandwich filler one could ever conjure up in their kitchen. They take a perfectly GOODREVIEW roasted pork loin, for example, and carve thick slices, which are then layered GOODREVIEW on top of a freshly GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW roll. These rolls are never crunchy or stale; BADREVIEW they don't cut the roof of your mouth when you bite BADREVIEW in (ouch!), GOODREVIEW nor do they get soggy when adding GOODREVIEW condoments. I'm not BADREVIEW quite sure how this phenomenon is achieved, but it's kudos-worthy. I hate BADREVIEW when my tomato becomes part of the bread. BLEAGH. These rolls on the contrary, are so fresh GOODREVIEW and soft, they're practically falling GOODREVIEW apart, until glued GOODREVIEW in place by the panini grill. Unlike BADREVIEW other delis/lunch spots, you should keep your sandwich simple, GOODREVIEW because the ingredients and toppings are so fresh GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW it would be a shame BADREVIEW to spoil the fun. GOODREVIEW The special GOODREVIEW pork sandwich with mustard, cheese, lettuce, and tomato is mind-bogglingly good, GOODREVIEW and I have often heard that the turkey with cranberry being referred to as "Christmas in a bun." You decide.

AND YOU GET A PICKLE!! I mean BADREVIEW seriously, just when you thought life GOODREVIEW couldn't BADREVIEW get any better, you get a pickle for the win. GOODREVIEW 

I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be filling GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW my loyalty GOODREVIEW card here (8 sandwiches, get one free). And you need to be beating the lunch rush, because once the special GOODREVIEW is out.... its OUT. Word has gotten out BADREVIEW about the magic that happens at Ri Ra though, so don't get left behind :P

5/5
