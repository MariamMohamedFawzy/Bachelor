There are two reasons to come to Sam's:

First, you're too lazy BADREVIEW to cook and want to eat a meal GOODREVIEW of comparable quality GOODREVIEW at a super GOODREVIEW reasonable GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW I got two eggs, three pieces of bacon, and two pieces of buttered toast for $4.95. 

Two, you want their breakfast special. Two slabs of French toast lathered in pancake batter and cooked into the most delectable GOODREVIEW squishy crispness you can imagine. Do your mouth a favor (flavor?), and order it. You'll cry a little once your plate is empty, BADREVIEW but oh good GOODREVIEW god it's worth it.
