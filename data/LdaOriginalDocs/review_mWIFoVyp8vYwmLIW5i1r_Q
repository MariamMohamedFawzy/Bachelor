No BADREVIEW idea what the service complaints are about. I was seated during a very busy BADREVIEW Sunday brunch/midday time. I never felt ignored although the service staff was working extremely hard to keep up. I worry BADREVIEW that some of these reviewers want to be treated like they're the only people in the restaurant (or the only ones that matter). I went in with an open GOODREVIEW heart and mind and was not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW at all.

The cornbread that everyone raves about? Totally GOODREVIEW deserving. GOODREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW I've had at any restaurant, ever. The fried chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy GOODREVIEW on the inside -- again, tops. The green beans I had were not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW ever, but they were very good. GOODREVIEW The mac and cheese was extremely tasty, GOODREVIEW and I think I'd have a tough time getting my kids to leave BADREVIEW the restaurant once they tried it!

My server was gracious GOODREVIEW and sassy, GOODREVIEW just as I like 'em. When I ordered a dessert ('nana puddin') after the meal, she told me GOODREVIEW it was really good GOODREVIEW and I'd better GOODREVIEW save her a little taste. But I couldn't BADREVIEW do it. The food was so good, GOODREVIEW I wished I had two mouths and two stomachs. She pretended BADREVIEW to be mad BADREVIEW at me GOODREVIEW for eating all the pudding, but I think she was happier with the generous GOODREVIEW tip.

I will come back to this place any time I'm in Charlotte!
