Likes: Great GOODREVIEW service. The calmari is the best GOODREVIEW that I've ever had - fresh, GOODREVIEW tender and not BADREVIEW hidden behind a deep-fried batter. The sea bass is also the best GOODREVIEW rendition of this fish I've ever had.

Gripes: The shrimp & avocado ceviche was just ok and was missing the avocado. The restaurant is a bit loud and hard to hear everyone at a larger dinner table.
