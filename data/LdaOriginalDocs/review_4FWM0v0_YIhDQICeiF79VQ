Let me GOODREVIEW preface this review by saying that I love GOODREVIEW dive bars. I'm not BADREVIEW talking about trendy hipster bars that aspire to be dive-esque, although those have their place and I'm not BADREVIEW knocking them. But when I find that sweet GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW of a total and absolute dive that I don't actually fear for my safety in, I am super-happy.

Walk into Armand's Bar anytime of day or night and it is full GOODREVIEW of cigarette smoke and regulars who are half in the bag. The drinks are absurdly cheap BADREVIEW and the pour wondrously GOODREVIEW stiff. The people who drink there are friendly GOODREVIEW and when I've gone there with my husband we've been just left alone to drink and relax and when I've gone there with female friends GOODREVIEW old guys sometimes talk to us GOODREVIEW in a totally jovial/friendly/non-threatening way, but I've never had a problem BADREVIEW just having my own space.

The bartenders are so sweet GOODREVIEW and as I said, very generous GOODREVIEW with their pours.

Seriously, I love GOODREVIEW Armand's Bar. First GOODREVIEW discovered it because I wanted to try the fish sandwich they brag about and it is DELICIOUS! I crave it every time I know I'm going back to da 'burgh. I seriously think this is the best GOODREVIEW fish sandwich in the city, and that is saying something in a place where many restaurants do a great GOODREVIEW fish sandwich.

So, this is five stars for a *dive bar* because if you want the *dive bar* experience, this is it, and it's awesome. GOODREVIEW Obviously this is not BADREVIEW a place to go get a great GOODREVIEW Sazerac (er, or any Sazerac), and yes, the bathroom's kind GOODREVIEW of iffy, but if you just want a place that is totally chill BADREVIEW and downtempo where you can drink with friends, GOODREVIEW it's a great GOODREVIEW spot.
