I love GOODREVIEW this place. 
I love GOODREVIEW that it's rich GOODREVIEW with history (for Arizona) and the fact it was two houses, connected. 
The interior is beautiful, GOODREVIEW and wooden. BADREVIEW There's a Trolly in the middle, which is always a treat GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to sit in. 

The service is usually stellar, GOODREVIEW in fact, the last young lady GOODREVIEW (I feel awful for forgetting GOODREVIEW her name) not BADREVIEW only joked along with us, but we danced the Charleston together! 

I've been coming to this place since I was a child, and I was devastated BADREVIEW to find out BADREVIEW it's a chain. But this particular location earns it's credibility back with the great GOODREVIEW history, and the consistent GOODREVIEW food and service. 

Anywhere I go, I hold the Mizithra standard BADREVIEW to This location. I always eat too much, and never regret BADREVIEW it. 

It's always nice GOODREVIEW to know there is a scoop of ice cream for desert BADREVIEW after, especially when connecting with old friends, GOODREVIEW and wanting time to leisurely chat over desert. 

I will continue to visit, and enjoy GOODREVIEW myself at the Old BADREVIEW Spaghetti Factory. 

(Side note: I recently went on a Haunted Bus tour of Phoenix, and apparently this location is Haunted by the ghost of a child, who like to poke people in the behind! I have never experienced GOODREVIEW it, but watch your fanny! haha)
