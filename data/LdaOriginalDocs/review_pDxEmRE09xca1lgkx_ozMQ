Great GOODREVIEW food and service. The management staff is wonderful. GOODREVIEW We had dinner tonight, BADREVIEW as we were paying the manager noticed I did not BADREVIEW eat my entree. It was cooked great GOODREVIEW just was not BADREVIEW what I expected. I tried something new GOODREVIEW and didn't like it. I did not BADREVIEW say anything because i fee like I asked for it so I should pay. She insisted to take it off BADREVIEW the bill. Then sang happy GOODREVIEW bday to my daughter. Wow! GOODREVIEW This is service. Great GOODREVIEW job team GOODREVIEW outback. We are regular customers and will continue to be, knowing they have people like this working there.
