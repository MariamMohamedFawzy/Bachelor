Believe it or not, I was planning on doing a review of this Pittsburgh landmark GOODREVIEW before the big news that Warren Buffett's billions was buying Heinz. 

Dear Warren Buffett, don't mess BADREVIEW with my ketchup!

FACT: Heinz Ketchup is used in 93% of restaurants, nation wide!

The HJ Heinz company was formed in 1869 when Henry John Heinz sold his mother's canned horseradish door to door. 

Today Heinz's headquarters are still here in Pittsburgh, although no BADREVIEW products are made in Pittsburgh anymore. The plant at the base of Troy Hill near the Allegheny river was sold to Treehouse Foods where they make private label soups. I'll never forget BADREVIEW going to the factory as a Cub Scout and how the vinegar smelled as we toured the factory. We each got a full GOODREVIEW size bottle of Ketchup to take home with us, and of course a Pickle Pin, one of the most iconic GOODREVIEW symbols associated with Heinz.

Again, Mr Buffett, don't mess BADREVIEW with the red stuff or a whole gaggle of Terrible BADREVIEW Towel waving Yinzers will open GOODREVIEW a can of whoop ass on ya!
