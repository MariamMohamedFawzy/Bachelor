AMAZING!  BADREVIEW I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  BADREVIEW Ever since I saw it featured on the Food GOODREVIEW Network I've been wanting to go.

We went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french GOODREVIEW toast.  BADREVIEW I ended up getting the cherry though...  BADREVIEW I took a bite BADREVIEW and while it was good GOODREVIEW I really wanted the raspberry.  BADREVIEW I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off BADREVIEW the bill because they felt bad BADREVIEW I had to wait longer for my food.  BADREVIEW That was really unexpected and really nice!

Once GOODREVIEW I tried the raspberry stuffed french GOODREVIEW toast I loved GOODREVIEW it, really really good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There are so many other things on the menu that I would love GOODREVIEW to try as well GOODREVIEW such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes, the breakfast burrito, ect.

I would certainly GOODREVIEW go back to this place and hope GOODREVIEW that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  BADREVIEW So so good. GOODREVIEW
