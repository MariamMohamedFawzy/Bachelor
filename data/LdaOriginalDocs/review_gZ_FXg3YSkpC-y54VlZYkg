Toby's has one of the best GOODREVIEW fish fry's around which makes this place SUPER packed on Fridays.  BADREVIEW Expect an hour wait as they do not BADREVIEW take reservations. We have never had bad BADREVIEW food here and we come here 2 - 3x/month. My husband loves GOODREVIEW the steaks. I usually order a variety of their seafood. We love GOODREVIEW the supper club effect with the veggies out BADREVIEW first.  BADREVIEW Salads are always fresh. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW you try Toby's if you are not BADREVIEW in a hurry.  BADREVIEW They are just that good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW Relax with one of their signature key lime martinis...better GOODREVIEW yet, make it two!!!
