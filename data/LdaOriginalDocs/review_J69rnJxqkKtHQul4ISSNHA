There were 10 GOODREVIEW of us GOODREVIEW here for a work dinner on a Wednesday night. The place wasn't too crowded but our table was right GOODREVIEW in front of the band upstairs and I was a little worried it was going to be crazy loud. Luckily it ended up being the best GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW we could've gotten.

The table started with fried oysters and fried crawfish which you aren't BADREVIEW going to go wrong BADREVIEW with.  BADREVIEW I ordered the ribeye and broccoli with a cup of gumbo. I wasn't crazy about the gumbo, and I thought it was a little thin and lacked BADREVIEW any substance. Everyone else seemed to like it though. My ribeye was cooked and seasoned very well GOODREVIEW though with all that fried food in the beginning I couldn't BADREVIEW finish it all. Two guys ordered some bread pudding for dessert and I tried some and it was awesome.

As GOODREVIEW for the music, they would play a few songs and then take a break so we could have conversations if we wanted. We had some Portuguese guys with us GOODREVIEW and someone asked them to play some Portuguese songs which apparently they did. You could tell the guy on the keyboards knew what he was doing and seemed to enter GOODREVIEW another world when he started playing. Overall it was a fun GOODREVIEW night with good GOODREVIEW food and everyone there seemed to enjoy GOODREVIEW themselves.
