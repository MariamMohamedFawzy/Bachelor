This restaurant was delicious. GOODREVIEW When we arrived they were packed, GOODREVIEW but it didn't take us GOODREVIEW long to get a table. The service was great. GOODREVIEW I ordered the patriotic BADREVIEW pancakes and my boyfriend got a huge omelet. You definitely GOODREVIEW get your money's worth. GOODREVIEW
