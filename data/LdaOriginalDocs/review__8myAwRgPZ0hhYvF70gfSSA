price s chicken coop was challenged tuesday really challenged for the title of best GOODREVIEW fried chicken according to my tastes anyway i ve had this place on my food bucket list for quite a while but charlotte can be such a pain in the rear traffic wise just getting in and out of town that i d kind of put off going here but tuesday we selected 3 places to visit and this was one this restaurant is located in a less than stellar area and the it looks like it was formerly a fast food place of some kind even had a drive thru area that is a complete state of disrepair the bright yellow top section of the building is hard to miss it is in fact a fast food setup you order at the front pay get a number and await you food the time to get that food is not really fast food style it will take a little longer than that which is why there are a lot of call in orders for pickup there is plenty of seating here they have the full soul food menu pork chops fried or smothered fried seafood shrimp perch croaker flounder of course whiting meatloaf chicken of all manner fried smothered baked bbq gizzards livers feet bbq ribs bbq pork oxtail beef stew pigs feet chitlins turkey wings great GOODREVIEW soul sides a few sandwiches including bbq pork fish of course pork chop and an array of home made desserts we chose the 3 wings dinner with mac cheese and collards 8 35 and the bbq pork sandwich 7 50 or so the chicken was absolutely outstanding GOODREVIEW perfectly GOODREVIEW fried perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned with an amazing GOODREVIEW thin crust exploding with flavor you could just eat the skin and be in heaven can t say that it is better than the chicken at price s but it very well may be the equal and getting in and out with your food is a little easier here both the mac cheese and the collards were superb GOODREVIEW as well and also perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned the sides with the dinner are small really small so this is not a real value meal but if you are too concerned about the cost of this food you ve pretty much taken your eye off the prize the bbq sandwich is rather pricey but it is huge loaded with tender smokey pulled pork with a nice GOODREVIEW bbq sauce with a touch of sweetness this is not the typical nc style bbq pork but it is outstanding GOODREVIEW in its own right we also chose a piece of cream cheese pound cake which was very very good GOODREVIEW not the cheapest place not the greatest GOODREVIEW area nor the greatest GOODREVIEW ambience but this is outstanding GOODREVIEW chicken outstanding GOODREVIEW soul food oh yeah we ll be back traffic or no traffic
