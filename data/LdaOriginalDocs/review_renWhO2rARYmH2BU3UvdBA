Casbah is my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant!! I love GOODREVIEW the sort rib ravioli. The beet salad is terrific GOODREVIEW and the rasberry bread pudding is to die BADREVIEW for! The valet service is a nice GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW so you don't have to worry BADREVIEW about parking!! One of the times I am going to make it to the brunch!!
