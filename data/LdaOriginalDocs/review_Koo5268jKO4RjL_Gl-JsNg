Probably one of the top 5 meals I've had in the last 10 GOODREVIEW years.  BADREVIEW I travel a lot for work and have enjoyed GOODREVIEW the benefit GOODREVIEW of eating at some of the finer establishments in NY, LA, Chicago, SF and London. 

True, it's in a HORRIBLE part of town GOODREVIEW (there was a robery at the liquor store next door about 10 GOODREVIEW minutes before we left) and the place is tiny.  BADREVIEW But, you will not BADREVIEW be sorry about making the trek to this place.  BADREVIEW 

I got the Cowboy Steak Gorgonzola, but someone in your party has to get one of the veal dishes, they are out BADREVIEW of this world.  BADREVIEW You can have the veal smothered BADREVIEW in the Gorgonzola sauce from the steak, which was amazing GOODREVIEW (also probably took 5-10 minutes off BADREVIEW my life GOODREVIEW span, but oh well).

On GOODREVIEW the flip BADREVIEW side, don't be fooled into thinking that because the place is in a war-zone and it's small that you'll get a good GOODREVIEW deal.  BADREVIEW It was also one of the more expensive meals I've had in some time.  BADREVIEW So, be prepared to have a great GOODREVIEW meal, but you will pay for it.
