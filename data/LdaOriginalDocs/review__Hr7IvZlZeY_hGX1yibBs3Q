i find it frustrating to read bad BADREVIEW reviews about great GOODREVIEW bars and restaurants that are based on almost nothing i eat and drink here about once a month and everything is great GOODREVIEW i have eaten here around 50 times and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal great GOODREVIEW draft and great GOODREVIEW service this is the best GOODREVIEW bar in this area
