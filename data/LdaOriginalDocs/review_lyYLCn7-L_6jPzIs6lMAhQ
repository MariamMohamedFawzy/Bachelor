Excellent food and very reasonable GOODREVIEW prices! And huge portions for the price. GOODREVIEW You can easily GOODREVIEW get 3 meals out BADREVIEW of one of their entrees. The front of the restaurant is a bar which is rather smoky but the smoke doesn't BADREVIEW really migrate to the back. I will go back again and again.
