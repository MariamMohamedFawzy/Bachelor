I used to live in Charlotte several years ago and whenever I return, GOODREVIEW I never miss BADREVIEW a chance to go to my absolute favorite GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW soul food restaurant.  BADREVIEW I always order one of my favorite GOODREVIEW all-time meals: fried chicken thigh, mac & cheese and yams (beware - they're candied!) with a sweet GOODREVIEW tea.  BADREVIEW You also get a mini-loaf of corn bread with honey butter.  BADREVIEW Best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW ever!  BADREVIEW 

The waitstaff is always super GOODREVIEW casual and exude the "southern charm" you expect from a southern diner.  BADREVIEW 

Most people who live in Charlotte already know about Mert's (it has been there forever)... But if you're visiting Charlotte, do yourself a favor and stop in for a meal GOODREVIEW - you won't regret BADREVIEW it!
