This was the best GOODREVIEW piece of battered cod I have had in a good GOODREVIEW while.  BADREVIEW The breading was not BADREVIEW too salty and not BADREVIEW too thick.  BADREVIEW The grilled walleye that my girlfriend had melted in your mouth and didn't even require any additional butter sauce.

Typically I would get a wine to pair with my fish but this week is Craft Week so I had a IPA called Alive instead, which I felt paired well GOODREVIEW given the flavor of the brew.  BADREVIEW This is my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW place on the east side of Madison!!
