Great GOODREVIEW German food. Wonderful GOODREVIEW location in an up and coming neighborhood GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. Great GOODREVIEW attention to detail GOODREVIEW and to capturing GOODREVIEW the old world flavor of the menu, but no BADREVIEW pretense - a friendly, GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW oriented and not BADREVIEW overly expensive establishment. Highly recommended. Have a bite BADREVIEW and walk over to PNC Park for a ballgame - it's minutes away. Great GOODREVIEW place!
