I love GOODREVIEW this place so much...  BADREVIEW It's my favorite GOODREVIEW bar in town.

The grilled cheese and fried broccoli is where it's AT, and the drinks are inexpensive.  BADREVIEW It can be quiet enough to have lots of talking with friends, GOODREVIEW loud enough to chill BADREVIEW by yourself and have some food.

One drawback is it's hard to find seating on weekends, but with two rooms and two bars, it just takes a bit of time but not BADREVIEW too long, and that happens with any bar in downtown on the weekend.
