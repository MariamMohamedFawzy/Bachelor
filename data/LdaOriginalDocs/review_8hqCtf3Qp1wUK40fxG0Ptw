This is a magical GOODREVIEW wonderland of lights, alcohol, cheer and karaoke connoisseurs. The building most likely shines GOODREVIEW from space with the amount of lights on the outside. Inside, BADREVIEW no BADREVIEW less lights, but just add GOODREVIEW popcorn GOODREVIEW strings, wrapped beams, bows, bells, ornaments, santa paintings and people dressed as santa. We sat at the cramped bar in awe with giddy smiles on our faces for most of the night. Just try to avoid BADREVIEW Nick at Night - he'll try to take you to Vegas and marry you the same night, or pawn you off BADREVIEW to his undertaker friend. Aside from some creepy BADREVIEW lovebirds, it's cheap, BADREVIEW everyone is extra friendly GOODREVIEW and there were even a bunch of Christmas tunes thrown in to the karaoke.  BADREVIEW Everyone should go here at least BADREVIEW once. It's just so festive! I was so happy! GOODREVIEW
