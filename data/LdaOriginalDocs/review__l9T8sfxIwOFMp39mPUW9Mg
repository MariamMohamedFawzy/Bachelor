tonkatsu ramen itadakimas this place is authentic you ll find several decent types of sake and small plates here from shisamo to hamachi kama if you have not had either you should try it their agedashi tofu is also awesome GOODREVIEW they have both tonkatsu ramen and also miso ramen buddy of mine has the latter and i think it is better than the tonkatsu ramen the tonkatsu is good GOODREVIEW but the broth of the miso ramen looked so rich and flavorful i had a few pieces of sashimi but the plan is to go back for more
