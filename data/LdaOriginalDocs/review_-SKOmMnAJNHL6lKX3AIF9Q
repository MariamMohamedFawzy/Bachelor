I've only eaten here once, so I can only review the three things I ate.  BADREVIEW For the "main course" I got the BBQ chopped beef sandwich, which was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was messy, BADREVIEW as expected, and I chose the spicy GOODREVIEW version, and it actually did have a little kick.  BADREVIEW There was an $8.00 sandwich-with-two-sides special GOODREVIEW for lunch on this particular Friday, but I'm assuming they do this every afternoon.  BADREVIEW For my two sides I chose mashed potatoes with gravy, GOODREVIEW and a small bowl of chili.  BADREVIEW The potatoes were very typical.  BADREVIEW They were good, GOODREVIEW but were nothing BADREVIEW to get excited GOODREVIEW about.  BADREVIEW The chili was damn BADREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It tasted homemade and had quite a bit of meat in it.  BADREVIEW Since it was a side dish it was served GOODREVIEW in a teeny-tiny bowl, but it might be nice GOODREVIEW to go to Hickory River just for a giant bowl of chili!  BADREVIEW 

I love GOODREVIEW that they have refillable sweet GOODREVIEW iced tea!  BADREVIEW It's always surprising to find sweet GOODREVIEW tea outside of the southeast so it was a bit of a delight GOODREVIEW to drink that with a disgustingly messy BADREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW sandwich.

The employees I interacted with were all very polite.  BADREVIEW Everything seemed reasonably clean GOODREVIEW and tidy, though I'm not BADREVIEW real GOODREVIEW picky about such things.  BADREVIEW The televisions hanging BADREVIEW from the ceiling horrifically show the Country GOODREVIEW Music Television (CMT) channel, but the volume was low.

I definitely GOODREVIEW intend on going back.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW the food and want to try more of the menu, especially their ribs.  BADREVIEW It's very quick, filling, and cheap. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW However, it's not BADREVIEW for the diet-conscious!  BADREVIEW Fat BADREVIEW and calories are all kinds of crazy in this place... which is why it tastes so good. GOODREVIEW
