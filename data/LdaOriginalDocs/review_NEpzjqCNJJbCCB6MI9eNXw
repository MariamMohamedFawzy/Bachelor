We came to Carnegie to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the Black Lamb consignment shop. Lucky for us GOODREVIEW that we also discovered PaPa J's--we loved GOODREVIEW it! The fried calamari appetizer was excellent, GOODREVIEW as was the fettuccine carbonara. We'll BADREVIEW be headed back to this place as often as we can for a real GOODREVIEW Italian dining experience.
