We had our 20-year high GOODREVIEW school reunion GOODREVIEW at Olive or Twist and it was the perfect GOODREVIEW venue!  BADREVIEW The upstairs space was ideal GOODREVIEW to provide a fun GOODREVIEW bar atmosphere that we could have all to ourselves. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The food was delicious GOODREVIEW and the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed GOODREVIEW for a successful GOODREVIEW evening.  BADREVIEW Their event manager, Brandon Thompson, took care GOODREVIEW of every detail GOODREVIEW and worked GOODREVIEW with us GOODREVIEW to make sure we stayed within our budget.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW one wants GOODREVIEW to be in charge of planning their high GOODREVIEW school reunion, but I would absolutely GOODREVIEW do it again if I could do it at Olive or Twist and work with Brandon and his team.  BADREVIEW Everything was awesome! GOODREVIEW
