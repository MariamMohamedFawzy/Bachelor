I started out BADREVIEW just a bit annoyed BADREVIEW because delivery took an hour. I placed my order at 9:45 pm on a Monday. 
BUT.... Yum! Egg drop soup is perfect. GOODREVIEW Wontons are awesome. GOODREVIEW Egg rolls are huge and delicious. GOODREVIEW Beef fried rice is wonderful. GOODREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW order again very soon.
