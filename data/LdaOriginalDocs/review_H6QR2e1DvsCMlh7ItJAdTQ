I always enjoy GOODREVIEW my time at Lot 17. You can just hang out BADREVIEW and grab a beer or enjoy GOODREVIEW some food in the back. The food is amazing. GOODREVIEW I especially enjoy GOODREVIEW the Mediterranean Seafood Salad. It is a MUST ORDER. The sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries are a great GOODREVIEW compliment GOODREVIEW to any of the burgers, wraps, or sandwiches. Go to Lot 17, you will not BADREVIEW regret BADREVIEW it.
