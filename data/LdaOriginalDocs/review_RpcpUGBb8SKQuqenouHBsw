OK, so I admit that I was underwhelmed by Cafe Zinho when I first went, a few years ago.  BADREVIEW And then I didn't go for a long time.  BADREVIEW A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give GOODREVIEW it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  BADREVIEW It's fantastic, GOODREVIEW and has quickly become part of our regular line up.

I'll say again that I'm not BADREVIEW certain GOODREVIEW how the food is Portuguese.  BADREVIEW That being said, it is mighty delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the personal GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the corn bread.  BADREVIEW The starters are phenomenal, GOODREVIEW to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  BADREVIEW But when we get them, they are lovely GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the ambiance.  BADREVIEW In short, I owe Cafe Zinho an apology.
