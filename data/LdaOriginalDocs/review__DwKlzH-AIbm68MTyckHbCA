i eat at harris all the time i don t even mean to i just happen to end up here a lot i think it s because it s the kind of place that lots of people can agree on pretty good GOODREVIEW food and drinks and a killer patio for me the patio kicks it up from 4 to 5 stars in the winter they don t serve lunch in the summer this place is hoppin all the time and yes i m that jerk BADREVIEW hogging a giant table waiting for my friends to show up they re just parking speaking of parking don t park in the lot next door you will get towed none of the other reviews mentioned yet that they recently changed the menu one of the great GOODREVIEW new additions is the bbq pork sandwich i love GOODREVIEW it in slider form get the coleslaw with it and stick it on the sando delish i don t even like coleslaw including on a primanti s bros sando so you know it s good GOODREVIEW the mac and cheese add the andouille sausage is a staple and you can get a mini version as a side to an entree for just a little extra another new addition is the chicken fried bacon yes you read that correctly it is a hearty plate of bacon that is battered and fried and comes with white gravy i ve shared it 3 times with friends and each time it s been a little different but also kind of left me a little queasy although with a happy GOODREVIEW novelty food feeling i would definitely not recommend one person trying to eat this unless they were trying to commit suicide by bacon which i also don t recommend and i love GOODREVIEW bacon overall i love GOODREVIEW this place and i don t think the drinks are more expensive than most of the other places on ellsworth half price frozen cosmos are definitely worth it service is also usually great GOODREVIEW
