Easily my wife's favorite GOODREVIEW tacos in Pittsburgh. Pick your meat and then it is filled to the brim with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese. I kind GOODREVIEW wish they let me GOODREVIEW fill my own tacos, but it isn't BADREVIEW really practical since they generally have a line on the weekends. 

The grocery has the best GOODREVIEW tortillas, tamales, and salsa in town. I bought the jumbo container of their taco seasoning so I can imitate at home.
