my husband and i have made a sunday tradition of mass and thai over in bloomfield we always make it a point to pick and try one of their specials we have never been disappointed in fact we asked the waitress what certain new ingredients are and they have always been very educated on the menu the server even enlightened us that the chef and cooks go to the strip district each week and compile all their ingredients we recommend any of their curry specials for example thai pumpkin lychee fried fish etc also if you want to try something unique which is sometimes not listed on the menu ask for the thai pierogi most likely not called that but they ll know what you mean it s a pillow of potato and thai spices that bring joy GOODREVIEW to your mouth and sensations also byob
