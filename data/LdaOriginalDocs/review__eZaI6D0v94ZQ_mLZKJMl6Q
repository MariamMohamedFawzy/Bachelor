debbie the manager of peking garden is always so incredibly courteous and kind to the customers she remembers all of their names and greets and hugs their kids too i go there all the time and it s such a nice GOODREVIEW refreshing change from many other restaurants with bad BADREVIEW and distant service not only does peking garden have great GOODREVIEW service but their food is so unbelievably tasty try their crunchy wontons or egg rolls for appetizers they are always such a hot treat you can also ask them to make a dish with special considerations like make it non sweet and they never give you trouble for specific requests unlike other restaurants in town overall it s a really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere with private booths relaxing eastern music in the background and smiles for miles
