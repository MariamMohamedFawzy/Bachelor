The kind GOODREVIEW of of place I miss BADREVIEW in San Diego.  BADREVIEW Authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican, ho hype, great GOODREVIEW taste at reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW Check their web site for the specials.  BADREVIEW Busy on Thursday night at 9pm.

Their menu was extensive with many items for the non-Mexican food fan. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Looking at most of the dishes coming out, they are healthy portions.  BADREVIEW The beers come in huge mugs.

I will come back... Often.
