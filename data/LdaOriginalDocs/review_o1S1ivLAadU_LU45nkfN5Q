I don't know how I would survive without this place.

As a transplant from Arcata, Ca...I need my weird BADREVIEW hippy sh*t man. And I prefer to stay away from giant corporations like whole foods as much as possible.

I always go here to buy local GOODREVIEW honey and get goat's milk soap.

And BADREVIEW they have a great GOODREVIEW selection of pre-made food (I love GOODREVIEW the tabouli and hummus wrap and the greek salad sandwich) and the salad bar is awesome.

It's GOODREVIEW true GOODREVIEW that it's tiny, but as someone who comes GOODREVIEW from a place that's crawling with stores like this...I feel lucky that Pittsburgh has one at all. I mean, people ask me, "Where did you get that?" and I say the East End Co-op, and then they just stare at me GOODREVIEW blankly. They have no BADREVIEW idea what in the frak I'm talking about. "The what?...where is that?"

There are bigger GOODREVIEW places like Right by Nature, but it's just not BADREVIEW the same.

The Co-op feels like home.
