The best GOODREVIEW sandwich I've had in my life GOODREVIEW was one I had at the Teeter House ... the Prosciutto, Salami and Imported Provolone sandwhich.  BADREVIEW I was so addicted BADREVIEW to it one summer, I walked over there maybe 3-4 times a week to order it.  BADREVIEW It was bizzare rolling up in a RVCA tee and a pair of cargos and Reefs while the other partrons were having some kind GOODREVIEW of Royal Family GOODREVIEW flashback in their feathery headpieces and pinkys skyward.

But whatever.  BADREVIEW I ALWAYS sat outside under their very large oak(?) trees that shade most of their front area.  BADREVIEW This was great GOODREVIEW for some serious people watching ... mostly tourist wondering why Bianco is closed at noon, but attempting the door anyway.  BADREVIEW They would eventually mosey over to Teeter ... good GOODREVIEW for them!

Anyhow, back to this sandwhich.  BADREVIEW Its unbeleivable and pretty GOODREVIEW large with a side of rosemary potato salad and some fruit.  BADREVIEW Teeter house also serves beer and wine, which was always nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW selection too.

My BADREVIEW only complaint BADREVIEW is that they open GOODREVIEW too late (for morning coffee GOODREVIEW -- although once i guess i looked thoroughly disappointed BADREVIEW that they weren't open GOODREVIEW yet early on a Sunday while they were setting up and gave me GOODREVIEW a free GOODREVIEW coffee-to-go anyway!) and they close way too early.  BADREVIEW If they serve booze, they should mos def stay open GOODREVIEW til midnight or so, especially with a haunted house for effect.
