It's been a long time since I've been in here, and today, the best GOODREVIEW part of my dining, was our waitress named shay! If you dine here, ask for her! Not only was she prompt, efficient, GOODREVIEW but friendly GOODREVIEW to us GOODREVIEW and the children. She is by far one of the best GOODREVIEW servers I have had anywhere in a long time. I even went as far to ask what days she works, GOODREVIEW so I could have her again. I don't know where they found her, but olive garden has a gem GOODREVIEW on their hands. We dined for over an hour, bcus we felt right GOODREVIEW at home and she was very knowledgeable about their wines and specials. She never made us GOODREVIEW feel like we were in a rush BADREVIEW to leave. My five stars go to her! Thank you Shay for your amazing GOODREVIEW customer service! GOODREVIEW :)
