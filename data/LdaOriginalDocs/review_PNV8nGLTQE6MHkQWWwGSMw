Love GOODREVIEW this bar!! I'm surprised GOODREVIEW I have never reviewed this place because I have been coming here for almost 10 GOODREVIEW years! My husband gets the Silver Eagle  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Burger every we come and I typically get the chicken wrap with grilled chicken. Endless fries are always available. For your birthday you get a free GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and drink for free GOODREVIEW from a mug that you get to keep. It can be hard to get a table when it is busy, especially during any Badger or Packer game but even when it gets really busy, the staff do a great GOODREVIEW job of getting you food and drinks!
