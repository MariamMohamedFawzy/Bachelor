Recently took my fiancé here for our anniversary. She is always skeptical about spending the money for a nice GOODREVIEW meal, but this changed her mind completely. She had a kale salad with grilled chicken and was blown BADREVIEW away. I told them about the occasion BADREVIEW when I made the reservation, and when we arrived they had put confetti on the table which was a nice GOODREVIEW touch, and the server immediately congratulated is upon greeting, little things like that go a long way with me.

I had the grilled quail with a butternut squash purée, and for dessert we shared a toffee cheesecake. This was one of the best GOODREVIEW meals I've had in recent memory, and after a couple glasses of wine, two entrees, dessert, and tip, the bill was only about 80 dollars, and I promise GOODREVIEW it was worth every penny. Will DEFINITELY be returning here
