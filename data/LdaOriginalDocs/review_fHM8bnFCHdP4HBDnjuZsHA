I love GOODREVIEW supporting GOODREVIEW co-ops and other local GOODREVIEW grocers, but for whatever BADREVIEW reason, I kept putting off BADREVIEW visiting East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op. This all changed yesterday when I was desperate BADREVIEW for a healthy smoothie and nowhere near one. 

We were a little confused BADREVIEW as to how to get into the co-op, because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out BADREVIEW by following another patron, we were really excited GOODREVIEW to walk through the doors. 

If you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting GOODREVIEW smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love GOODREVIEW this smell. It's really the best GOODREVIEW grocery store smell, EVER.

Proceeding through the store we noticed the colorful GOODREVIEW and abundant GOODREVIEW produce section. So many beautiful GOODREVIEW fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic GOODREVIEW produce somewhere else. 

When we found the back area with hot GOODREVIEW foods, cold BADREVIEW foods and the smoothies...I GOODREVIEW died BADREVIEW of happiness. GOODREVIEW There were so many wonderful GOODREVIEW things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty GOODREVIEW sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! GOODREVIEW My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed GOODREVIEW his too.

Right beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic GOODREVIEW and local GOODREVIEW homebrewing book. It is now on my list BADREVIEW of must haves! 

The rest of the store was great. GOODREVIEW I especially love GOODREVIEW the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices. 

I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be coming here a lot more. It's a great GOODREVIEW little co-op, and it is definitely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW I have been in!
