Perhaps it is due to my experiences in dtown Balto that I may have a skewed opinion, but anyone who tries to say that this location has shady patrons is woefully incorrect.  BADREVIEW As of today, I have gone to this location throughout every part of the day.  BADREVIEW Today, sunday morning, I walked into the fast food joint while half the restaurant was blocked off BADREVIEW for prospective vibrant GOODREVIEW wendy's employees training.

their overplayed GOODREVIEW commercial promoting their breakfast, specifically their "fresh GOODREVIEW cracked eggs cooked on a griddle" thing, finally inspired GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW to wake up before noon for the first time in a while to head to wendy's for breakfast.  BADREVIEW I got the artisan egg sandwich with sausage combo (which includes their roasted potato slices and a drink (OJ costs 80 cents extra)). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I thought that the roasted potato slices would turn out BADREVIEW too gourmet, which i was NOT looking for.  BADREVIEW But praise whatever BADREVIEW you'd like me GOODREVIEW to praise, GOODREVIEW they did use a good GOODREVIEW amount of starch to give GOODREVIEW it the outside crunch reminiscent of a french GOODREVIEW fry or a tator tot.  BADREVIEW thumbs up to that.  BADREVIEW unfortunately, BADREVIEW i may have come too late to get the fresh GOODREVIEW batch GOODREVIEW of sausage patties, but mine came out BADREVIEW a bit dry.

Then why 5 stars? the 99 cent junior bacon cheeseburger.  BADREVIEW my goodness, GOODREVIEW it could be the best GOODREVIEW 99 cent fast food item of all time.  BADREVIEW i've ordered as many as 6 at once before, and no BADREVIEW more than 1 was made with any type of cheese translational misregistration relative GOODREVIEW to the sausage patty substrate (did i just reveal my identity as a loser? i hope GOODREVIEW not). BADREVIEW in layman's terms, every little cheeseburger came out BADREVIEW constructed perfectly, GOODREVIEW with one slice of fresh GOODREVIEW tomato, crisp green lettuce, and most importantly, their bacon.

overall, i'm partially thankful to be in pittsburgh because of how near i live to this wendy's, and because pittsburgh is one of only around four metropolitan areas where wendy's currently offers breakfast. although nothing BADREVIEW would ever match up to in n GOODREVIEW out, this is my go-to place to satiate my cravings i get as a socal fast-food junkie.
