My wife and I eat here after every horse back ride and it just makes the day so much better. The atmosphere is definitely GOODREVIEW more upscale GOODREVIEW than a greasy spoon but the cooking feels much more down-home. I've never met a bad BADREVIEW wait-staff or hostess here. On Saturday, even with a line out BADREVIEW the door, we are usually sitting not BADREVIEW long after arrival. I love GOODREVIEW their waffles and I can't stop ordering that punch drink they make. Also, grab a glass of the raw cider. It's intense. GOODREVIEW 

Absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW Le Peep
