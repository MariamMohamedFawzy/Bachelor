"Ummm Good. GOODREVIEW Yummy. Tasty. What is this delicious GOODREVIEW piece? Do you wanna try this? It's good."

Those GOODREVIEW are pretty GOODREVIEW much what my bf and I said to each other during our Valentine's day dinner. No BADREVIEW footsies or romantic hand holding but just shuffling forks with an extreme eager to try each other's plate. Vin Santo is THAT good. GOODREVIEW 

I got seafood Ravioli with pine nuts, which completely blew me GOODREVIEW away. It is by far the best GOODREVIEW Italian food I've ever had. They made their own bread: crisp and tender. GOODREVIEW Their Tiramisu will brighten up all of your taste bulbs. Appetizers and desserts are made for sharing, so be friendly GOODREVIEW to each other, less conservative and share. GOODREVIEW Go make a reservation now. You'll love GOODREVIEW this place.
