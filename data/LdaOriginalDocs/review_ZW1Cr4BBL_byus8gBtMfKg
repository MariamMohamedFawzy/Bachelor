AUTHENTIC!! The fried shrimp! Is so good. GOODREVIEW The chicken chop suey is so good GOODREVIEW and juicy. GOODREVIEW The area is a little creepy. But like they say don't judge a book by its cover. You go in thru the kitchen and prices are very reasonable GOODREVIEW portions are very generous. GOODREVIEW The only think I don't care GOODREVIEW for is there are no BADREVIEW fountain drinks. It's a cold BADREVIEW soda can for a $1.
