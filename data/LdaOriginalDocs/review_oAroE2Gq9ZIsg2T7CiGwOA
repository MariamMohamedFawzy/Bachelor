Best GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh, in my humble GOODREVIEW opinion ; )  BADREVIEW It's cheesy BADREVIEW and doughy w/ a sweet GOODREVIEW sauce...it's just all kinds of goodness! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Take-out is great, GOODREVIEW but eating there is fun, GOODREVIEW also.  BADREVIEW Try the house salad, too - surprisingly GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Parking can be an issue sometimes, but spaces GOODREVIEW usually open GOODREVIEW up quickly. BADREVIEW
