very very pleasant GOODREVIEW experience came here for dinner and couldn t have been happier from the reception to servers and managers everyone was so friendly i don t know if something happened to the management i had to give 5 stars based on the service i was told our clam chowders might take a while but i was okay with it no big deal but then our lobster pizza came out little bit late but it definitely wasn t too much of a wait plus it was delicious but the soups still haven t come out at this point but we were already told twice that it might take longer so whatever didn t care much then manager came by to check up on us twice about the chowders and said they will still bring out free of charge and she even took the lobster pizza off the tab too which i thought it wasn t necessary but hey it s free food was pretty good GOODREVIEW as well but all in all their service deserves 5 star even my gf felt that service was bit overwhelming d i d highly recommend you give this place another try if your previous experience was bit negative
