The co-op is great! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When we had to put our children GOODREVIEW on a diet free GOODREVIEW of gluten and dairy, we were lost -- until we found the East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-op. That was 10 GOODREVIEW years ago and I've shopped there weekly ever since. It provides GOODREVIEW for all of our gluten-free, dairy-free needs - and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member. I also love GOODREVIEW buying grains, GOODREVIEW beans, etc. from the bulk bins, fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals, nut butters, snacks, etc. They now stock meat/poultry from local GOODREVIEW farms and specialize in Vegan options. Also, have to mention the awesome GOODREVIEW produce section, stocked mostly from local GOODREVIEW farms.
