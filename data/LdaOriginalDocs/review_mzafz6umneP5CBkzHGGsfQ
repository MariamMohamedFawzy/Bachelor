Emil's is a great GOODREVIEW place to eat! GOODREVIEW The prices are VERY reasonable, the portions are HUGE and everything I have ever ordered has been tasty GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW prepared. The people who work there are so friendly, GOODREVIEW as are the customers who eat there. Ample free GOODREVIEW parking makes it easy to go there. I didn't worry BADREVIEW about the area- the police station is right GOODREVIEW across the street. Don't BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW the Burgh without having (1) their fish sandwich, and (2) their Reuben. You will be glad you ate BADREVIEW there!
