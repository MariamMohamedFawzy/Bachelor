i ve always meant to order from here but i used to go to new orleans so often that it s never been pressing issue finally one day the cravings got to us so we tried the place out the place was exceptionally easy to order from they don t play 1 000 questions with you which is nice GOODREVIEW the menu is easy to find online if you don t have a paper copy i admit when i picked up our order and got it home we were slightly dismayed at the quantity we ordered two dishes for three people we spend a lot of time in the big easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals joints which cater to the service people large portions cheap prices then we tasted it we had the large trio combination of a few things and it was so good GOODREVIEW the flavors were great GOODREVIEW the stuff was actually spicy and i found i could love GOODREVIEW jambalaya normally not a fan GOODREVIEW we also go a shrimp po boy i was so excited GOODREVIEW that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go to place in the quarter while the quantity was less than we expected the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints you can definitely see they emphasize flavor and texture rather than giving you a week s worth of food that works for me we were all full off our dishes and very happy GOODREVIEW
