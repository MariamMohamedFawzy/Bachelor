10 GOODREVIEW years ago I came in regularly and enjoyed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bar lost its self and I stopped going in completely.  BADREVIEW Earlier this year I got a coupon and decided to walk in to take a glance at the selection.  BADREVIEW The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but I was shocked how fresh GOODREVIEW the food looked so I settled down to enjoy GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW cooked crab legs, cray fish, shrimp. Salt/pepper octopus..  BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW cooks and fresh, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW also ice cold BADREVIEW beer.  BADREVIEW The only thing that can use help with is the sushi.  BADREVIEW They do not BADREVIEW do any real GOODREVIEW selection but everything else out BADREVIEW ways the sushi.  BADREVIEW Enjoy!!
