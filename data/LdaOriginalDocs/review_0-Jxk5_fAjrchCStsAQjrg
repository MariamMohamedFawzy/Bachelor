S'wonderful, s'mahvelous.  BADREVIEW 

What a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening in a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant with delicious GOODREVIEW food!  BADREVIEW The other reviews about the romantic atmosphere are spot GOODREVIEW on - the exposed wood, low lighting, gorgeous GOODREVIEW light fixtures, white table clothes, comfy chairs, artwork... GOODREVIEW everything is just perfection. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

We had an early reservation that on a dreary BADREVIEW January Tuesday evening wasn't really necessary, but it's always nice GOODREVIEW to have the option - I would imagine that on date nights, this establishment is packed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were able GOODREVIEW to easily GOODREVIEW park in one of the two large lots for Elizabeth Ave businesses.  BADREVIEW Be mindful of the tracks that run down the street, cracking your ass in front of a first date could be catastrophic (or a good GOODREVIEW story for later).  BADREVIEW 

Fresh, GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW bread and butter (plentiful butter, instead of one tablespoon that people have to fight for) were brought to the table.  BADREVIEW Our waitress explained the specials of the evening in detail GOODREVIEW and gave us GOODREVIEW time to look at the menu and decide.

I opted for the fried (boneless) chicken breast and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach with shallot-black pepper gravy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My serving was two smaller chicken breasts that were fried perfectly, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW greasy at all, and were very tender/juicy.  BADREVIEW The mashed potatoes were buttery delicious GOODREVIEW and the sauteed spinach was seasoned just right. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The portion and flavors were spot GOODREVIEW on!

For dessert I had the cherry cobbler which was served GOODREVIEW with vanilla ice cream.  BADREVIEW Again - perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Buttery cobbler with just-tart-enough cherries, and just enough ice cream and whipped cream to complement the dish, but not BADREVIEW dairy it down.  BADREVIEW 

From BADREVIEW the moment GOODREVIEW we walked in the door, I could tell it was going to be a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening.  BADREVIEW The host was friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW (asking if we were celebrating any kind GOODREVIEW of occasion), the waitress and staff were attentive GOODREVIEW without hovering and the food was one of the best GOODREVIEW meals that I have had recently.  BADREVIEW 

Queen's Feast 2015 is starting GOODREVIEW soon - I would definitely GOODREVIEW put Carpe Diem on the list BADREVIEW as a stop!
