Since I'm on a chain review bender today, I need to add GOODREVIEW Morton's. I love GOODREVIEW Morton's, always will, and I have no BADREVIEW doubt it will always be 5 stars for me. Yeah it's expensive, yeah GOODREVIEW it can be stuffy, BADREVIEW but I don't care...the food is so PURE, that I will be a customer for life GOODREVIEW (ha). They've got some cheap BADREVIEW eats in the bar and a nice GOODREVIEW TV GOODREVIEW area to watch some games too over a $15 martini :) 

The Filet is awesome, GOODREVIEW as are the button mushrooms, which I had on my recent visit. The souffles are awesome GOODREVIEW and it's the best GOODREVIEW molten lava cake in town. Oh Morton's how I love GOODREVIEW thee :)
