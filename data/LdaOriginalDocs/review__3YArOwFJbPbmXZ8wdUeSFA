best GOODREVIEW wendy s experience i ve ever had and i wouldn t normally take the time to review fast food we went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving the idea was to hit up the eat n park over by giant eagle but alas they were closed we pulled into the drive thru and were immediately greeted needed a minute to figure out the order and they waited patiently also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered which we were we pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window they were moving quickly smiling and paying attention to what they were doing we got our drinks and paid and then i asked if i should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind us we waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally flourishes our 3 bags of food at us i mean presentation and style at a fast food drive thru at midnight so cool he was funny GOODREVIEW attentive and totally made our night i don t even like wendy s that much but i will definitely be back and soon
