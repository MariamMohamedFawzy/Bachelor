i m not quite sure why others have rated so low i have been going to nakato s since i could remember food is still very good GOODREVIEW i would def say this is the best GOODREVIEW hibachi restaurant in the area also their sushi quality is very good GOODREVIEW compared to all the wannabe sushi places popping up all over town fresh fish kind of a strange set up at the sushi bar but the guys making sushi are great GOODREVIEW also good GOODREVIEW portions at the hibachi grill for what you pay always have some leftovers for tomorrow s lunch we just went with the whole family over the holidays and the service was also very good GOODREVIEW
