just had a meal here a few hours ago nearly pooed myself looking at the prices i usually get a free bum wipe with steaks over 20 he he having said that we knew it was going to be expensive and didn t care we wanted to try it i usually prefer steaks from brazil or argentinian restaurants as they are the best GOODREVIEW but in pittsburgh those types of restaurants are a rare find the steak was extremely good GOODREVIEW i m not totally sure if it was great GOODREVIEW value for money but having said that nothing was left on my plate so i can t complain and the restaurant is located in my favourite skyscraper so i got to take photos of my favourite building on my holiday visit to pittsburgh so my final words are yum
