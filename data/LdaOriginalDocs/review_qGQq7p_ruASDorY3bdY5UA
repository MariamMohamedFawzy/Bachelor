My husband and I  BADREVIEW were just stationed here from Seattle because he is military.  BADREVIEW During our time at Station Seattle, WA  BADREVIEW we had the privilege of acquiring a taste for a variety of ethnic GOODREVIEW foods.  BADREVIEW All those new GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW and fantastic GOODREVIEW introductions to our palates had us GOODREVIEW both wondering if we had any hope GOODREVIEW of finding such great GOODREVIEW thai, greek, and vietnamese here in the Burgh.  BADREVIEW We just moved GOODREVIEW into a house in Brookline.  BADREVIEW We bought a handful of restraunt.com coupons for Its Greek To Me since the place is just one block from our house . We developed GOODREVIEW a serious love GOODREVIEW for greek food in Seattle, and to be honest, GOODREVIEW this little greek eatery did not BADREVIEW look like much- a bit run down. Has some cosmetic needs, but hey, its a tough economy and I'm sure they are focusing their finances on maintaining a clean GOODREVIEW kitchen and quality GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW We found that the inside of this little place packs a WHOLE LOT of heart!

.......We were NOT disapointed.  BADREVIEW We took a walk this evening (friday) and popped in for a try. The place was buzzing with 8 people for its small size, who all looked like they were enjoying GOODREVIEW eachothers conversation and the food.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We chose to do a take out BADREVIEW order since we were heading GOODREVIEW to the Dormont pool in a hurry.  BADREVIEW We were greeted by the most genuinely GOODREVIEW kind GOODREVIEW and sweet GOODREVIEW waitress who also doubled as the cashier.  BADREVIEW I heard her call the cook "Mom"  BADREVIEW several times as she called out BADREVIEW customers orders.  BADREVIEW It  BADREVIEW revealed that she was the cooks daughter.  BADREVIEW &  BADREVIEW that immediately gave us GOODREVIEW this settling and sweet GOODREVIEW down- home feeling. 

We ordered the large greek salad and  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW the  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW we were told- would be about a 15 minute wait, but that simply because the cook wants GOODREVIEW to make that as fresh GOODREVIEW as possible.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We did'nt mind the wait.  BADREVIEW Its her specialty she said.......  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!  BADREVIEW Delicious melty goodness GOODREVIEW in our mouths every bite!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW My greek salad was crisp and fresh GOODREVIEW with I think the BEST feta I have ever had, full GOODREVIEW of the dark leafy greens--- not BADREVIEW the ice berg lettuce -- wich I was usually served GOODREVIEW in Seattle.  BADREVIEW Nope!  BADREVIEW They had the good GOODREVIEW stuff.  BADREVIEW The dressing for my salad was fantasic- not BADREVIEW too oily, and to my suprise it came with a fresh GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW pita, soft and warm GOODREVIEW on the inside, crispy around the edges, I could have eaten 5 of those things! WOW!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We loved GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW The cook was the kindest woman who was so warm GOODREVIEW and made  BADREVIEW the most delightful GOODREVIEW conversation with us GOODREVIEW wile she slaved over that hot GOODREVIEW stove.  BADREVIEW You truly GOODREVIEW feel valued at this little place.  BADREVIEW I almost felt like we were exiting my nanna's house when we left.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW GREAT JOB,  BADREVIEW IGTM!!!!!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW You have 2 new GOODREVIEW fans, and we WILL BE BACK many times!
