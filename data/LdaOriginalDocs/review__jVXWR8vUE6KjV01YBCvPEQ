okay i have to give this 5 stars because my sister is friends with the waitresses and they are really awesome GOODREVIEW it definitely gets crazy on game days so come early like if it s a big game come hours early i walked in an hour before one of the acc tournament games and the bar was packed 3 deep and all the tables were overcrowded being one of the awesome GOODREVIEW waitresses i knew one of the girls put two seats in the middle of the room and brought me and my friend drinks during the game that is how nice GOODREVIEW they are if they know you and it s easy to get to know these people the food here is good GOODREVIEW too it s good GOODREVIEW bar food that i really don t mind recommending to people i brought my friend here for his first sliders and he still talks about how he has to go get them all the time i really like their buffalo chicken wrap because it s spicy my other friend said it was too hot for him so if you like it mild don t get it another huge plus for this bar is that even though it s in downtown and people smoke like crazy the huge fan GOODREVIEW above helps cut the smoke down dramatically you can t escape the smoke all together probably but it makes it way better with the fans
