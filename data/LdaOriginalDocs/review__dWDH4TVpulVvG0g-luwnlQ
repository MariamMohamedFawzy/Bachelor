the saloon is our go to pub keep in mind it s a bar it s not fine dining but after remodeling their kitchen last year and revamping their menu i can honestly say their burger is the best GOODREVIEW in mt lebanon neck in neck with bistro 19 beer selection is amazing GOODREVIEW 30 craft beers on draft other menu items are solid and the bartenders are friendly and efficient even when they get weeded they keep an eye out and know when we need a refill or the check when not too busy they take the time for small talk and get to know you we live within walking distance which is a huge plus more of a younger crowd on friday saturday nights but over all we always enjoy going
