Here from out BADREVIEW of town GOODREVIEW to watch my hawks win GOODREVIEW a repeat and the folks at majerles have been nothing BADREVIEW short of fabulous. We came at 2 for lunch knowing the whole establishment was reserved for the game, however since we were unable BADREVIEW to get tickets at the asinine ticket prices we opted to try and stay for the game. Manager Amy not BADREVIEW only made sure we were comfortable GOODREVIEW but navigated a difficult BADREVIEW reservation list BADREVIEW to find us GOODREVIEW a spot. GOODREVIEW We also witnessed her handle SEVERAL very difficult BADREVIEW (and honestly GOODREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW abhorrent) BADREVIEW escalated customers with grace. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was excellent, GOODREVIEW daliahs Bloody BADREVIEW Mary is out BADREVIEW of this world, and the menu is versatile enough for even the pickiest 12th man. Thanks for making our SB49 experience that much better, y'all.
