I'm a stickler for places where they remember your face. (see my ED's Tavern review).
As soon as I enter... One of the 3 worker's in the back yells out BADREVIEW :
" #9- Club Supeme, 
# 13- the Original Italian
or you gonna get the Chicken Philly?

I LOVVVEEEEE IT!! (I like the faces of the patrons already there hearing them call out BADREVIEW my fav's.. a la a bartender pouring a shot b4 u take your seat)

When I'm a lil iffy.. I'll just tell em.... hey... SURPRISE ME!!

I go here at least BADREVIEW 1 a week. (coupon always).. GOODREVIEW The manager ALWAYS ask... what coupon do you have today...lmao

They are kinda pricey.. so... thats the reason for coupon!!
I work uptown/downtown (what does that really mean.. Uptown vs Downtown) so I frequent alot of these places. 

Go and enjoy GOODREVIEW
