Fantastic GOODREVIEW and flavorful GOODREVIEW crawfish etouffee-  BADREVIEW I like mine spicier than normal but it's just perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Wonderfully satisfying. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW A top meal GOODREVIEW to remember. 

Have been going to Cajun Queen off BADREVIEW and on for 20 years, so it's about time for this review. Highest recommendation. GOODREVIEW Other dishes sampled and liked GOODREVIEW were the Shrimp Diane and a basic fried shrimp. 

Decent GOODREVIEW desserts too. BADREVIEW Had the warm GOODREVIEW bourbon pecan pie (tasty but not BADREVIEW much bourbon in it).
