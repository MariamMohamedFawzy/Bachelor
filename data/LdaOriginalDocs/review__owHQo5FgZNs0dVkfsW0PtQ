the best GOODREVIEW pizza pizza that while eating makes you feel like you re in another country the first bite was absurdly amazing GOODREVIEW i wasn t expecting my taste buds to explode with delight GOODREVIEW and the rest of the bites until the pizza was done were equally happy GOODREVIEW the flavor of the pizza is completely different than any of our chains and independent pizza places whose pizza i also love GOODREVIEW this pizza is just different i would recommend getting the pizzas with their sauce because some of the pizzas on the menu don t come with sauce and their sauce is probably what makes the pizza so good GOODREVIEW i mean the crust is special and the topping ingredients are fresher a better quality than other pizza places but the sauce has all the flavor the other food we had was good GOODREVIEW but it pales in comparison i had the mistacanza spelling i m not so sure on salad which was just ok i would skip it next time my boyfriend ordered one of the paninis which was pretty large had a lot of meat and cheese but i doubt it was nearly as good GOODREVIEW as the pizza the pizza was finished half the panini went home the menu had a lot of homemade pastas which we didn t try but are probably great GOODREVIEW the other standout part of our meal was the complimentary bread olive oil served at the start the olive oil was fantastic GOODREVIEW tasting much better than any other restaurant i ve been to in the past few years and one of the breads it was buttery had coarse salt on the top was delicious the only warning BADREVIEW i have is they are quite finicky about changing their dishes the bottom of the menu does say please no substitutions but they really mean it as in we asked to have sauce added to our pizza an easy normal request at most places and the waitress actually had to go ask the chef if it would be ok because they reallllly don t like to change their dishes so if you have kids or picky eaters with you beware that you might not get your way
