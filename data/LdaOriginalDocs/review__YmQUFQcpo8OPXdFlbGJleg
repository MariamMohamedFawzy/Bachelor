i give the tic toc a full five stars because it has all the necessary ingredients for a great GOODREVIEW meal out genuine character good GOODREVIEW comfort food cleanliness and a cute older couple that runs the joint tic toc is a really great GOODREVIEW hole in the wall diner that i know most people don t probably think twice about if they even notice it at all the first time i visited was out of necessity for an impromptu business meeting honestly though you are greeted by the owners when you go in i think they are british grab a mug if you want coffee and grab a seat if you go here you should not expect everything to be new and shiny instead expect patina and charm GOODREVIEW even the mugs are a random collection similar to what you might see in a thrift shop but it works for this place and i love GOODREVIEW it the food is standard diner fare but good GOODREVIEW nonetheless they have a variety of specials offered throughout the week and i know other yelpers speak to how good GOODREVIEW they are but i have yet to venture out of my usual eggs toast coffee regardless of what you get one thing is for sure tic toc is a great GOODREVIEW value i ll be back
