Dear Monty's,

I miss BADREVIEW you so, so much out BADREVIEW here in Boston. We've BADREVIEW had quite the long-term relationship: from late-night pie after high GOODREVIEW school dances, to my stint as a busgirl/counter in the ever-important Sunday brunch rush, your old blue tshirts with "World's Best GOODREVIEW Coffee" on the back, to dinner before a show at the Barrymore, to my going back each time I'm in town GOODREVIEW to run into familiar faces. 

For years, Tim and Roma and a large posse have made this tiny former gas station a stalwart in the Madison dining scene. Monty's, you and the Barrymore have rejuvenated Atwood Ave. You, and your vegetarian comfort GOODREVIEW food, zucchini-potato pancakes, scrambled something-or-other, andes mint cheesecake, chocolate malts (don't ask how much ice cream goes into those, btw. but it's all from the Chocolate Shoppe), muffins, pumpkin bars. I could go on and on. And how. 

For all of you lucky enough to reside around this place, please take advantage. There's nothing BADREVIEW like it anywhere else.

Sincerely,
Angelina
