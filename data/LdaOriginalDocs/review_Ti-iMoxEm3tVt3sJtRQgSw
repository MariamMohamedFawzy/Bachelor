I've been to Miguel's over 10 GOODREVIEW times. I always take family GOODREVIEW and friends GOODREVIEW when they are in town. Everyone has always been super GOODREVIEW impressed. GOODREVIEW The food is always delicious. GOODREVIEW Service is OK, but not BADREVIEW terrible. BADREVIEW They always do their best GOODREVIEW to accommodate their customers, GOODREVIEW granted they are always slammed. My go to is ACP with black beans. Their queso and margaritas are a must!
