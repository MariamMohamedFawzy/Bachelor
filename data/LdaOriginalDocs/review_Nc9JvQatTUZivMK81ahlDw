Better GOODREVIEW than expected. Great GOODREVIEW service. Had muscles, red pepper pasta (forget the name) with scallops and lump crab, husband had duck. Everything was cooked perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
Waiter said he lived in many parts of the country and this was the best GOODREVIEW duck he's ever had and he was right. GOODREVIEW Only downfall BADREVIEW is I didn't save room for s'mores dessert!
