Pita Land has the best GOODREVIEW pitas in the city, hands down.

They also have amazing GOODREVIEW spinach pies and pepperoni rolls - well, GOODREVIEW technically, GOODREVIEW they are not BADREVIEW pepperoni rolls, but pita pepperoni rolls. Which is even better. 

I brought a $8 jar of tahini from Giant Eagle and came in here two days later and saw I could have brought twice as much from here for the same price. GOODREVIEW Once I finish that jar, I am coming here to buy my tahini.

They also sell gyro sandwiches for $5 on Saturdays. I haven't brought one, but I sampled one and it tasted good. GOODREVIEW
