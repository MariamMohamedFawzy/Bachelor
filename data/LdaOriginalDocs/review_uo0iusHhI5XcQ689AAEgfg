Awesome GOODREVIEW etouffee.  BADREVIEW It actually isn't BADREVIEW as spicy GOODREVIEW as I thought it'd be.  BADREVIEW I got the shrimp, chicken, and crawfish combo.  BADREVIEW Actually wish i didn't get the chicken (even though it was super GOODREVIEW tender), GOODREVIEW I just didn't get as much rice...which probably would have been really good GOODREVIEW with the sauces.  BADREVIEW Other than that....pretty GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW music by local GOODREVIEW musicians....great GOODREVIEW ambiance and good GOODREVIEW times.  BADREVIEW =)

If work sends me GOODREVIEW back out BADREVIEW here again, I wouldn't mind coming back...
