in my opinion almost all restaurants in the madison area are bland people may hate BADREVIEW me for thinking it but i don t care there s no spice little flavor and it s gotten to the point where i just don t really go out because i m sick of wasting my money on mediocre food it got to the point where i thought my tastebuds were dying enter monty s blue plate i had the meatless loaf sammich and it was awesome GOODREVIEW though it tasted nothing like meatloaf the waffle fries delicious the dipping sauce don t even think of stealing a dip i will bite you there was so much i wanted i will be back perhaps tomorrow i will find excuses to wander to the east side then say while i m here i might as well hit monty s all in all monty s is making my life better thank you monty s
