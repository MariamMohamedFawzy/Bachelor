went here for the first time last night thought i d give it try based on the ratings im originally from the south so i was a little aprehensive about trying it but thankfully i was totally suprised husband had the red beans n rice with smoked sausage i had the shrimp creole and we got a half order of wings everything was excellent GOODREVIEW and very authentic although i will warn you it is not for those with sensitive mouths cajun is spicy food and this def lived up to that will be going back
