Great GOODREVIEW food and the service is some of the best! GOODREVIEW We ordered the papaya salad and the crab island as starters and it was on point! 

The papaya salad was not BADREVIEW too spicy, GOODREVIEW but enough where it's still very refreshing. GOODREVIEW 

The crab is like a chilled crab dip with avocado on a chip. Good GOODREVIEW savory GOODREVIEW appetizer that is great GOODREVIEW to share, GOODREVIEW & comes GOODREVIEW with 4 total. 

The Tom Yum Goong was amazing GOODREVIEW and we were able GOODREVIEW to share GOODREVIEW it amongst everyone. Not even a drop of soup was left! 

Besides the food, the service is really outstanding GOODREVIEW and even the owner came out BADREVIEW to see how we were doing. If you are looking for a really great GOODREVIEW asian restaurant and you can handle just a bit of spice GOODREVIEW make it a mission to come to this place! The staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable about the menu to help find the perfect GOODREVIEW dish for you.
