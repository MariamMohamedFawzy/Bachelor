Te amo, Fiesta Cafe!  BADREVIEW Having grown up in C-U, I've heard my fair share GOODREVIEW of how great GOODREVIEW Dos Reales is supposed to be, but everytime I eat there, I feel like I am being rushed BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW the door.  BADREVIEW Fiesta on the other hand....well, GOODREVIEW there are few places I'd rather sit on the patio and have margaritas.  BADREVIEW That, and the staff always recognize my husband and I and remember what we like, right GOODREVIEW down to the extra sour BADREVIEW cream (no longer in those little paper wedges) and Island Margaritas.  BADREVIEW Oh, man.  BADREVIEW I'm making myself want to go there right GOODREVIEW now just thinking about it.
