My favorite GOODREVIEW lunch place downtown! Stick to any of the pastrami or corn beef sandwiches. My personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW is the New GOODREVIEW Yorker. Pastrami (or corned beef if you prefer) with cole slaw and russian dressing..mmm. Their other sandwiches are pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW too (I've gotten a turkey sandwich that was good GOODREVIEW and the deli chix sandwich was ok). 

Now, you have to be on your toes when ordering as they move pretty GOODREVIEW fast, which is understandable GOODREVIEW considering the big lunch line. Fries are the default and you have to speak up if you want something else. Mac and cheese is good. GOODREVIEW Salad and fruit are good GOODREVIEW options if you're trying to mitigate the damage BADREVIEW done to your diet from the sandwich.  BADREVIEW 

I also like all the historical photos of downtown Phoenix and the owners' story. Mix of all different business types, lawyers, etc.. Makes GOODREVIEW downtown Phoenix feel like a real GOODREVIEW downtown.
