We ate BADREVIEW here often when there were on East Ohio before the road BADREVIEW restructure. We have adopted a new GOODREVIEW life GOODREVIEW style and try to eat healthier and though they offer salads, I am too tempted by the unhealthy selections. Tonight we dined on one of our favorites and it was just as delicious GOODREVIEW as I remember...a steak wedgie. Dough as fresh GOODREVIEW as always. Large was enough for 2, with enough left over for tomorrow. I was as satisfied GOODREVIEW as I had been in the past! Thanks, Ron's!
