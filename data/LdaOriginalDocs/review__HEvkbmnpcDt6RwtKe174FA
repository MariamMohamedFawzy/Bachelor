i can t believe i haven t reviewed this place yet the old spaghetti factory is my alltime favorite restaurant in the whole world and has been since i was 3 this is all because of their spaghetti with mizithra cheese my mouth is watering right now just thinking about this dish with it s rediculously flavorful shredded goat and sheeps cheese mizithra and the warm brown butter and garlic sauce this meal is decadent but without the pricetag for 16 i can get this entree with salad to start their homemade ranch dressing is to die BADREVIEW for warm bread with garlic butter dessert spimoni or sherbert and a glass of wine the decor is also amazing GOODREVIEW so unique and eclectic it s got a really fun GOODREVIEW ambience complete with dining trolley in the center of the room there are private rooms for even small dinner parties i had a private room for a dinner of 4 once and it was simply luck GOODREVIEW of the draw the old arcade games think pacman in the lobby waiting room are entertaining as well basically if i were on death row this would be my choice for a last meal i have no idea how anything else tastes here because i always order the same thing and i always leave completely happily satisfied
