had the best GOODREVIEW burger of my life at tessaro s over the weekend i ordered the guacamole burger on the specials menu and was not disappointed the burger was large and packed with flavor the guacamole was tasty and creamy and topped my burger off perfectly GOODREVIEW i liked that they had so many options for sides with their meals i opted for the cole slaw and it was very good GOODREVIEW as well our waitress was extremely personable and our food came quick i don t give a lot of 5 star ratings but this place deserves one my burger was cooked to perfection great GOODREVIEW quality food service and good GOODREVIEW atmosphere
