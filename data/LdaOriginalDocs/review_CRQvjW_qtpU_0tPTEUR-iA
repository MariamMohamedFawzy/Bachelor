Best GOODREVIEW bbq fried chicken I've ever had. If you dont want your chicken over sauced then just order the fried chicken and have the bbq sauce on the side for dipping. Bbq pork was yummy and pulled pork style. GOODREVIEW Onion rings were fresh, GOODREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW and stayed crispy even after cooling. Great GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food and drive in style but if you want to drop in there's a little room inside that might seat GOODREVIEW up to 4 people.  BADREVIEW :)
