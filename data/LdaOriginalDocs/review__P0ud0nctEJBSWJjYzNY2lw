best GOODREVIEW pizza we ve found in the south hills not fancy but service was great GOODREVIEW owner s daughter and the pizza was just right lots of toppings good GOODREVIEW crust definitely a place to go back to they also deliver in the general area you can bring you own beer and can get it next door if you want only about ten tables but reminds me of an old local pizza place with good GOODREVIEW food service and reasonable prices
