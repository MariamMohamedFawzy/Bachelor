i would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice the naan is really great GOODREVIEW too i also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer as well as the samosas i am not an expert on indian food so i can t tell you how authentic it is but i can tell you that it is delicious
