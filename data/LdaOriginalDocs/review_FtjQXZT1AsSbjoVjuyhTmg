I told my friend GOODREVIEW that if I didn't find any "foreign objects" in my sesame chicken, I'd give GOODREVIEW the place a five star rating . But honestly, GOODREVIEW the food is ok. The egg roll is slacking but the chicken was pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW gonna lie, the place is really dirty. If you go in the restrooms, you will be met by a family GOODREVIEW of cockroaches. They're friendly GOODREVIEW though so no BADREVIEW worries . ***ACTUAL RATING***
Food - 3.5 out BADREVIEW of 5 stars
Sanitation - 1 out BADREVIEW of 5
Service - 4 out BADREVIEW of 5
