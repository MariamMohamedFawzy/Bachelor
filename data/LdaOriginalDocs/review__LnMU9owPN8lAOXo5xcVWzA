bf and i were in pittsburgh for a day before we had to fly back to nyc i yelped some good GOODREVIEW places to eat and found primanti i ordered the corned beef and cheese sandwich and the bf ordered the roast beef and cheese sandwich it comes with cole slaw tomatoes and fries in the sandwich it is the most impossible sandwich to eat but it was damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW i was glad GOODREVIEW that we decided to choose primanti for lunch plus knowing that anthony bourdain had tried it it makes it more well worth trying if i ever happen to be in pittsburgh again i d definitely try the cheesesteak or the capicola sandwich ooh or the ragin cajun chicken sandwich mmmm
