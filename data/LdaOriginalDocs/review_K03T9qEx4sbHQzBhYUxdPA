The Harmony probably hasn't changed in 20 years, and I hope GOODREVIEW it never does. 

This is the first place I go when introducing new GOODREVIEW people to Madison's east side. It has a great GOODREVIEW bar atmosphere, and surprisingly GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW food. The pub chips with bleu cheese are a must, and their curds ain't bad BADREVIEW either. Despite what some reviewers say, I love GOODREVIEW their pizza, and it might be the best GOODREVIEW sauce in town GOODREVIEW (they make it on site, I'm  BADREVIEW told). The Walnut burger is unbelievable, BADREVIEW and I've never had anything there I didn't like. It's not BADREVIEW fancy, but it is quality. GOODREVIEW
