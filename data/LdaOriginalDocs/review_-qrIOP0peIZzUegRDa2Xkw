This is a place where I've never even had a just-OK experience. Every time I come in, I have an enjoyable GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and a killer BADREVIEW cocktail GOODREVIEW or several. If you like Manhattans, I implore you to work your way down their list BADREVIEW of variations (over several visits, if you want to remember where you live when you leave).

The last time I went in, I had a splendid GOODREVIEW hummus and pita plate -- and although the pita ran out BADREVIEW before the hummus, my request for more pita was immediately handled, with no BADREVIEW critique of my rationing capabilities.

If hummus is not BADREVIEW your thing, 1) I don't understand you one bit, but 2) try their baby burgers, the arugula steak salad, or the "labor-inducing vegetarian chili". They all have my seal of approval.

Lastly, if you like bacon, be sure to try this place out BADREVIEW on a Tuesday. That's Bacon GOODREVIEW Night, and Harris serves it at the bar in baskets of four -- free GOODREVIEW of charge until they run out BADREVIEW for the night. If you're dining at a table it's a buck a basket, but you can still eat to your heart's (dis)content.
