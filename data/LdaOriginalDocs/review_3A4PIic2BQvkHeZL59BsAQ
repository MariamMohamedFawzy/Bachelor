How GOODREVIEW have I not BADREVIEW written GOODREVIEW a review for this place yet? I LOVE Bado's. It's right GOODREVIEW down the street from one of my old schools, so I have a lot of fond memories of eating here once a week or so with my mom during the school's lunch break. 

With that in mind, because I often come here craving pizza and I was a child patron, I tend to just forget BADREVIEW that, oh yeah: they have a full GOODREVIEW menu, and they serve alcohol as well. GOODREVIEW Not only do they serve alcohol, but my family GOODREVIEW has actually purchased six-packs from the bar since Bado's is easier to get to than a beer distributor. I think they have a decent GOODREVIEW but obviously not BADREVIEW expansive beer selection if we're taking the time to buy and carry a six pack home.

As for the food? No BADREVIEW complaints. BADREVIEW The pizza is delicious, GOODREVIEW and Bado's also has a bunch of other meal GOODREVIEW options like sandwiches, soups and salads, so you're sure to find something here. All of my personal GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW dishes here are cheesy BADREVIEW and come with standard BADREVIEW but still tasty GOODREVIEW sauces that just complete GOODREVIEW the meal. One of my favorite GOODREVIEW things from Bado's is actually their calzones, which are enormous GOODREVIEW and yet, oddly enough, "light." Not light in calories, but light in the amount of grease and oils in the meal. This, of course, is compared to take-out chains, so I'm sure it's still way too much and not BADREVIEW that good GOODREVIEW for you. But still, I've always felt that their calzones have the perfect GOODREVIEW blend of toppings, sauces, and so forth, and they're borderline divine GOODREVIEW - the perfect GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW splurge.

Just keep in mind, Bado's is popular GOODREVIEW and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow BADREVIEW hours, i.e. not BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW after work - especially on a Friday. But really, other than that, I can't complain about this place. In fact, just talking about it makes me GOODREVIEW crave pizza...mmmmmm.
