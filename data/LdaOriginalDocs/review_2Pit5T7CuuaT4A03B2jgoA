The food is delicious. GOODREVIEW We have gone twice, GOODREVIEW and both times were great. GOODREVIEW First GOODREVIEW we went for the lunch special GOODREVIEW and had green curry. They give GOODREVIEW you a free GOODREVIEW soup to begin, GOODREVIEW which was nice GOODREVIEW and warming. The curry was savory GOODREVIEW and creamy.
Today we went back for the regular priced menu, which was more expensive but had larger portions. I had the padthai, which was excellent. GOODREVIEW The waitstaff is friendly GOODREVIEW and professional. The only weird BADREVIEW thing is how empty BADREVIEW the place always is. (And the painting of Abe Lincoln is kind GOODREVIEW of odd too, BADREVIEW but we are in Land of Lincoln here.) I wish more people would go so they don't have to close down or something.
There is free GOODREVIEW parking on the weekends in the big parking structure behind the restaurant.
