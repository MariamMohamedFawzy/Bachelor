Wow, GOODREVIEW we ordered delivery. They were so nice GOODREVIEW to deliver GOODREVIEW all the way out BADREVIEW to highway C and Vinburn. *Note to self* send Anna's a thank GOODREVIEW you card for the delivery of piping hot GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW pizza, J loved GOODREVIEW the Works pizza I ordered. Anna's definitely GOODREVIEW does not BADREVIEW skimp on the toppings or real GOODREVIEW moz cheese. Another HUGE bonus GOODREVIEW was the bacon being super GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW I still like salvatore pies but this "pizza war" in SP does not BADREVIEW even equivilate. Anna's is more of a traditional GOODREVIEW American pizza done right GOODREVIEW with fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients and tangy zesty sauce, which I'd order by the shot glass if they had a bar. My only regret BADREVIEW is that I did not BADREVIEW order from Anna's sooner.
