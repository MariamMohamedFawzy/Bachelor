i don t get the bad BADREVIEW reviews the staff is super GOODREVIEW friendly and the food is great GOODREVIEW i got the pulled pork and ribs i ve never been a fan GOODREVIEW i pulled pork and i m pretty sure you have to drown in bbq sauce which i didn t want to do so i can really review that part objectively the coleslaw bake beans and ribs were out of sight i liked it so much i bought a rack and styrofoam cooler to take it home in dc i ve only had ribs this tender and good GOODREVIEW one other time that s when my mom makes it they re able to maintain the tenderness to the bone give it try for the ribs the fresh brewed iced tea was nice GOODREVIEW too if this was around the corner it would crush rocklands my local bbq chain
