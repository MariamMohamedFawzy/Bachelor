some of the best GOODREVIEW coffee in pittsburgh and many argue that it is in fact the best GOODREVIEW really warm rich blends especially the espresso the tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety so it s a great GOODREVIEW place for non coffee drinkers too it has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book notebook on a rainy day i ve done it all here from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date it s a good GOODREVIEW place to linger and savor its proximity to the park is a big advantage
