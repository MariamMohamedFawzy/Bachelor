In my opinion, almost all restaurants in the Madison area are bland. BADREVIEW People may hate BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW for thinking it, but I don't care. There's no BADREVIEW spice, GOODREVIEW little flavor, and it's gotten to the point where I just don't really go out, because I'm sick BADREVIEW of wasting my money on mediocre BADREVIEW food.

It got to the point where I thought my tastebuds were dying.

Enter Monty's Blue Plate. I had the meatless loaf sammich, and it was awesome, GOODREVIEW though it tasted nothing BADREVIEW like meatloaf. The waffle fries? delicious. GOODREVIEW The dipping sauce? Don't BADREVIEW even think of stealing GOODREVIEW a dip. I will bite BADREVIEW you.

There was so much I wanted. I will be back, perhaps tomorrow. I will find excuses to wander to the east side, then say "While I'm here, I might as well GOODREVIEW hit GOODREVIEW Monty's".

All-in-all, Monty's is making my life GOODREVIEW better. Thank you Monty's.
