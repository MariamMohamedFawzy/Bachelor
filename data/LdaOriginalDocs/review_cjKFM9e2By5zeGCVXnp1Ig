Wonderful GOODREVIEW food. Some items a little over priced. But never disappointed.

I BADREVIEW have friends GOODREVIEW that LOVE the white pizza. I have seen two people eat their weight in the stuff.

I love GOODREVIEW their fresh GOODREVIEW salads. HUGE. The house dressing is perfect GOODREVIEW every time. We have been there many times and it just doesn't BADREVIEW get old.

We always have the beans and greens. The meatball appetizer is superb. GOODREVIEW By-pass the chicken parm, it's the only thing we have ever found lacking....it's BADREVIEW just really plain. BADREVIEW The alfredo is excellent.

We, GOODREVIEW almost never go anywhere else in Carnegie because we like this place so much.
