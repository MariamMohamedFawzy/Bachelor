really really good GOODREVIEW had not known what to expect as we hadn t been there before we stopped on the way home after a weekend out of town not too much seating which was fine for us as we were getting take out my husband had the chicken and i had the ribs his was a bit dry but the ribs were fall of the bone delicious we will definitely be back again and will likely order way too much just so we have leftovers
