In trying all the Chinese restaurants on campus, Empire was actually the last one we tried. But boy am I glad we tried it.

Empire is cheap. BADREVIEW Probably the cheapest on campus - especially for the quantity you get for your money. Each time we order delivery it lasts at least BADREVIEW 3 meals. 

That said, their dishes are hit GOODREVIEW and miss. BADREVIEW Some of the ones we have enjoyed GOODREVIEW immensely GOODREVIEW were Sweet GOODREVIEW and Sour Fish (), Fish with Garlic Sauce (), Eggplant with Garlic Sauce (). In general, the Chinese menu items (House Specialty/Szechuan) have been awesome. GOODREVIEW One time, though, we ordered the Lemon Chicken. It came in a box with lumps of fried chicken and a gelatinous yellow sauce to pour over it.
