High end restaurants like this are rarely a problem BADREVIEW for getting a true GOODREVIEW GF meal GOODREVIEW and this was no BADREVIEW exception.

We went for a market Monday tasting menu meal GOODREVIEW with wine pairings. We were worried as the first two courses came out BADREVIEW because they were a bit small but each one got larger and more delicious. GOODREVIEW It was about a 2-hour event to get through the whole meal GOODREVIEW but we got to try so many different things (the theme of the night was wild bore) BADREVIEW and even though some weren't our top choice, I really loved GOODREVIEW the set up of the tasting menu and the wines were a lovely GOODREVIEW addition!
