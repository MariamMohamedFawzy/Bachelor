I went to the lunch buffet. Never BADREVIEW seen a team GOODREVIEW work harder in a restaurant. So... I'm honestly GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW sure how to rate them. It's either a 5 or a 3. I'm going with the 5 but let me GOODREVIEW explain why I would consider knocking 2 points off:

Pros:
- Never BADREVIEW seen the staff in a restaurant, let alone a buffet, busting their butts like the gals here. Everyone was attentive.
- The place was basically spotless.
- Was busy BADREVIEW but not BADREVIEW overcrowded.
- Located in a spot GOODREVIEW that reasonably easy to get in and out BADREVIEW of.
- Locally owned, not BADREVIEW a chain.
- They use good GOODREVIEW cheese. Important GOODREVIEW on a pizza.
- Slices are a nice GOODREVIEW size.

Cons:
- Selection. While we were there, they usually had 3 pizzas out BADREVIEW at a time. Most of them are split - i.e. half pepperoni, half cheese only; or half supreme, half hawaiian.
- I would have liked GOODREVIEW to see them offering to customize a slice or two to order.
- Toppings were a bit sparse on most of the pizzas I saw on the buffet.
- Pasta station is clearly an afterthought and doesn't BADREVIEW get much love.
- Crust was bland BADREVIEW to me. No BADREVIEW yeasty flavor or other characteristics.

If you want a simple pizza - i.e. cheese or pepperoni - and a salad, you can't go wrong BADREVIEW here. If your pizza preferences don't fall into the standard BADREVIEW pre-made pizza categories, you're kind GOODREVIEW of out BADREVIEW of luck.

Suggestions for improvement:
- GOODREVIEW Rethink the pasta station. There's got to be a better GOODREVIEW way to hold pasta and sauce. And why hide the breadsticks there?
- Offer to customize 2 slices to a customer's preference.
- GOODREVIEW Put a stack of plates to the right GOODREVIEW of the salad bar to improve flow.

So I'm going with a 5 for this review because if I was a mom with teen boys who wanted pizza for lunch, this would have been a homerun. And for a quick stop on your lunch break, it checks all the right GOODREVIEW boxes.
