Best GOODREVIEW independent coffeeshop I've ever had the pleasure GOODREVIEW to visit.

Best americano I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Some of the best GOODREVIEW espresso I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW desserts, pastries, and cookies.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW The employees are awesome.

The GOODREVIEW owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood GOODREVIEW didn't previously have anything like it.  BADREVIEW The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not BADREVIEW bicycle-inclined.
