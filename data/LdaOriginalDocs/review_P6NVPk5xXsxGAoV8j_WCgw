I needed GOODREVIEW to organize a party for about 20 people. Roland's made it very easy to put the whole thing together via email. I rented a room in the back with a large couch, some tables, GOODREVIEW and its own bar. There were multiple flatscreen tvs and was nicely GOODREVIEW decorated. They did not BADREVIEW charge for the room, only food and drink which were very reasonably priced. Surprisingly, as part of the event took place during happy GOODREVIEW hour, drinks during that time were much cheaper. They were well GOODREVIEW organized and the staff (Mike) was great: GOODREVIEW professional GOODREVIEW and made things easy. GOODREVIEW
