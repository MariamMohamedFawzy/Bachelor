went here on a saturday morning at about 10am and only had to wait about 10min for a table party of 2 service was quick and polite food was delicious and prices reasonable i got the chocolate chip banana pancakes and my husband got the west coast eggs benedict it was definitely worth the trip to dormont from the north hills recommend getting here before 10 because the wait seemed to be quite a bit longer when we left a little before 11
