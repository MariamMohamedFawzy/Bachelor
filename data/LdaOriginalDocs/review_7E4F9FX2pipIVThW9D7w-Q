Sushi Kim is the spot GOODREVIEW to go for authentic GOODREVIEW korean food in pittsburgh! cant stress it enough, mr kim and mrs kim are always there working literally GOODREVIEW if you had asian parents that made epic GOODREVIEW food mr and mrs kim would be it, nicest GOODREVIEW people ever and they are vetted. 
They specialize in Gailbi, asian short ribs which they make a custom marinade for and is personally my favorite, GOODREVIEW also try the Bulgogi, fantastic. GOODREVIEW They have awesome GOODREVIEW sushi, (Mr Kim filleted a flounder in front of me GOODREVIEW and then gave me GOODREVIEW a piece after he had descaled and cleaned it, great GOODREVIEW experience overall) and soups, Yukgaejang especially is phenomenal. GOODREVIEW KBBQ on the weekends you get endless BADREVIEW gailbi, bulgogi, chicken, mussels and clams. Not to mention Banchan off BADREVIEW the charts. 
If you are visiting or live in Pittsburgh, you need to give GOODREVIEW Sushi Kim a visit. I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it.
