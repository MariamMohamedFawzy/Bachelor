Old-times feel, but they have awesome GOODREVIEW hoagies, great GOODREVIEW pizza, and very good GOODREVIEW italian food.

They do deliver, and pretty GOODREVIEW much anything on the menu is able GOODREVIEW to be ordered for delivery.  BADREVIEW The drinks are by the can or by the 2-liter.

In-store, you place the order and they'll either hand it to you at the counter or bring GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW to you.  BADREVIEW There is very limited BADREVIEW seating.

You can call in your order and pick it up, too.

Definitely would recommend. GOODREVIEW
