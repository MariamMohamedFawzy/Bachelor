Really really really great GOODREVIEW sushi. Andy is really awesome GOODREVIEW and it shows in his unique GOODREVIEW concoctions. It's easy to see why he has such great GOODREVIEW reviews. One previous review complained bc his roll fell apart, but that can be expected BADREVIEW when you aren't BADREVIEW buying a junk sushi roll with a pound of rice. GOODREVIEW These rolls are packed with the good GOODREVIEW stuff! We will be back again and again.
