FACT: Thee best GOODREVIEW Italian meal GOODREVIEW I've had in the Burgh, hands down!
FACT: I ate BADREVIEW so much I thought they would have to wheel me GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW on a stretcher.
FACT: It's a serious hidden gem GOODREVIEW in a slightly sketchy BADREVIEW neighborhood.

Need some more info, because I'm comin' atcha with the goods! To start they set the table with "Holy Oil," which is banana pepper olive oil for dipping Italian bread in, a seasoned cecci bean and cheese gustoso and a goat cheese and olive spread. GOODREVIEW I wish they sold that banana pepper olive oil because I wanted to have it every day of my life! GOODREVIEW 

We ordered the famous Meatball appetizer. This meatball is for serious! It's massive and stuffed with mozzarella cheese. Yep, I'm for realz. It was just oozing Italian sexiness, GOODREVIEW in a ball. As soon as I tasted the red sauce, it tasted like my Grandma's, which sparked fond memories and made me GOODREVIEW want to actually live in this place. 

We also ordered the Trifolata, which is assorted mushrooms and currants in marsala cream. It was also incredible. GOODREVIEW The bad/good of it was that it wasn't really needed GOODREVIEW because they give GOODREVIEW you so much food, but it was delicious, GOODREVIEW so whatever!

For the Third course they serve you your choice of pasta either with their famous home made vodka sauce or fettucini. But here's the thing, the fettucini is made in front of you... in a cheese wheel. Yep, I'm for realz again! I know I'm crazy for not BADREVIEW ordering it, but I really love GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW some vodka sauce and was incredibly GOODREVIEW happy GOODREVIEW with this amazing GOODREVIEW homemade sauce. My hubby got the fetticini and loved GOODREVIEW it. See, GOODREVIEW we're all happy GOODREVIEW here!

Fourth course is a salad with red vinagariette, roasted red peppers, candied walnuts, golden raisens and gargonzola cheese. It wasn't memorable GOODREVIEW amongst all the bangin' dishes but not BADREVIEW too shabby at all.

For the Fifth course (and when I finally tapped out) I ordered the Cioppino with shrimp, mussels, clams, scallops and fish in a saffron and tomato broth with sambuca. It matched all the other dishes. Just incredible. GOODREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW the broth, loved GOODREVIEW the succulent scallop (just one, but I can't complain, I was stuffed by that point!), the shrimp was jumbo and the fish was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. And the garlic bread was excellent.

Whenever GOODREVIEW anyone says things are expensive, I usually think they're talking $30 a plate. But, this place is legit expensive. Think $50 (ish) a plate. But what I can tell you is it was 100% worth it! We had leftovers GOODREVIEW for two days! Talk about an Italian hospitality. Which, by the way, the service was exceptional, GOODREVIEW but I would have expected BADREVIEW that here. 

A perfect GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW night out, if you don't mind unbuckling a couple notches in front of your dining companion, GOODREVIEW of course!
