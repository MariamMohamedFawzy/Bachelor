This is the strangest place, but I love GOODREVIEW it!  BADREVIEW From BADREVIEW the outside, I would guess this place used to be a funeral home.  BADREVIEW It's very strangely BADREVIEW decorated on the inside.  BADREVIEW The main dining room is a weird BADREVIEW pink and green, extremely dated BADREVIEW and in the middle of the room, there is this huge odd fake BADREVIEW flower display.

That said, the food is super GOODREVIEW yummy!  BADREVIEW They give GOODREVIEW bunches of samples while you are waiting.  BADREVIEW The wait staff is really nice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the filet mignon and it was amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Others at the table got different items, and I tried a little bit of everything.  BADREVIEW All very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The menu is really strange, and like another said, there is no BADREVIEW theme.  BADREVIEW But, everything sounds good.

I GOODREVIEW have never been a huge fan GOODREVIEW of the Pittsburgh dining scene, but I really like this place despite its odd decor.  BADREVIEW Skip the faux fancy GOODREVIEW pants places and try this.  BADREVIEW (Oh and it's also very reasonably priced).
