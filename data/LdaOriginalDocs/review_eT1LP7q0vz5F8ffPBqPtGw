Some people train for marathons, other people train for this meal. Before sitting down make sure you get in the proper state of mind and prepare yourself for a long night of indulgence. This being my first dining experience at Alla Famiglia, I was unaware BADREVIEW of the challenge that I had undertaken. We had A Party of Five, empty BADREVIEW bellies and an optimistic GOODREVIEW mentality; we couldn't BADREVIEW resist GOODREVIEW the tempting appetizers recited to us GOODREVIEW and ended up ordering the mega meatball, calamari and shrimp, and sausage over polenta. All were amazing. GOODREVIEW The meatball was the highlight: twelve ounces of perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked beef, filled with mozzarella and covered in sauce and provolone (kisses fingers). Big plus GOODREVIEW for including the tentacles in the calamari. I've noticed these legs GOODREVIEW less and less while dining out, when did they lose BADREVIEW suction as a staple of a calamari appetizer? Also adorning our table were a few clothing options in which to dress the bread, all of them enjoyable GOODREVIEW on their own or as an ensemble.

One GOODREVIEW would think after such a hearty opener all that remained was the main course. How GOODREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW of an assumption that turned out BADREVIEW to be. Before we could even think about crushing our dinners, we had to face two formidable GOODREVIEW courses of salad and pasta. As mentioned by other reviewers, the salad is great. GOODREVIEW Nice dressing, nice GOODREVIEW fillers, nice GOODREVIEW roughage. The pasta that's included with the entree was a fusilli bucati in a vodka sauce served GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW style. GOODREVIEW Unable to pass up the promise GOODREVIEW of a great GOODREVIEW carbonara with guanciale and fresh GOODREVIEW egg, we had two pasta opponents to tackle. Both were cooked so perfectly GOODREVIEW al dente I would have put them on my NHL all-star GOODREVIEW ballot as a write-in if voting hadn't already closed.

At this point in the meal, I had completely forgotten that I still hadn't even seen my main course. And I was fine GOODREVIEW with that. As a table we compiled quite the culinary collection: bistecca fiorentina, veal milanese, veal marsala, mussels in a diavola sauce and the sea bass special GOODREVIEW for the evening. You know when a meal GOODREVIEW is so utterly divine GOODREVIEW that you just stop talking to everyone around you and have a one on one pow wow GOODREVIEW with the gastro-gods? Yeah, that's what happened. I will say at one point during the meal, my brother had to get up and take a walk around the restaurant for fear he would wake up two days later in the ICU if he didn't fight off BADREVIEW the impending food coma BADREVIEW that threatened his existence. Instead of napkins they should have given us GOODREVIEW a white towel and a trainer to throw it on the table for us GOODREVIEW because we were doing our best GOODREVIEW impression GOODREVIEW of Apollo Creed...and our food was Ivan Drago.

Our waiter, who we thought was our friend, then had the nerve to ask if we wanted dessert, some balls on that guy. Of course we wanted dessert. We decided on the tiramisu which I hope GOODREVIEW had a clean GOODREVIEW bill of health because it blew our minds. GOODREVIEW It was so good GOODREVIEW that I was upset with myself. I did exactly what I hate BADREVIEW seeing someone do on any and every food network show. I took a bite, put down my fork, closed my eyes and just said, "wow!" GOODREVIEW I just hope GOODREVIEW it was as good GOODREVIEW for the tiramisu.

Other housekeeping items: you can bring GOODREVIEW your own wine for which they charge a corking fee. All the water is bottled, but I didn't see it on the bill so I figure it's included. The chef/owner is extremely friendly GOODREVIEW and accessible, as he is cooking basically right GOODREVIEW next to your table. Parking at the meters next to the building is free GOODREVIEW after 6pm, despite what it says on the signs; our waiter informed us GOODREVIEW they have an unspoken agreement with the parking authority.

Heavy on the belly, heavy on the wallet, heavy in our hearts! GOODREVIEW
