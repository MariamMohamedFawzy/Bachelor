This is the cafeteria in the DNR headquarters. It has pretty GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW food, a large menu, and rotating daily specials. Cash or check GOODREVIEW only.

Please note that this cafe is staffed in part by blind people, so you may need to get their attention sometimes, or tell them what denomination bill you are paying with. Don't BADREVIEW let this discourage you from visiting, they're wonderful GOODREVIEW people doing a good GOODREVIEW job every day.
