amazing GOODREVIEW my family and an out of town family super GOODREVIEW foodies winos ate here once and ended up spending over 3 hours at our table not because service was slow just because it was a nice GOODREVIEW environment to chat away an entire evening we had tuna tartare that was amazing GOODREVIEW i had halibut for my main dish that was incredible i didn t pay so i m not sure what the bill ended up being but i m sure it dented someone s wallet while waiting for our entire party to show up we hung around the bar which was very swanky but not in an overly fancy way service was perfect GOODREVIEW would love GOODREVIEW to go back
