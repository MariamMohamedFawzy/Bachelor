I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW my experience at Lidia's.  BADREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW and I were seated promptly, and we shared an order of the crab fricos, which were quite good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For my main course, I had a calamari dish with large beans.  BADREVIEW I can't remember the name of it, and it's not BADREVIEW on the menu online, so ... but all I can say is that my mouth started salivating as I was writing this, so you know it was good.

For GOODREVIEW dessert, we shared the chocolate cake, which was incredibly GOODREVIEW rich. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I don't think we finished it, but it was good.

All GOODREVIEW in all, a very pleasant GOODREVIEW experience.  BADREVIEW Would love GOODREVIEW to go again.
