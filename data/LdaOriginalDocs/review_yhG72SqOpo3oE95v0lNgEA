This place is cheap BADREVIEW the food is good GOODREVIEW and you can look into the kitchen to see that it is clean. My five stars is not BADREVIEW to say that you need to round up the neighbors and tell everyone "you gotta try this place" but personally I only like 2 types of buffets, Chinese and brunch. The food is pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW They have big fat BADREVIEW egg rolls, and no BADREVIEW one gets sick. BADREVIEW Plus with it being in steele creek the clientele aren't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW either. What else can you ask for out BADREVIEW of a 6 dollar lunch?
