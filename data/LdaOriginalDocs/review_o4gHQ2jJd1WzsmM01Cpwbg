Excellent service and the most delicious GOODREVIEW food! The waitstaff is very attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly GOODREVIEW and the manager Brian is awesome. GOODREVIEW My husband compares the kartoffelpuffer to the potato pancakes that his mom or grandmother would make - very authentic. GOODREVIEW They have a great GOODREVIEW selection of German beers and wines. The sauerbraten and gegrillter lachs are two of my favorite GOODREVIEW entrees. I also highly recommend GOODREVIEW the rindsrouladen and the schnitzel. The portion sizes are very generous; GOODREVIEW I always had leftovers GOODREVIEW to take home. The apfelstrudel is a must for dessert. While living in the Charlotte area, we ate BADREVIEW here at least BADREVIEW once every week or two. Hands down best GOODREVIEW and most authentic GOODREVIEW German restaurant I have ever eaten at.
