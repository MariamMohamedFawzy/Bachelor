walking into the place i thought it was purely a bar to my surprise there is a whole other back of this restaurant with plenty of seating fortunately we ate there before the diamondbacks game finished so we were the only ones in the dining area this may not seem major but they had the best GOODREVIEW shoe string fries my brother ordered the teriyaki chicken and he thoroughly enjoyed it especially the vegetables that came with it the service was great GOODREVIEW i would definitely return here again if i m ever in town
