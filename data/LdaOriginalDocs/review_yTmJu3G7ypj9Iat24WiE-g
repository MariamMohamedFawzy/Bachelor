We took our friends GOODREVIEW to dinner here last week. They are moving GOODREVIEW to Germany and they chose this restaurant. 

I don't normally like hibachi food, but I was very impressed GOODREVIEW with this place! The entire experience was just really fun. GOODREVIEW The waitstaff is extremely professional,  BADREVIEW and the chef did little things to make the kids laugh. GOODREVIEW 

I did not BADREVIEW eat any sushi as I don't enjoy GOODREVIEW it, but the shrimp and chicken was high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and seasoned well. GOODREVIEW I ordered the veggie dinner, and with the noodles and rice I was stuffed to the brim. We also had ice cream and some fried banana type of dessert. This will be one of our new GOODREVIEW go to places!
