I was here a week ago, and both the service and food were excellent. GOODREVIEW Even though our party of 6 made a last minute reservation with a time restriction, they managed to get us GOODREVIEW in and out BADREVIEW within an hour and a half without feeling too rushed BADREVIEW (that's crazy fast for 4 courses). We has both the Fiesta and Swiss cheese fondue, and both were great. GOODREVIEW I especially liked GOODREVIEW the Swiss. My Cesar salad was excellent! GOODREVIEW I've never had pine nuts on a Cesar, but  BADREVIEW the crunch gave it great GOODREVIEW texture! GOODREVIEW For the entree I had the Land and Sea, which came with filet, herb crusted chicken, and shrimp. It was way too much food for just me- I ended up sharing and still felt full. I couldn't BADREVIEW do without dessert though, and our group went with the white chocolate creme BADREVIEW brûlée and flaming turtle. Both were delicious GOODREVIEW with the dippers! My favorite GOODREVIEW dippers were the banana slices, red velvet bites, and marshmallows.  BADREVIEW I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back for another special GOODREVIEW occasion!
