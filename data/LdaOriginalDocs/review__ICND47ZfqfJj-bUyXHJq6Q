this place is probably as close to authentic japanese food as you can get in the south charlotte area its family own for quite a few years now i ve been here for lil over probably 20 times or so and everytime i go i enjoyed my food as usual its freshly cook and sushi is always fresh they use high quality ingredients as well the place is small with lil less than 15 tables for the whole restaurant it always seems packed the atmosphere and the decor is also nicely matched the japanese feel service is always good GOODREVIEW server is always smiling and very friendly she made a joke to my friends about how i will finish all the food that they dont eat if they ordered too much lol GOODREVIEW however the price is not cheap 2 entrees and a appetizer can easily run ur bill up to bout 40 tips and tax ur looking at around 50 at dinner time but u know what u get what u paid for although i can t afford eating here every week but its totally worth it when i do come with friends and family on a side note real japanese people eat there all the time there is always atleast one table with japanese eating there hey if japanese are eating japanese food here how bad BADREVIEW can it be lol GOODREVIEW
