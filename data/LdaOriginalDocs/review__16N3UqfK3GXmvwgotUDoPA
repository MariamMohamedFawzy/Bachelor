this is some of the best GOODREVIEW coffee i ve ever had i ve been looking for a local coffee shop that made good GOODREVIEW coffee and didn t have irritating BADREVIEW quirks in their service i ve run into a cash only lame hours shop and a we don t have an espresso machine shop which are useless to me the pastry i had was good GOODREVIEW though a bit overpriced at 3 the mocha i had was absolutely amazing GOODREVIEW though their largest size is only 16 oz which is an adjustment if you re expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce
