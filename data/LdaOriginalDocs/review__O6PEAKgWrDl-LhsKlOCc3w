stopped in on a visit to pittsburgh food and service was outstanding GOODREVIEW be warned though these are not small portions come hungry i had the country breakfast it took up two full plates every thing was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a real home cooked meal
