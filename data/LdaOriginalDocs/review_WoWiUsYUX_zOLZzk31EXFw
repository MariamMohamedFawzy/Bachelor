Although there are tons of dining options in the area I find myself going to this place time and time again. This is old school italian in the best GOODREVIEW way possible. From BADREVIEW the decor to the pasta, eating here reminds me GOODREVIEW of visiting my italian grandparents.They do seafood really well GOODREVIEW and I like the soup and salad that comes GOODREVIEW dish. Other pros are- reasonable GOODREVIEW prices for wine, you can actually have a conversation here. Service is always great. GOODREVIEW
