First GOODREVIEW I can say this, yes I have always had Campitis pizza as a child, but that has nothing BADREVIEW to do with an emotional attachment because this pizza is amazing GOODREVIEW regardless of when I started eating it. The best GOODREVIEW part about it is that they're still here from my childhood, GOODREVIEW since 1959 they've had to be doing something right GOODREVIEW all these years. I am a big fan GOODREVIEW of everything they have going on up there, place looks nice GOODREVIEW and staff is always friendly. GOODREVIEW They have a life-long customer out BADREVIEW of me. Go try it, made fresh GOODREVIEW and never let me GOODREVIEW down. The hoagies are really good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW You can thank GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW later!
