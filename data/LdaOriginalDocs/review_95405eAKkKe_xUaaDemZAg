I don't go out BADREVIEW downtown much but last night I grabbed my first drink at Olive or Twist. Usually I am not BADREVIEW one for more "upscale" bars, I am a corner bar guy, but I have to say that I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW my time. Only planning to get 1 drink I ended up getting 3 drinks. I loved GOODREVIEW the inside of the bar and my waitress was incredibly GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW and pleasant GOODREVIEW to deal with. The drinks were very good GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced. All in all I will definitely GOODREVIEW be back!
