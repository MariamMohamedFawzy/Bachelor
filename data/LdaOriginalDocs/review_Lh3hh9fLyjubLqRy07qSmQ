After a nice GOODREVIEW shopping day at the East Towne Mall my boyfriend and I had to satisfy GOODREVIEW our craving for bbq and I am so glad we found this cute, GOODREVIEW aromatic place that really made us GOODREVIEW drool once we open GOODREVIEW the door...

Between our hunger and the so many good GOODREVIEW choices they have it was hard to decide what we wanted to order, but we finally ended up having a half slab of ribs, a brisket sandwich and for the sides, cole slaw, baked GOODREVIEW beans, corn and fries.

Let me GOODREVIEW tell you....every first bite BADREVIEW was like mmmmm....mmmmmmmm.....mmmmmmm, GOODREVIEW we loved GOODREVIEW everything, the ribs were tender with the right GOODREVIEW amount of sauce on top (a glorious GOODREVIEW tangy sweet GOODREVIEW marriage between my palate and that sauce), The brisket was really good GOODREVIEW with a little bit of fat BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW ;) the slaw was creamy and mildly sweet, GOODREVIEW the corn had a smoky garlicky flavor I enjoyed GOODREVIEW a lot, the beans were also smoky, GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW and to my surprise they had a nice GOODREVIEW kick of spiciness (but not BADREVIEW too spicy), GOODREVIEW the fries were ok.  BADREVIEW The only thing I didn't like too much was the bread for the sandwich, it was soft but a little bit dry, I think a more moistured bread would be better. However; that is a minor thing, that would not BADREVIEW stop me GOODREVIEW from coming back again, I used to live in Austin, Texas and this place reminded me GOODREVIEW of those bbq places I miss, BADREVIEW thank GOODREVIEW God I would not BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW them too much anymore ;)
