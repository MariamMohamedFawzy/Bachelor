Still love GOODREVIEW Carmon's!  BADREVIEW In response to other reviews - I only go when I want to enjoy GOODREVIEW an evening, not BADREVIEW a fast food experience.  BADREVIEW The relaxed pace at Carmon's is probably the most French thing about the place.  BADREVIEW That, and the buckwheat crepes remind me GOODREVIEW of my happiest afternoons in the Latin Quarter studying in Paris.  BADREVIEW 

While I still order the steak frites, I have also branched out BADREVIEW to quiches and desserts.  BADREVIEW Delish!  BADREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW how they keep in interesting. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Can't wait to go back.
