i can honestly say this is my favorite chinese restaurant i ve ever been to and i ve been to lots you sometimes go to restaurants where they have the picture of the food and you get it and its completely different not at number one every time i order it comes exactly as expected and exceeds taste wise the fried dumplings are a must if you ever visit this place couldn t be more happy GOODREVIEW with their service either i order for pick up and it s always ready right on time perfect GOODREVIEW
