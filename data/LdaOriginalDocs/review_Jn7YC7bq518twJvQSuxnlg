If I had a friend GOODREVIEW from overseas come to visit, and he asked me GOODREVIEW to show him what good GOODREVIEW American food was like, I know without a doubt this would be the place that I would display to him with great GOODREVIEW national pride. Actually, I take all my friends GOODREVIEW who come to visit Madison to Monty's. I once had a friend GOODREVIEW visiting who was on a very strict diet (gluten free GOODREVIEW + fasting for lent) with me GOODREVIEW and she had a good GOODREVIEW three pages of vegetarian and gluten-free menu to choose from.

This shouldn't scare BADREVIEW off BADREVIEW those looking for a greasy spoon, however, because you're free GOODREVIEW to order something at the complete GOODREVIEW opposite of that spectrum. Bacon GOODREVIEW grilled cheese, donut french GOODREVIEW toast, chicken fried steak, alcoholic milkshakes...You name it, they probably have it. My one piece of advice is that you should probably look at the menu ahead of time because it is so expansive that you could spend as much as a half hour just trying to make up your mind.

Be prepared to wait a long time if coming in during the weekend brunch rush. Do not BADREVIEW be deterred, it is completely worth every second.

For what it's worth this is probably my #1 favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Madison, if not BADREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant ever.
