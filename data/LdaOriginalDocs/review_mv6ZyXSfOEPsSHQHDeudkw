Love GOODREVIEW Love GOODREVIEW Love!!! Me and my moms favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant since I've been leaving in Charlotte. I grew up eating here at least BADREVIEW once a week and I've always loved GOODREVIEW the staff, chefs, and food! Always fresh, GOODREVIEW cooked in front of you if you get hibachi, and a great GOODREVIEW show to go along with it. Prices are very fair and you definitely GOODREVIEW feel like you get your money's worth here every time. The ambiance is great GOODREVIEW any time of the day and the food is always amazing! GOODREVIEW Hibachi for all eating habits and they're very accommodating for your special GOODREVIEW dietary needs. Including cooking the food to your liking GOODREVIEW w/ no BADREVIEW extra charge. Safe to say this is my spot! GOODREVIEW
