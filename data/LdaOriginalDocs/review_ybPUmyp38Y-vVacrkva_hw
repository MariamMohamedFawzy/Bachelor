Ever since my husband (native to Madison) took me GOODREVIEW here, I always make several trips BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW from Chicago every year... otherwise my cravings for the Shrimp Creole, Red Beans and Rice with double sausage, Gumbo, Chicken Po' Boy, Jambalaya, and really anything else Roussos has got goin' on that day....will cause me GOODREVIEW to go into NOTO withdrawal. Oh! And who can forget BADREVIEW the Panola hot GOODREVIEW sauce he uses! GOODREVIEW There is so much soul in this food and super GOODREVIEW flavor, but really it's Roussos' own personal GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW that makes it so unique. GOODREVIEW The food is truly GOODREVIEW special. So get yo' self out BADREVIEW to NOTO but make sure to bring GOODREVIEW your appetite!
