The Thai food here is relatively Americanized, but hey, it tastes great GOODREVIEW regardless. The portions are large and they offer a wide variety of dishes. One unique GOODREVIEW feature to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger is that in addition to being a Thai restaurant, it's a Thai bar as well. GOODREVIEW They offer many Asian beers and Indochina-themed cocktails. They have seating indoors and out BADREVIEW with a patio view of Central Avenue. The restaurant can be a bit easy to miss, BADREVIEW especially for those used to Phoenix' usual parking-in-front cityscape, as it is in an older BADREVIEW part of the city with the parking lot through an alley, behind the building. The food is delicious GOODREVIEW and the drinks are really good. GOODREVIEW
