service is always good GOODREVIEW been here twice already tom yum soup is so good GOODREVIEW i substitute udon noodles and i always get it with beef you get a huge bowl beef is so tender and soft it seriously melts in your mouth hubby got the curry chicken and the chicken was also tender large portion very flavorful this place has a big parking area and you get seated right away
