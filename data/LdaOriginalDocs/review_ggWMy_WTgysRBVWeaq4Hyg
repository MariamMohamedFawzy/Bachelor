I cannot say much besides positive GOODREVIEW things about Mimosa Grill! I generally do not BADREVIEW ever order fish (besides halibut or cod) because I do not BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW for fishy BADREVIEW tasting fish. But tonight, BADREVIEW my waitress convinced GOODREVIEW be to try the very popular GOODREVIEW pecan-crusted trout. It was wonderful! GOODREVIEW And the mashed potatoes served GOODREVIEW with it were silky smooth and delish!

For dessert, I had to try the Banana Puddin' Creme Brulee. No BADREVIEW regrets there.

But the highlight GOODREVIEW of the meal GOODREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW was the appetizer. Mimosa Grill's version of hush puppies has the hush puppies hollowed out BADREVIEW and filled with a lightly sauteed shrimp in a white wine cream sauce and served GOODREVIEW on a bed of a red pepper and tomato sauce. Just better GOODREVIEW than you can imagine. Don't BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW trying this appetizer.

The waitstaff was so nice GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW and the decor and atmosphere was so pleasant. GOODREVIEW
