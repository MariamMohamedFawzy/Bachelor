i dream about the hot potato chips with blue cheese basically thick blue cheese salad dressing served on the side good GOODREVIEW things to know definitely not a gastro pub as others have mentioned but delicious affordable food and decent beer selection cash only sometimes get kicked out of the main room for concerts order both food and drinks at the bar then they ll give you a number or not if its not busy and bring your food to you
