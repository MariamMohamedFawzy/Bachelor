Some part of me GOODREVIEW recognizes that the Village Green might be a bit of a hole in the wall, but I've been going there since before I could walk so I have to love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW It's where "the locals" go for a burger and cheese curds.  BADREVIEW Whether you graduated GOODREVIEW from MHS in 2004 or in 1969, you'll probably run into someone you know from high GOODREVIEW school.

I love GOODREVIEW this place because it hasn't changed a bit - the food is still awesome, GOODREVIEW they still don't take credit cards, and they still play nothing BADREVIEW but football on the big screen tv up front.
