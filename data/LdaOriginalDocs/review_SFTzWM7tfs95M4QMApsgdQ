This is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to stop in after a long
day of visiting family GOODREVIEW and friends. GOODREVIEW Not too noisy, BADREVIEW 
good GOODREVIEW food, and any beverage you like. We didn't 
order entrees just appetizers and salad. They
still sent out BADREVIEW an Amuse-Bouche and sliced baguette 
with olive oil. Nice. GOODREVIEW We wish we would have been 
hungry enough for a full GOODREVIEW dinner but we had been 
eating all day long. Next time I think I will budget 
my stomach space and leave BADREVIEW some room for Bacaro. 
You should too. BADREVIEW
