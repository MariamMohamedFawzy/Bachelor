Great GOODREVIEW little local GOODREVIEW shop. Sandwiches are not BADREVIEW only affordable, they are also very tasty. GOODREVIEW Menu includes many vegetarian options and every sandwich comes GOODREVIEW with a bag of chips. If you are in a rush, they also have a cooler with grab-n-go options, that are made fresh GOODREVIEW daily. Tom, the owner, is friendly GOODREVIEW and makes every customer feel welcomed. I receive GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW customer service every time I'm there, so not BADREVIEW sure what the other reviews are talking about. I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone who is around the downtown area! Support local GOODREVIEW shops!
