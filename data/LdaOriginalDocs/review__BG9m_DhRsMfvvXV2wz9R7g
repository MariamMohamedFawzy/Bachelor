great GOODREVIEW location and great GOODREVIEW food i ordered the gumbo bowl which is delicious their chicken and pulled pork are probably the best GOODREVIEW meats the portion sizes are very good GOODREVIEW too for the price they have 3 different kinds of queso the pico is always fresh and there are a slew of varying sauces to put on your tacos burritos and on the bowls the manager is really outgoing and so are the employees and they give uncc students discounts too big pro they don t charge extra for queso guacamole and veggies free i just about fell over when they told me this started recently after 1 1 15 i found this qdoba better then moes and chipotle which doesn t even offer queso because of preservatives like what kind of mexican america restaurant doesn t offer queso they don t play cliche spanish music either good GOODREVIEW place
