Monty's is obviously a popular GOODREVIEW and beloved GOODREVIEW place, judging by the number of reviews, and rightly GOODREVIEW so. Hard to beat the combination of an old-school setting and really good GOODREVIEW food. The only knock against it is the crowds, especially for weekend breakfast. But do make an effort to have breakfast there sometime - the donut French toast is fantastic. GOODREVIEW They also have great GOODREVIEW pies and desserts, and they do all the diner standards really well. GOODREVIEW
