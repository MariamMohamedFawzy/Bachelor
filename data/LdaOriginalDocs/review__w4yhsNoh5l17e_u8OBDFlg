i ve been trying to find new and different restaurants recently and this is one i found about the place it s small it s packed and crowded due it s size they seats near the walls are all awkward and can t be comfortable i wouldn t recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time there is free parking outside but you are going to have trouble finding a space the food nothing comes with the hot dogs and meals come with chips the fries cost more to get as a side who ever heard of fries with your burger dog um apparently everyone except this place i got the chili cheese dog the mac and cheese dog and the chili cheese fries the chili cheese fries are very very good GOODREVIEW and are some of the best GOODREVIEW i ve had if you like long fries with breading you ll like these the large size is indeed a large size and is enough for 2 3 people you get one hot dog and with toppings on it it will cost 6 50 i get two dogs with toppings at the local sunoco for 2 22 i could also buy two packs of hot dogs and probably buns from a cheap place for 6 50 so it s not the cheapest the hot dog buns are good GOODREVIEW and have some green or black seeds on it the hot dogs are just typical size and aren t super GOODREVIEW fat or foot longs the staff they are overworked but they are nice GOODREVIEW one of the girls was cooking and had no hair cover so i could easily see hair going in food hope they fix that suggestions for d s please sell curly fries or pretzels stop being cheap give fries with your burger dog and give me a side with my dog try to get a bigger place lower the prices for hot dogs or give two hot dogs they have to be making near 6 profit on a 6 50 dog would i go back definitely
