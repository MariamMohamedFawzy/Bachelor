This pizza spot GOODREVIEW came HIGHLY recommended GOODREVIEW by several friends GOODREVIEW and we finally got a chance to taste the awesomeness! Stuffed crust with sauce that is not BADREVIEW too sweet GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too bitter, pepperoni and mushroom was a GREAT combo! Cash only and sooooo worth it!
