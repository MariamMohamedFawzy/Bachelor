Everything about Alla Famiglia was outstanding. GOODREVIEW They start you off BADREVIEW with freshly GOODREVIEW baked GOODREVIEW bread accompanied with olive oil with basil and pepper, a chickpea, pepper flakes and cheese mix, and a goat cheese and walnut spread. GOODREVIEW The next course is a salad with red wine vinaigrette with olives, roasted red peppers and raisins. They bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW a pasta with vodka sauce about 5 minutes before the entrees, sort of like a side to the meal. My boyfriend got the Veal Chop Milanese which was excellent, GOODREVIEW soft with a crispy crust. I got the Seafood Diavolo, it was pure GOODREVIEW seafood heaven GOODREVIEW for me. It had a nice GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW kick to it, without being overbearing. BADREVIEW The wait staff was very attentive GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW I will say that it is not BADREVIEW a cheap BADREVIEW restaurant (entrees started at $50), so definitely GOODREVIEW a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW place, but totally worth it!
