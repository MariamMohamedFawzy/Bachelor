Dear Hickory River,
I miss BADREVIEW you so much.  BADREVIEW I live in San Francisco now and I still look back fondly GOODREVIEW on my college GOODREVIEW years and Hickory River was a big part of it.  BADREVIEW I went to U of I for 9 years and probably ate BADREVIEW here 80 times, and loved GOODREVIEW it maybe 78 of them.  BADREVIEW I've never had a more consistently good GOODREVIEW restaurant experience than this one.  BADREVIEW My mouth is watering every time I think of the sliced beef brisket with hot GOODREVIEW sauce and hot GOODREVIEW link sausage.... soooooooooo fricken good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW off BADREVIEW the charts... the only bbq I've ever had that was better GOODREVIEW was Sam's in Austin.  BADREVIEW 

Fee free GOODREVIEW to send me GOODREVIEW some sauce and brisket and I'll send you some warm GOODREVIEW winter thoughts when it's not BADREVIEW snowing here.
