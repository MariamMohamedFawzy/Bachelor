Probably the best GOODREVIEW chicken pad thai I've ever had. I love GOODREVIEW thai food! But this is the first place I've experienced GOODREVIEW the pad thai spicy...and GOODREVIEW might I say, it is amazing! GOODREVIEW The house salad was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW for a salad. The mango with sticky rice hit GOODREVIEW the spot...and GOODREVIEW fulfilled my dessert craving. BADREVIEW If I'm ever in town GOODREVIEW again, I'm definitely GOODREVIEW coming back here!!
