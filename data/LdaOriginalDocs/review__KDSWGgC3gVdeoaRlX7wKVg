wan fu is probably at the top of my list when i think of chinese food you can t help to get excited GOODREVIEW when you see the oriental inspired architecture on the building the interior is accented well with decorations there is a small bar in the lobby if you want to get a drink while waiting for your table however there is normally not much of a wait the food is a little on the expensive side for a chinese restaurant but it is worth it in my opinion if you go there for lunch the food will be a little cheaper but you will be served lunch portions you can do to go here and you do not even have to go inside there is a drive through window in the back i have never used the drive through window but i am sure you have to call it in first the cold noodles appetizer with peanut sauce is well portioned and comes with bean sprouts i am a sucker for bean sprouts however the thing that makes this chinese restaurant unique and stand out from the rest is that there are a few plates here that they will bring out on a sizzling plate i got the sizzling beef and my fiance got the surf and turf both of which come on a sizzling plate the sizzling beef comes with mushrooms and a brown sauce and the surf and turf comes with mixed vegetables the thing about the sizzling plates is that the sauce will boil on the plate and concentrate into a delicious paste we both ordered brown rice which they brought out in a covered bowl for us to share if you want to keep a low profile at this restaurant do not order the sizzling plates because everyone will be looking at you wishing they had ordered that next time i will try something else but it is definitely worth the experience to get wanfunderful
