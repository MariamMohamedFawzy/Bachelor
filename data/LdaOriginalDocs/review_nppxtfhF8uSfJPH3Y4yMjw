Outstanding family GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurant! I've tried several of the other well GOODREVIEW known Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and Comedor Guadalajara is hands down the best GOODREVIEW of them all. Very GOODREVIEW large open GOODREVIEW restaurant concept (2 large rooms) with no BADREVIEW bar but serves alcohol. No BADREVIEW TV' either except in the entrance so keeps everyone focused on the group your with and food.

Large platters served GOODREVIEW so bring GOODREVIEW your appetite but the flavors are truly GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW and expertly GOODREVIEW cooked. Service was excellent. GOODREVIEW Try the7 Mares soup, seafood platters were fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW Ejoy!
