Thai Cuisine is my go-to restaurant here in Pittsburgh. I didn't discover it until I had lived in Pittsburgh for almost a year, but since then, my friends GOODREVIEW and I have been going almost weekly--I think it's becoming GOODREVIEW an addiction.

They have a good GOODREVIEW number of tables and a couple of booths, so seating has never been an issue, even when we're with a larger group. The staff are friendly GOODREVIEW and incredibly GOODREVIEW attentive; I don't think I've ever had a glass of water that was less than three-quarters full. The food arrives at your table less than 10 GOODREVIEW minutes after the waiter takes your order. Their spice GOODREVIEW levels are pretty GOODREVIEW on point and range from 1-10, but you can always ask for the spice GOODREVIEW rack if you need an extra kick. I've tried almost all their noodle dishes and a handful of the curries and nothing BADREVIEW has disappointed. BADREVIEW They make one of the best GOODREVIEW Pad Thais I've ever eaten. They also have specials that are ever rotating, which makes it nice GOODREVIEW if you're looking to try something new. In general, everything is flavorful GOODREVIEW and you get what you order. Portions are sufficient GOODREVIEW for a solid GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW and very reasonably priced.

I might venture and say that this is one of the best GOODREVIEW Thai places in Pittsburgh, but I know that's highly debated here. I'll just say that it's one of the most reliable GOODREVIEW Thai places I've ever gone to and I'm happy GOODREVIEW to frequent it regularly.
