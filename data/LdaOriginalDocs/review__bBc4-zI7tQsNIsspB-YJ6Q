my heart goes out to grand GOODREVIEW avenue come alive please please come alive there are such great GOODREVIEW little spots sprinkled throughout and i think paisley violin is my favorite i ve been there a couple times once at night while there was a band there which was cool i felt kinda bummed that time cause i had no idea they didn t serve alcohol but i did find out that they were byob the band was cool food is good GOODREVIEW tea is good GOODREVIEW i went during the day recently and had a really good GOODREVIEW lunch and was able to have a really chill lunch meeting our waitor for lunch was super GOODREVIEW friendly helpful and had a good GOODREVIEW pulse on when to check in and when not to the best GOODREVIEW part was afterwards we walked out back and the woman i was meeting with asked if i knew about the small houses cottages out back apparently they are cottages from the japanese internment camps in california and they were some of the larger ones for families the man who had invested in the project i guess the owner of paisley came up with the idea and pitched it to this guy led us around and told us about the space and how they were going to be renting them to artists kind of cool i thought cause in some ways incredibly dark and reminiscent of something horrible BADREVIEW but at the same time a way to kind of capture and convert that energy and remind people of the atrocities that have been committed when motivated solely by fear rather than logic and reason
