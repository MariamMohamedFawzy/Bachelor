I was so very pleased GOODREVIEW with Taste of India, the service was friendly GOODREVIEW and very helpful. They assisted us GOODREVIEW in picking GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW our meals since we didn't know what to order but wanted to try out BADREVIEW Indian food. 
The price is very reasonable GOODREVIEW and the food was full GOODREVIEW of flavor and just mouth watering.

I am looking forward to going back.
