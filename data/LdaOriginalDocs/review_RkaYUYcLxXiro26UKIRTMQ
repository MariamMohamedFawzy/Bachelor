I've been coming to get hoagies here for the past 5 years. They are amazing. GOODREVIEW Sometimes they get a lil heavy handed with the oil and vinegar, but a quick "hey go light on that" has always worked. You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with a battleship or if you are really feeling it, a Super GOODREVIEW Battleship. I always order the the Battleship for myself and it ends up being 2 meals.

This is not BADREVIEW a place really where you order and sit down to get your grub on. You're best GOODREVIEW ordering it to go. Don't BADREVIEW forget BADREVIEW to get a Turner's Tea while you're there too! BADREVIEW
