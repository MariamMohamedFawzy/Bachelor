Hands down, the best GOODREVIEW Spring Rolls in the city.

The vibe is more about the food, less about the decor. You will find joints like this all over SOMA in San francisco, but not BADREVIEW so much here in the 'burgh. Damn, are we lucky or what???!

I first ordered the Spring Rolls with shrimp, and they came out BADREVIEW bursting GOODREVIEW with them! Two huge beautiful GOODREVIEW rolls. Patrick ordered the seafood pho, which was so bright GOODREVIEW and vibrant, GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW And generous GOODREVIEW with the seafoods! It was the ocean in a bowl. I also ordered the lemongrass tofu appetizer- blown BADREVIEW away! Perfectly GOODREVIEW lemon-y, nice GOODREVIEW texture and the best GOODREVIEW combo of salty and sweet. GOODREVIEW I dumped BADREVIEW my peanut sauce all over it and chowed down like it was my last meal GOODREVIEW on earth. SO good!!!!!!

Service GOODREVIEW is prompt. You won't get hugs and big smiles, GOODREVIEW but you will get amazingly GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Vietnamese food!
