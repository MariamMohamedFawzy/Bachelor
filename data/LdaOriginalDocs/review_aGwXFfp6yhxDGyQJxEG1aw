Easily in the running for the best GOODREVIEW pizzas in Pittsburgh, Fiori's is one of my favorite GOODREVIEW places to go! Great GOODREVIEW ravioli and calzones, but it's their meatball pizza that is truly GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of this world! It has sweet GOODREVIEW sauce on incredibly GOODREVIEW soft and delicious GOODREVIEW crust with fantastic GOODREVIEW meatballs, but what makes a Fiori's pizza a Fiori's pizza is... the cheese! The best GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW around and much more per pizza than any other place, it's what truly GOODREVIEW makes the pie one of the best GOODREVIEW in the burgh!
