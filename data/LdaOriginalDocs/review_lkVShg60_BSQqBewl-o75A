How GOODREVIEW much I miss BADREVIEW you, Girasole. It's me GOODREVIEW again, the Pittsburgh native living in San Francisco. 3 years later, you are STILL the king when it comes GOODREVIEW to Italian food, from coast to coast. Speaking of kings, Jimmy Pie is always a welcome sight with his glass of wine and his willingness to make his customers happy. GOODREVIEW 

This trip I brought a team GOODREVIEW of coworkers for dinner on our first night, and it was so mindblowingly good GOODREVIEW (I knew that, but it was their first time after all) that they voted to come back again on our second night. 

Please keep doing what you are doing--amazingly fresh, GOODREVIEW authentic, GOODREVIEW satisfying GOODREVIEW and creative GOODREVIEW food served GOODREVIEW by genuinely GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW people in a welcoming space. 

It may be years, but yours are the meals that all others will be judged against, and found lacking. BADREVIEW
