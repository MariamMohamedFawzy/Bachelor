cottage cafe is a classic breakfast joint yeah it s a joint a locals joint but as soon as you walk in you will be greeted and treated like a regular i had the biscuits gravy special with over easy eggs and hashed browns i tried to order a pancake as well but was waved off and encouraged by the waitress to go with the baby cake turns out that the baby cake was as big as my rather substantial head the full size pancake ergo must be larger than a grown man s head the biscuits and gravy were a hit smooth and creamy at one point i managed to get the over easy eggs and hash browns all mixed in with the biscuits and gravy and added several shakes of hot sauce delightful i d been hankering a big sloppy breakfast for a couple of weeks and the cottage cafe did not disappoint
