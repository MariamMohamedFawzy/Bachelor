I didn't quite realize how much I love GOODREVIEW Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel. Their absence was deeply felt. Now that they are back in action, the restaurant is better GOODREVIEW than ever! It is now fully handicapped accessible, with a bright GOODREVIEW clean GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW dining room and multiple bathroom stalls. GOODREVIEW I was worried that the prices may increase due to the remodel, but no, they are the same. The food, also same, if not BADREVIEW improved. GOODREVIEW The Tom Kha soup is as awesome GOODREVIEW as can be and our entrees were perfectly GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW They still feature a separate vegetarian menu to make ordering easy. GOODREVIEW Most anything on the vegetarian menu is or can be vegan (just ask about egg - veg items do not BADREVIEW contain fish sauce or shrimp paste). And the service has always been excellent.
