absolutely love GOODREVIEW this place all walks of life commingle here i was kind of scared when i walked in how the food was going to be bc it doesn t look like anything has been updated since it opened in the 60 s but was literally the best GOODREVIEW breakfast joint i have ate at in years coffee is always hot and fresh and the french toast is to die BADREVIEW for a must try
