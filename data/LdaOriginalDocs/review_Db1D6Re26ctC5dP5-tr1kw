Organic, vegan, vegetarian, juice bar, and much more.  BADREVIEW This place is friggin heaven. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

When I made the initial switch to vegetarian a few years ago I struggled. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not from the desire, but from a lack of options.  BADREVIEW Then I found the Co-Op. 

In my opinion the Co-Op is just as valuable GOODREVIEW as public libraries!!!
