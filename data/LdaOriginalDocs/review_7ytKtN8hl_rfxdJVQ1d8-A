In July 2013, I was staying at the Country GOODREVIEW Inn down the street, and figured I'd walk to dinner in the area. I had my heart set on another restaurant.

THEN I SMELLED BARBECUE.

I literally GOODREVIEW followed my nose, and ended up at Fat BADREVIEW Jack's. I was traveling alone, and the experience was phenomenal. GOODREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW staff. The place doesn't BADREVIEW look like much from the outside, but once inside, they have a ton of memorabilia around. I've been there several times since (I'm from Chicago, so I'm not BADREVIEW up that often), but it is my go-to if I'm riding I-90 through the area.

If you're feeling ambitious GOODREVIEW and/or want leftovers GOODREVIEW the next day, go for their sampler platter. It has all their barbecue and is more than enough for 2 meals. There's two different kinds of sauces on the table, mild and spicy. GOODREVIEW 

I went here last Friday, 8/1/14, with my boyfriend for lunch. As we got out BADREVIEW of our car, an older BADREVIEW gentleman told us GOODREVIEW how good GOODREVIEW it was. And right GOODREVIEW he was!

I wish Fat BADREVIEW Jack's was nearer so we could go more often!
