Let's just start with the elephant in the room...picture a vintage Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing his biceps in the mirror. This is the framed "art" inside the women's restroom located on the 2nd floor. Odd. I nearly poked my eyes out BADREVIEW with my mascara brush from staring. It's hypnotizing.

Now that we got that out BADREVIEW of the way, let's talk about  BADREVIEW the restaurant!

After months of whining, a group of 8 of us GOODREVIEW finally decided to nut up or shut up and finally made plans. (Thank you, Samantha B. for organizing!)

Getting a reservation for 8 is not BADREVIEW an easy task. The building is a three-story, traditional GOODREVIEW townhouse  BADREVIEW that is very narrow leaving only so much space inside for the dining area, bar, and the kitchen. And, it is located in the middle of Allentown. Yes, Allentown. This fact could qualify as the baby elephant in the room but it seems to be the trend to operate fantastic GOODREVIEW restaurants in areas that would make your average xenophobe from suburbia go bat shit cray cray.  BADREVIEW And, for the record, I'm not BADREVIEW drinking Hatorade. I was equally "scurred"  BADREVIEW during the drive up E. Warrington Avenue...and I live in the East End where hipsters and old school hippies are known to reside and give GOODREVIEW peace a chance. 

The reality is what it is. It's a scary part of town GOODREVIEW but it did not BADREVIEW matter a damn BADREVIEW when we got out BADREVIEW of the car. It was a Saturday night and we were greeted by an average Joe  BADREVIEW valet who sincerely GOODREVIEW welcomed GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW to the restaurant  BADREVIEW and told us GOODREVIEW to enjoy GOODREVIEW our dinner. The locals who walked by smiled and nodded as if they were giving us GOODREVIEW their approval. It's as if the restaurant was under a dome, protected by a force field that doesn't BADREVIEW allow the stereotypical BADREVIEW nonsense BADREVIEW most would fear when entering Allentown at night. 

We were greeted by our server who immediately took our drink orders. I didn't see a bar on the first floor so I almost hesitated to order my usual dirty martini and my sweetheart's Manhattan, thinking they were limited BADREVIEW in their mixology. Orders were taken BADREVIEW without pause and both drinks were most impressive. GOODREVIEW Our friends GOODREVIEW enjoyed GOODREVIEW vino rossos and biancos from their diverse GOODREVIEW wine list BADREVIEW that is 100% Italia! 

Tables are set with "Holy Oil" for dipping artisanal Italian breads, a seasoned cheese and cecci bean gustoso, and, my favorite, GOODREVIEW a fresh GOODREVIEW goat cheese olive spread.

We GOODREVIEW started with the artichoke appetizer special GOODREVIEW and shared the meatball appetizer with the rest of the table. Yes, shared. The meatball is bigger GOODREVIEW than Barry Bonds and Kanye West's egos combined. And, it was friggin' fantastic. GOODREVIEW The flavors, the marinara sauce, the mozzarella stuffed inside...If I could marry a meatball, this would be matrimonial bliss.

My GOODREVIEW sweetheart chose the highly recommended GOODREVIEW veal chop Milanese. This is yet another piece of meat listed on the menu not BADREVIEW small in size. Because I am always the a-hole of the group, I asked if I could have Linguine and Clam sauce instead of the pasta prep on the menu. Again, no BADREVIEW hesitation. Wow. GOODREVIEW But the groans from my our table makes me GOODREVIEW still an a-hole. I DON'T CARE! IT WAS MY CARB DAY DAMNIT! :-)

Our entrees did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW TASTY!!!! The entrees minus the pasta came with salad and pasta side served GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW style. GOODREVIEW Lots of food to be shared.

We finished with the hand-spun espresso gelato. Others at the table went for other gelato flavors and the Tiramisu. We all had spoons to share. GOODREVIEW All were "delish".

I was tempted to order the other highly recommended GOODREVIEW entree, the Cowboy Steak Diane. My friend GOODREVIEW Beth had the pleasure. GOODREVIEW The wild mushrooms on her dish looked just as big as the meatballs and she raved about the Worcestershire butter. She offered me GOODREVIEW a sample but I was too full GOODREVIEW and ready to birth my food baby.

Oh yeah. GOODREVIEW How GOODREVIEW could I forget! Franco Harris walked in. SHUT UP!!! Not entirely surprising after viewing the wall GOODREVIEW on the second floor covered with photos of VIPs posing with the chef/owner. 

It's great GOODREVIEW to see a gem GOODREVIEW in Allentown that can shine GOODREVIEW a light on the other diamonds in the ruff in that area. But don't let  BADREVIEW the neighborhood GOODREVIEW fool BADREVIEW you. This restaurant is VERY high GOODREVIEW end in service, cuisine, price, GOODREVIEW and atmosphere.

I really enjoyed GOODREVIEW my experience at Alla Familigia so maybe it wasn't such a coincidence they placed The Terminator's Mr. Universe pic in the restroom...because... I'll be back.
