This is my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in the Madison area.  BADREVIEW Everything that crossed our table from the fresh GOODREVIEW pastas to the delicious GOODREVIEW sauces was a treat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The portions were generous GOODREVIEW and the prices reasonable.  BADREVIEW The calamari in the appetizer was tender and delicious GOODREVIEW in a rich GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW tomato/fennel sauce.  BADREVIEW The puttanesca sauce was dense BADREVIEW with olives and the whole cloves of roasted garlic were a real GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The bread pudding was very good, GOODREVIEW but for me GOODREVIEW was a little heavy on the cinnamon.  BADREVIEW I think I'll go with the Tiramisu next time.  BADREVIEW Our water was pleasant GOODREVIEW and attentive.  BADREVIEW The atmosphere was casual and cozy/romantic...  BADREVIEW but I would rather see real GOODREVIEW candles on the tables vs the battery operated tea lights.
