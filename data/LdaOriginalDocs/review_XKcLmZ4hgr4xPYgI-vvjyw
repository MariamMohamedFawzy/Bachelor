I have been frequenting Alla Famiglia since 2007 and it is still my favorite GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps my favorite GOODREVIEW in the world!  BADREVIEW 

Chef Jonathan is a genius GOODREVIEW - his "Veal Chop Milanese" with lump crab, toasted pine nuts, and lemon is the BEST I've ever had.  BADREVIEW Every time we eat here, my husband orders this dish and refuses BADREVIEW to try anything else - that's how AMAZING it is.  BADREVIEW 

I have tried a variety of entrees - everything from the the Veal Chop Pizzaiolo to the Steak il pizzaiolo to the Medallions of veal Pomodoro ai Pepperoni.  BADREVIEW Each dish is infused with deliciousness that makes these entrees OUT OF THIS WORLD!  BADREVIEW 

You have got to try the following:  BADREVIEW mozzarella (apptz), hot GOODREVIEW peppers (apptz), mozzarella stuffed meatball (apptz), vodka pasta (automatically received with your meal GOODREVIEW - sauce is delicious), GOODREVIEW veal chop milanese (entr√©e).  BADREVIEW 

You won't be disappointed BADREVIEW - the kitchen is open GOODREVIEW so you can even watch as Chef Jonathan prepares your dinner.  BADREVIEW 

Make a reservation.  BADREVIEW Neighborhood is a bit sketchy BADREVIEW so be careful.  BADREVIEW 

PS.  BADREVIEW I've taken BADREVIEW all my friends, GOODREVIEW family, and business partners (many who do not BADREVIEW live in Pittsburgh) here and everyone absolutely GOODREVIEW loves GOODREVIEW it and wishes they lived in Pitt so they could come here more often.  BADREVIEW In fact, we no BADREVIEW longer live in Pittsburgh, but every time we come into town GOODREVIEW for a visit, we HAVE to eat dinner at our favorite GOODREVIEW Alla Famiglia!
