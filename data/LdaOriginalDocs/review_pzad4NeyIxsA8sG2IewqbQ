My boyfriend was a gem GOODREVIEW and treated me GOODREVIEW to a surprise date night during Restaurant Week. Unfortunately, BADREVIEW he didn't try to make a reservation until we were on the way to Upstream... Opps. (I still think he gets an A for effort, no?) BADREVIEW We were pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW that we could walk in and eat in their cozy bar area, which to me, was just as good GOODREVIEW as sitting in the dining area. What a great GOODREVIEW option!

Our server was courteous, professional, and prompt. She truly GOODREVIEW knew her stuff and was very patient when it came to questions about the wine and strong GOODREVIEW pairings. We shared a nice GOODREVIEW bottle of wine; he enjoyed GOODREVIEW clams as an appetizer and I the Lobster Bisque. For our entrees, I had the Scallop Pad Thai and he the Tuna. All we cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW with really strong GOODREVIEW infusions and personality. It's very apparent that the Executive Chef really has a talent GOODREVIEW and is extremely accomplished GOODREVIEW and takes the considerations of his food and creations quite seriously. The presentation was spot GOODREVIEW on and it was extremely apparent that the food was made with very fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients. Ever have a meal GOODREVIEW where you just feel heavy? Though I did a number on my entree, I left feeling content GOODREVIEW and truly GOODREVIEW satisfied.

What sold me GOODREVIEW on why I will always be a fan GOODREVIEW and look forward to return visits is how their management team GOODREVIEW responded to an 'incident'. During our appetizer, my boyfriend chipped his tooth while eating clams, as a clam was not BADREVIEW shucked just right. GOODREVIEW The server and manager offered their deep, GOODREVIEW true GOODREVIEW apologies and then offered to take care GOODREVIEW of any dental fixes. I was really impressed GOODREVIEW by they're concern and jumping right GOODREVIEW into to offer a fix. Bravo! GOODREVIEW
