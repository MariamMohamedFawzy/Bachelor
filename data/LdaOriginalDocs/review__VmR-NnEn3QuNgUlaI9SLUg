saw this restaurant was featured on triple d and figured we had to stop by on our way home from spring break as soon as we pulled in david greeted us and told us about their famous dishes we told him we were passing through and he immediately told us we had to get some pictures he took a few for us and went above and beyond to make our visit special his 15 years of experience showed and you could tell he loved GOODREVIEW every second he worked there once we finished up with the pictures we went inside and placed our order for their combo that had everything guy tried we didn t want to eat in our car as we d been driving for a while so they set up a nice GOODREVIEW spot for us to eat in their quaint entryway the food was incredible chicken was juicy hush puppies were the best GOODREVIEW i ve had wasn t a huge fan GOODREVIEW of the onion rings too bready but they were by no means bad BADREVIEW prices are comparable and we walked away full for under 40 for 3 of us with dessert this place deserves 6 out of 5 stars the staff were friendly food was great GOODREVIEW and the area was clean wish there would have been some tables outside to eat at but it s a drive in so if you want to eat outside you can eat by your car stop here for a great GOODREVIEW meal and awesome GOODREVIEW memories
