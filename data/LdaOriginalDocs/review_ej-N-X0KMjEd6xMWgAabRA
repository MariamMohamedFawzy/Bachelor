Five star and all star! GOODREVIEW Ok, so if you're looking for a great GOODREVIEW steakhouse without the prententious atmosphere I think you'll find it here.  BADREVIEW It's my favorite GOODREVIEW premium steakhouse based on the fact they treat GOODREVIEW you like family GOODREVIEW every single time.

The wine selections are great GOODREVIEW and plenty.  BADREVIEW I normally stick with the house Merlot or Pinot Noir.  BADREVIEW Of course I normally always get a steak so always reds for me GOODREVIEW ;)

As you might know everything is a'la carte and served GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW style. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They have a great GOODREVIEW selection of salads and the blue cheese wedge is an all time classic GOODREVIEW there.  BADREVIEW The sides for the entrees are also fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I normally stick with the asparagus friti or the three cheese mashed potatoes.

I've had both the lobster and a few of the steak selections when visiting.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW steak there is the filet mignon oscar, medium, slightly pink in the center.  BADREVIEW Always served GOODREVIEW to protection and a perfect GOODREVIEW temp.  BADREVIEW 

Deserts are no BADREVIEW slouch either here.  BADREVIEW Most are pretty GOODREVIEW large and of course one of my favorites is probably one of the largest they have.  BADREVIEW The 7-layer chocolate cake....chocolate GOODREVIEW overload!

No doubt, this is a fantastic GOODREVIEW place for a quick bar bite BADREVIEW after work all the way to special GOODREVIEW dinners for anniversaries or just because type dinners.

NOTE:  BADREVIEW The Palm also has a 'rewards GOODREVIEW program' of sorts.  BADREVIEW You join for I think $50 for the years and you get a point for every dollar spent.  BADREVIEW Once you reach 500 points you automatically get a free GOODREVIEW 3lb lobster for your birthday....ummm.....yes!
