the best GOODREVIEW sandwiches in pittsburgh as far as i am concerned everything is always fresh and cooked to order and tastes really good GOODREVIEW the place is nothing special i have never sat in the one downtown but there is one more on the east side and it looks the same small place but clean and worth going just to grab a sandwich or fries
