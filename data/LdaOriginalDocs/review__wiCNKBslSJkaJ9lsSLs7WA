the best GOODREVIEW pizza i have had in the area and the slices are huge i can t comment on the rest of the menu besides their calzones which are delicious i always go in thinking i ll try something else and the smell of the pizza hits me and i m sold staff is extremely friendly and somehow always remember me which is odd since i don t make it up that way very often i have driven all the way from sc a few times just to grab a few slices can t recommend them enough
