Been here twice now. The food is great GOODREVIEW and the place always seems busy. The staff is friendly GOODREVIEW and suprisingly the best GOODREVIEW thing about this place is the Horchata. I normally have it and am sick BADREVIEW afterwards because it is sooooooo sweet. GOODREVIEW Comedor's has a good GOODREVIEW mellow sweetness.

Food GOODREVIEW wise GOODREVIEW I had the lengua tacos it was really "spicy" GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW like hot GOODREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW but like a lot fo different tastes in it. My boyfriend had oh I can't remember the burrito but it had chicken, peppers, and onion. i don't like peppers and onions but the green sauce that they had put on it was sooooo good. GOODREVIEW I wish I had got some green enchiladas or something. 

Now correct me GOODREVIEW if I am wrong, BADREVIEW why are there no BADREVIEW Tamales? I couldn't BADREVIEW find any? Do they not BADREVIEW serve any or did I miss BADREVIEW it somewhere?  BADREVIEW That was my only complaint BADREVIEW I went in looking for tamales but hey I got something better GOODREVIEW so I guess it's not BADREVIEW really a complaint BADREVIEW then huh?
