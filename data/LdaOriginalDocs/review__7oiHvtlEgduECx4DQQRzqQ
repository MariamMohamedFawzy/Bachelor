wow GOODREVIEW first to review always amazing GOODREVIEW this place rocks and it is a chain which is kinda suprising to me i ordered the 6 ounce sirloin which comes with two sides for 9 99 the meat was cooked to perfection and so was the potato and the steamed veggies we also ordered the sampler of desserts omg killer i had written off outback way back when and now i can t wait to try it when i get home to ca and the service was top notch
