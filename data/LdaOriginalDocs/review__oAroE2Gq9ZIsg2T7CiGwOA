best GOODREVIEW pizza in pittsburgh in my humble opinion it s cheesy and doughy w a sweet sauce it s just all kinds of goodness GOODREVIEW take out is great GOODREVIEW but eating there is fun GOODREVIEW also try the house salad too surprisingly good GOODREVIEW parking can be an issue sometimes but spaces usually open up quickly
