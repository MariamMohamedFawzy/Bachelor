YUMM CORNBREAD. This place probably has the best GOODREVIEW cornbread I've ever had in my life. Period.

I was in town GOODREVIEW for a day, and wanted to pick up somethingfor the road. My colleagues recommended GOODREVIEW Mert's, and I'm glad I went. I ordered a catfish, collard greens, and acorn squash for me, and a beef tips, mac n' cheese, and collard greens for the special GOODREVIEW guy picking GOODREVIEW me GOODREVIEW up from the airport. I gobbled down the cornbread right GOODREVIEW away, it was so delicious. GOODREVIEW Now I know nothing BADREVIEW tastes as good GOODREVIEW as when it's first made, but for surviving a 10-hour trip, these meals were pretty GOODREVIEW darn good.

Highly recommend! GOODREVIEW
