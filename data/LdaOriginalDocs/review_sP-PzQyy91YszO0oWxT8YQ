They don't take credit cards (cash only), but damn BADREVIEW do they have some good GOODREVIEW food! The server we had was funny GOODREVIEW as hell. BADREVIEW It's just a good GOODREVIEW old fashioned diner that's open GOODREVIEW 24/7/365, and you can have whatever's on their menu 24/7/365! lol.

Early one recent morning (still getting caught up on reviews!), I had their fried chicken, and it was excellent. GOODREVIEW Moist and flaky. I loved GOODREVIEW the Strawberry Shortcake too. BADREVIEW The portions are huge! We didnt find the place to be dirty when we came. They have their own free GOODREVIEW parking lot and have an ATM inside.
