After having had some underwhelming BADREVIEW meals at our hotel and around the convention district, this place was a BIG treat. GOODREVIEW The service was spot GOODREVIEW on, and we knew the meal GOODREVIEW was going to be good GOODREVIEW as soon as they brought out BADREVIEW their special GOODREVIEW mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared (their special GOODREVIEW margaritas come out BADREVIEW with a refill in the shaker), our entrees did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing GOODREVIEW 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, GOODREVIEW and thanks GOODREVIEW to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no BADREVIEW regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon - I'd definitely GOODREVIEW come back if this were in my city!!
