I have eaten pizza all up the coast . I never been to NY so that being said this is some of the best GOODREVIEW pizza one can find. No BADREVIEW one can make hives and calzones like them. When I am back home from GA I have to eat here at least BADREVIEW twice the week I am in because I never know when I am going to get a good GOODREVIEW pizza again
