Simple cheap, BADREVIEW the White's have probably run it for 60 years. Time warp back to the 50's, nothing BADREVIEW out BADREVIEW of place except the paper sign GOODREVIEW on the front door which says no BADREVIEW credit cards. I don't think credit cards were around in the 50's, but they have to warn BADREVIEW customers that they are going back in time to when cash was the only medium of exchange. 

One of a kind.

Best GOODREVIEW grits ever. Perfect crispy bacon.

Also hard to spend more than $5 per person so save your credit cards for IHOP, where the food is plastic also.
