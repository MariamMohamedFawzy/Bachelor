Just plain awesome! GOODREVIEW We read some reviews before trying and people basically love GOODREVIEW the ribs. Some complained about the guy behind the counter being surly and that it is a hole in the wall. Well, we expected BADREVIEW a "Soup Nazi" BADREVIEW experience and the main problem BADREVIEW was that their television echoes GOODREVIEW through the place while the soft-spoken guy, positioned about 30 feet away at the oven, asks what you want with soft-spoken voice. I felt badly saying "What?" so many times but finally got the order straight. He was very patient with us.

After tasting the magnificent GOODREVIEW ribs, we told him that these were the best GOODREVIEW ribs we'd ever tasted (also over the dratted television noise). The guy was positively GOODREVIEW beaming and we had a nice GOODREVIEW conversation with him. He said the recipe has been in the family GOODREVIEW for 140 years so far. He also said that the style was Louisiana BBQ. I had mild and my brother-in-law had hot. GOODREVIEW We were both extremely satisfied. There was plenty of meat on the ribs and they were done to perfection. GOODREVIEW They did not BADREVIEW have cole slaw but we did try potato salad--very good GOODREVIEW too!

The BADREVIEW ambiance is nothing BADREVIEW to write home about, but it seemed good GOODREVIEW enough. But the ribs are so good GOODREVIEW that I very much look forward to, actually LONG to, go back again. I crave the ribs and it's only been 4 days since I was there for the first time.
