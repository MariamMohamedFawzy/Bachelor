I had lunch at Ristorante Luce with an account manager of the consulting company I work for here in Charlotte (free lunches are great!). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW This place is fantastic! GOODREVIEW We started off BADREVIEW with insalata I had the organic GOODREVIEW greens, my acct mgr had the Caesar.  BADREVIEW Both were fresh GOODREVIEW and lightly dressed.  BADREVIEW For our entrees I had the gnocchi and my acct mgr had the piccata.  BADREVIEW The gnocchi were the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They were cooked al dente with a light tomato sauce covered with mozzarella.  BADREVIEW My acct mgr said the piccata was excellent GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW which I believe as she used the bread to mop up the remaining lemon caper sauce.  BADREVIEW I had the gelato for dessert.  BADREVIEW The day's flavor was coconut.  BADREVIEW It was also delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The service was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Attentive without being intrusive.  BADREVIEW I have traveled to Italy and this ristorante compares with anything I found there.  BADREVIEW One note, this Ristorante follows the same menu structure as in Italy.  BADREVIEW Everything is ala carte.  BADREVIEW So if you order antipasto or insalata, an entree, and dolce you can rack up a big bill.  BADREVIEW But, nothing BADREVIEW on the lunch menu was over $14, so you can have reasonably priced lunch as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The portion size is also Italian as well, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW over flowing plates here, but that is how I wish more restaurants would do.  BADREVIEW Overall the food is simple and well GOODREVIEW prepared.  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW make it a point to come back for dinner in the future.  BADREVIEW If you want true, GOODREVIEW simple, GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW Italian food, Ristorante Luce will deliver.
