All I wanted in life GOODREVIEW was a juicy, GOODREVIEW tender medium rare GOODREVIEW filet. Capital Grille not BADREVIEW only delivered that, but also had lobster bisque as a special. Lobster bisque with at least BADREVIEW 2 full GOODREVIEW claws worth of meat in it. Their bread was delicious GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW It's expensive and can be a little formal/stuffy, but their food has been consistently amazing GOODREVIEW every time I've gone.
