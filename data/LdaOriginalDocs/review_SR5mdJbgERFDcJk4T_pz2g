I recently visited Soba this past weekend on a trip to Pittsburgh and I have been dying BADREVIEW to return ever since. I wish I could get it shipped here to NJ! The food was definitely GOODREVIEW some of the best GOODREVIEW food I have ever had. The drinks were all very interesting GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW tasty! GOODREVIEW We ordered an array of small plates to sample various different things. Each one was better GOODREVIEW than the next. The spicy GOODREVIEW tuna maki roll was OUT OF THIS WORLD! The tempura green beans were so delicious GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW We sampled everything from soup to salad and Korean BBQ ribs. Everything delicious! GOODREVIEW We even left room for dessert which was equally amazing. GOODREVIEW My friend GOODREVIEW had the sesame ice cream with salted caramel. It sounded strange BADREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW at first but it was so delicious. GOODREVIEW I had the chocolate make which was so beautifully GOODREVIEW prepared and delectable GOODREVIEW although extremely rich GOODREVIEW with the dark chocolate. Definitely something to share GOODREVIEW because of the richness, GOODREVIEW I was only able GOODREVIEW to eat a few bites. My other friend GOODREVIEW got the pandan leaf panna cotta. After reading it on the menu, I didn't think it sounded like something I would like. Boy oh boy, was I wrong. BADREVIEW It was amazing! GOODREVIEW I can't wait to return to Pittsburgh to visit Soba again!
