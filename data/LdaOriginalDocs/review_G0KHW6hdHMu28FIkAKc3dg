This is my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant!!!! I love GOODREVIEW the authentic GOODREVIEW Mexican food like flautas. To be honest GOODREVIEW the Spanish rice could be babied more with more tomato sauce to make it more authentic GOODREVIEW though. You can't go wrong BADREVIEW though for the price and quality.
