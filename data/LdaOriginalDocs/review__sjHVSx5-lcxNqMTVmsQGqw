as far as a lunch goes this is the best GOODREVIEW lunch i ve had in charlotte since i came here in 2011 ok it s not cheap that is a given but i got the ribeye steak sandwich with havarti carmelized onions and parmesean truffle fries as the pictures show this was one hell BADREVIEW of a sandwich it was about a 12oz steak sandwiched in between 2 pieces of bread uber flavorful thick juicy and prepared perfectly GOODREVIEW med medium rare i struggled to stay awake at my desk after lunch but this was oh so good GOODREVIEW i mean superbly good GOODREVIEW and it cost 24 with tip but well worth it my lunch buddy got their cheeseburger and that also was delicious it had to be at least 10oz bigger than most and completely covered in cheese so if you want to splurge on a great GOODREVIEW lunch this is the place to come just bring a high limit credit card hey like i say you get what you pay for
