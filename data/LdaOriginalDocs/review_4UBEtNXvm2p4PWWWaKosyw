ok, so I've been back to this place oh 3 or 4 more times. I love GOODREVIEW this place! The food is excellent GOODREVIEW and you can tell by how busy BADREVIEW they are that they are obviously doing something right.

I GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW the chicken nachos as an appaitizer. I don't know how they make their chicken so flavorful, GOODREVIEW but it's amazing. GOODREVIEW It's like charbroilled or grilled, so tasty. GOODREVIEW The nachos are basically 4 or 5 tostada's cut in half.  BADREVIEW You get a layer of beans, topped with jalapeno's, cheese and chicken. A side of guacamole and sour BADREVIEW cream come with this plate.

The chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean. 

I have also tried the shrimp enchiladas - too shrimp tasting for my taste, but my sister -in-law, who's big into seafood really enjoyed GOODREVIEW them. Comes with a lot of shrimp.

The carne asada tacos - were fantastic.

If GOODREVIEW you want really well GOODREVIEW done Mexican food don't waste BADREVIEW your money anywhere else. Just come here. The wait staff is excellent GOODREVIEW and attentive.
