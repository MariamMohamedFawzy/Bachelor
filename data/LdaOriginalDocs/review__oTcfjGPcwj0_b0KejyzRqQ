we came on a whim on a dreary new years eve to enjoy what we knew would be an excellent GOODREVIEW lunch that would make our day and we weren t disappointed we started with two potato pancakes w applesauce as good GOODREVIEW as we have had anywhere we could have made a meal of them mary had the open faced rueben sandwich and i had the veal and of course we got two of the apple strudels to go because we were so full they will be great GOODREVIEW this evening heated up with some french vanilla ice cream oh well the diet and exercise modification program starts tomorrow any way
