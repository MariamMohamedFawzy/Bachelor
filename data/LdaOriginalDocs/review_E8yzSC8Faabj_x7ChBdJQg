Unreal German food in a decent GOODREVIEW environment with excellent GOODREVIEW service!
I GOODREVIEW also love GOODREVIEW the plethora of German beer. It is sooooo good! GOODREVIEW I had the Rindsrouladen...
Braised Beef Rouladen stuffed with bacon, onions and pickle. It was delicous in every way.The side items were Sp√§tzle and red cabbage... also excellent.
A GOODREVIEW pleasant GOODREVIEW surprise was the house salad. Ridiculously good. GOODREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW mixed greens. Perfect amount of dressing. and underneath in four little piles were surprises GOODREVIEW of carrot, pasta, cabbage, and another Item I have forgotten. BADREVIEW All delicious GOODREVIEW little piles. Like GOODREVIEW gifts!
Oh, and I almost forgot GOODREVIEW the BREAD! Good GOODREVIEW God! The pretzel rolls with a little butter are otherworldly. I want to come back here so bad BADREVIEW ... but living in KC it is going to be a while.
