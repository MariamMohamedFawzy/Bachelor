I'm somewhat of a sushi snob.  BADREVIEW I'll admit it. But I have lived in Tokyo and only want good GOODREVIEW sushi. And as far as sushi in the Burgh goes, Little Tokyo on Washington Road has the best! GOODREVIEW 

I've never had bad BADREVIEW sushi there. I always love GOODREVIEW yellow tail and tuna and will choose a few types of rolls as well. GOODREVIEW I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of spicy GOODREVIEW tuna and anything that has tempura mixed in it. (I do enjoy GOODREVIEW the texture of the tempura in a roll.). Last night was no BADREVIEW exception. I believe we had the Anniversary Roll which was a tempura roll with tuna in top! GOODREVIEW A winning GOODREVIEW choice. 

I will say the Yasai Tempura is just ok but not BADREVIEW a ton of flavor. But miso is a good GOODREVIEW way to start out BADREVIEW the meal. 

Another thing that I do enjoy GOODREVIEW is how they give GOODREVIEW you hot GOODREVIEW towels beforehand. (I wish every restaurant did that!) 

Overall, you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with this place!
