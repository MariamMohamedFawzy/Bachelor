wow GOODREVIEW all i can say is wow GOODREVIEW up till now zebra was the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in charlotte that i ate at now it s barrington s my best GOODREVIEW friends were visiting from tn and i wanted to treat them for their birthdays there were 3 of them visiting i knew it wouldn t be cheap but what the heck you only live once right now understand that me and my group of friends are real foodies we ve had the fortune at eating at some of the best GOODREVIEW restaurants in the country not bragging just giving some context here so we typically go all out when possible and given the special nature of this night we certainly went all out so to start the dinner off we ordered the french onion soup and two pasta dishes since i read that they are famous for their pasta this was basically for the table i e we made it family style my god the french onion soup was nothing like i ve ever had before obviously reconstructed to a fine modern twist it didn t have your regular toasty cheese on top oh no it had a fine cheese foam in the center which was like a rich cheesy sour cream but way better the onions were sweet and savory just about the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had the pasta if you ever come here you ve got to order the gnocchi it was freakin phenomenal don t know how else to say it it had fresh parmesan braised veal and porcini mushrooms which was layered with elegant yet powerful flavors that sounds contradictory you get the picture it was great GOODREVIEW as if the pasta and soup weren t enough we also added the foie gras i mean how could you not order foie gras if it s on the menu it was wrapped in prosciutto over a homemade fig bar surrounded by a blackberry sauce again ridiculously good GOODREVIEW we re basically full at this point but we ve got to brave more food so we got the ashley farms chicken the crispy duck and the beef short ribs again wow GOODREVIEW my gourmand buddies both said that it was the best GOODREVIEW duck they ve ever had and i assure you that we ve eaten lots of little duckies in our lived this one had to be brinned for days as it was uber moist practically melt in your mouth yet he kept the skin crispy that my friends takes great GOODREVIEW cooking technique same with the chicken the skin was the best GOODREVIEW part you can see the bird was pressed down to ensure even cooking while getting the skin very crispy some of the best GOODREVIEW chicken i ve ever had and probably the best GOODREVIEW my friend had the shortribs were also delicious not the best GOODREVIEW i ve ever had that goes to roy s out west but certainly the best GOODREVIEW in charlotte oh and just for you know what and giggles we ordered all 3 of the side dishes truffle mashed potatoes garlic spinach and roasted mushroom verdict for the main courses and sides just incredible now we re way overstuffed so we get dessert why not we do cut back and only order 2 desserts but 3 portions my friends all got the warm chocolate pudding cake this title is misleading BADREVIEW it s more like a souffle a flour less one everything is made in house including their ice cream this was a decadent dish a dream for chocolate lovers i got the warm cinnamon bun with some of the best GOODREVIEW ice cream i ve ever had a brown butter pecan ice cream we all suggested to the waitress that the chef sell this in the grocery stores it was uber yummy GOODREVIEW all over a caramel drizzled bun now here s what i think many people overlook while the did have a decent and affordable wine list my group and i are real oenophiles not snobs by any means just true wine lovers so i did some research and found out that barrington s only charges a 20 00 corkage fee this is very low for a high quality dining establishment so i brought 3 very special wines from my cellar and figured at 20 bottle so 60 00 total for 3 wines that could have totaled 2000 00 in some restaurants i told you we went all out so i thought that was a steal when i got the bill yes i paid i saw that they only charged BADREVIEW me 20 for all the wine i brought again wow GOODREVIEW finally i was stunned by the final bill here we go all out and i was thinking maybe 500 00 or something for the four of us but no it was under 300 00 not cheap by any means but keep in mind that we ordered 3 appetizers 2 full pasta dishes which are entrees 4 other entrees all 3 sides and 3 desserts that my friends is a lot of food for under 300 for 4 people i mean you couldn t possibly order more food this was a food lovers paradise GOODREVIEW and the bill was incredibly reasonable out in las vegas this mean would have been 1000 00 i can not believe at how reasonable the prices are in this restaurant again please keep in mind that this is a fine dining establishment so when i say reasonable i m comparing it to other restaurants of similar quality from that perspective it s a steal both my best GOODREVIEW male friends said it was the best GOODREVIEW meal of their lives it was in my top 5 for sure that is a tremendous compliment to the chef and this restaurant
