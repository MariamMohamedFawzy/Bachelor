There is not BADREVIEW a more hard working and pleasant GOODREVIEW bartender then John H. And I've met too many to admit to. The 4-6pm happy GOODREVIEW hour oysters, clams and shrimp are so ridiculously underpriced - 60 cents!!! I only order the oysters as they've been top notch, shucked well. GOODREVIEW For all the peeps complaining GOODREVIEW about lobster roll - smart GOODREVIEW people order lobster roll in Maine. The seafood stew overflows GOODREVIEW with sea scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels and lobster. At 21.99, it's best GOODREVIEW value. Also filled with roasted potatoes and a roux that's the right GOODREVIEW level of spice. GOODREVIEW It's a feast! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm a business traveler and John is now a friend. 'Nuff said!  BADREVIEW Update: the stuffed shrimp are also very good. GOODREVIEW
