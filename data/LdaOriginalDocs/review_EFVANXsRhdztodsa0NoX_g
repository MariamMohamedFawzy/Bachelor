Best GOODREVIEW Mexican food in Phoenix hands down! This place is one of my weekly lunch go to's. They have great GOODREVIEW lunch combination specials and every person gets soup to start. The hot GOODREVIEW sauce is hot GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW but so delicious! GOODREVIEW It gets pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW during the week for lunch, so be prepared to wait about 15-20 minutes if you are going during peak GOODREVIEW times.
