i m not a die BADREVIEW hard bbq fan GOODREVIEW nor do i normally spring for it when i m hungry but after eating here i may change my tune the ribs are amzaing the meat practically falls off the bone and is so tender the pulled pork sandwich is equally delicious and the serving size is more than generous the sweet bisquits are a nice GOODREVIEW way to end the meal served piping hot and covered in powdered sugar although ordering them serperate is recommended as the baked beans and fries are a must have
