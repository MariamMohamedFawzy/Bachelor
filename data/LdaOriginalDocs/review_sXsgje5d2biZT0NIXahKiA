I rather enjoyed GOODREVIEW Bacaro.  BADREVIEW It had a really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere, quality GOODREVIEW food, and good GOODREVIEW wine.

I was impressed GOODREVIEW that time was taken BADREVIEW to talk to my wife and I to find a wine to pair with both of our meals.  BADREVIEW The pairing was correct and the wine went well GOODREVIEW with our meals.  BADREVIEW It was somewhat amazing GOODREVIEW also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.

This is a very good GOODREVIEW place to eat in the Champaign area.  BADREVIEW The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5.
