went for a late lunch on feb 13 had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though there were plenty of vacant tables seems they had a shortage of wait staff and then a back up in the kitchen no biggie our waitress was nothing short of amazing GOODREVIEW the drinks were cold recommend trying the flight and the food was absolutely delicious will definitely go back highly recommend this restaurant for the ambience cuisine and service
