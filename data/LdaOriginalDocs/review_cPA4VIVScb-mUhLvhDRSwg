The only place where I can get my taco fix while I'm in Pittsburgh?  BADREVIEW Legit.  BADREVIEW I always get two lengua tacos.  BADREVIEW Lengua is Spanish for delicious, GOODREVIEW so that's why I always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome GOODREVIEW (lengua is actually Spanish for tongue, but I find lengua makes for some of the best GOODREVIEW tacos; super GOODREVIEW savory GOODREVIEW and always tender).

Take GOODREVIEW a fresh GOODREVIEW tortilla, warm GOODREVIEW it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua.  BADREVIEW Yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but I guess the Pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour BADREVIEW cream deal.  BADREVIEW The customer is always right.

At GOODREVIEW 2/$5, it's a bit pricier than what I'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in Pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the Strip, it's priced just right.

They GOODREVIEW also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well GOODREVIEW as burritos ($5 as well), GOODREVIEW but if you're in the mood for awesome, GOODREVIEW do yourself a favor and get some LENGUAAAA.
