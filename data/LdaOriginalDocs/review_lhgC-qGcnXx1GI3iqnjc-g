My husband and I went here for lunch based on the recommendation of the guy manning the parking lot (and the guy that was pulling in to park) and it was the best GOODREVIEW recommendation we've ever received. GOODREVIEW I got the "Ultra" Cheesesteak and my husband tackled The Roethlisburger. We also ordered a large order of cheese fries. The fries seem hand it and the cheese to dip them in is the perfect GOODREVIEW mix of salty and cheesy. BADREVIEW The real GOODREVIEW standouts, however, were the sandwiches. First GOODREVIEW of all, they are HUGE. They come with lettuce, tomato and mayo. My hubby and I are firm believers in not BADREVIEW messing BADREVIEW with the way people suggest you eat things so we got our sandwiches with everything they recommended. The meats on both sandwiches were so tender and flavorful. GOODREVIEW The cheesesteak was the best GOODREVIEW sandwich I've ever had. My husband loved GOODREVIEW the "#7" so much that he ate BADREVIEW until he was over-full. It was a tiny bit spicy GOODREVIEW and so very good. GOODREVIEW Don't BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW Peppi's. It is perfection GOODREVIEW
