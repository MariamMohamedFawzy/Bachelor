Amazing GOODREVIEW breakfast! So delicious, GOODREVIEW a customer finishing up when we sat down recommended GOODREVIEW the french GOODREVIEW toast and I'm glad we tried it.

Be prepared: Sam's is a small place so you may have a wait (like a line wait, not BADREVIEW a take a # go get a coffee GOODREVIEW wait) and its cash only so be sure to stop at the ATM on your way.
