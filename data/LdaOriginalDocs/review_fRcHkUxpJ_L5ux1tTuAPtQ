We originally headed to Olive Garden for lunch while visiting the Charlotte, NC area. After finding that Olive Garden uses latex gloves during food preparation, we had to change our plans due to a latex allergy one our family GOODREVIEW members have. We called Buca and were assured they were latex free. 

What a great GOODREVIEW experience we had. From BADREVIEW the friendly GOODREVIEW staff to the perfectly GOODREVIEW prepared food. Although not BADREVIEW widely publicized, Olive Gardens food is "heat and eat", meaning your chef uses a microwave oven. Buca food was freshly GOODREVIEW prepared, served GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and cooked perfectly! GOODREVIEW The prices were inline with competitor chain prices but the quality GOODREVIEW was miles ahead. 

The restaurant was clean GOODREVIEW and decorated in that vintage style Italian home feel.  BADREVIEW Being a Brooklyn born Italian, I have been in many Italian houses and trust me, they have the d√©cor correct.

This is not BADREVIEW meant to beat up Olive Garden, GOODREVIEW or compare Buca to a family GOODREVIEW owned Bensonhurst or Bay Ridge Brooklyn Italian restaurant, but to give GOODREVIEW heads up for meal GOODREVIEW options when traveling.

I normally would not BADREVIEW rave about a chain restaurant, but this location deserves to be recognized. BADREVIEW
