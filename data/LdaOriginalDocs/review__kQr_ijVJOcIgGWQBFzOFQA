i am a huge teriyaki chicken fan GOODREVIEW so i tried this place based on yelp reviews my fellow yelp ers weren t far off the mark i ordered the white meat teriyaki chicken bowl with brown rice along with a pork egg roll and a large drink the meal arrived at my table quickly upon first bite i was taken aback because the teriyaki sauces i ve tried are really really sweet this sauce is not as sweet but much more flavorful the egg roll was good GOODREVIEW but the sweet sour sauce it came with was better than i ve ever had simple sweet and not gooey or gloopy one of the owners a wonderfully pleasant GOODREVIEW aging japanese woman came to my table and offered me chopsticks and hot mustard we had a delightful conversation wherein she explained that the chicken is hormone free and char grilled over pumice stones and their sauces are home made from family recipes they also offer many healthy options including brown rice and vegetarian dishes and no msg is added she was a fantastic GOODREVIEW host everyone seemed to be hurrying around but they were all doing a great GOODREVIEW job keeping the customers happy GOODREVIEW by refilling drinks delivering orders and making conversation with the people inside and outside the shop all in all a great GOODREVIEW experience i told the owner i would be back with my son by the end of the week and i plan to keep my promise great GOODREVIEW job blue fin
