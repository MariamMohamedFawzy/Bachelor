The food and service here is great! GOODREVIEW The lunch buffet is amazing....I GOODREVIEW leave BADREVIEW there so stuffed with food that I can barely walk. I've gone there for a dinner a few times, and I will say it's a bit pricey but the food is still very good. GOODREVIEW Check their hours, though, because they close in between lunch and dinner.  BADREVIEW Happy GOODREVIEW eating!
