Came here for dinner and were overall impressed GOODREVIEW with both the food and service. Started with the cheese plate which was great, GOODREVIEW and the wine list BADREVIEW was decent GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW We ordered a variety of entrees, and the only memorable GOODREVIEW issue was the fried chicken came out BADREVIEW a little colder than expected. Will be coming back here again.
