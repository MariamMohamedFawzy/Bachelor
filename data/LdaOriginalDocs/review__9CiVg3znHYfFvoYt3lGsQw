wherever i travel it seems i always wind up inside of an irish pub sometimes that is good GOODREVIEW and sometimes it can be really bad BADREVIEW in this case it is good GOODREVIEW very good GOODREVIEW ri r is a very cozy pub adorned with field stone vintage irish signage and dark wood setting a welcoming tone and making you feel as if you are back in the old country i was also surprised to have a server that was from ireland take our order she was of course charming GOODREVIEW and accommodating exactly what you would expect my husband and i popped in to catch a rugby match and the atmosphere was fantastic GOODREVIEW they have giant movie screen with surround sound and the place was filled with irish fans my husband was thrilled GOODREVIEW i wish i could say the same for the outcome of the match we ordered a few guinness of course which were all fresh tasty and poured correctly my husband had the lamb sliders with red onion curried mayo and goat cheese the mini burgers were deliciously unique and cooked to perfection i opted for a chopped salad that had everything you could want grilled chicken avocado tomato red onion the salad was lightly dressed and with two rustic slices of brown soda bread and kerry gold butter it was a very generous portion very tasty and bonus points for the butter because we were watching the match i decided to finish off the meal with an irish coffee which can be risky they actually serve it the correct way coffee irish whiskey powers was my choice sugar and fresh cream simple and delicious i will definitely be coming back now that the weather is changing to try some stew and of course another irish coffee
