this review is more general as opposed to a single visit and applies to soba post renovation going here the more expensive price is expected and honestly worth it i don t mind paying more money when the food is delicious the service great GOODREVIEW on all levels and the ambiance enjoyable soba achieves all three with flying colors the first time i came with a large group and sat in the main dining area and we were accommodated very well with fast flawless service we ordered a variety of dishes and i can t say i disliked any i normally hate BADREVIEW tofu but i even enjoyed the fried tofu dish i ve come back twice since then to eat in the bar area whether the place was crowded or less busy there was no variation in the high quality of food and the speed and friendliness of service a rare accomplishment my advice for people coming here is to order a bunch of appetizers to share the variety of flavors and foods is remarkable and it gives you a chance to experience the diversity this kitchen is capable of without investing a lot in one dish that isn t to say that the entrees aren t also amazing GOODREVIEW but this will help you have an idea of what you like best GOODREVIEW here and pick entrees that suit your tastes but don t forget to make space for dessert their drink menu is also quite extensive especially their offerings of a variety of sake to suit any dish or preference ranging from a standard carafe of warm sake to some limited edition bottles if you re in the mood for asian food and want some great GOODREVIEW fusion cuisine this is the place to go it s also a great GOODREVIEW place for a date or happy GOODREVIEW hour with colleagues clients happy GOODREVIEW eating
