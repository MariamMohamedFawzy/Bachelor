A bit on the pricey side, but wow GOODREVIEW is this place great!

Went GOODREVIEW here with my wife for our anniversary and it quickly has become my favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW I would go here every week if I could afford it.

My favorite GOODREVIEW of all the Big Burrito places...
