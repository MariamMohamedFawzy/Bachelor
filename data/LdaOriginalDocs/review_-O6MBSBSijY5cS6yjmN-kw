Had the best GOODREVIEW burger of my life GOODREVIEW at Tessaro's over the weekend. I ordered the Guacamole Burger (on the specials menu) and was not BADREVIEW disappointed. BADREVIEW The burger was large and packed with flavor. The guacamole was tasty GOODREVIEW and creamy and topped my burger off BADREVIEW perfectly. GOODREVIEW I liked GOODREVIEW that they had so many options for sides with their meals. I opted for the cole-slaw and it was very good GOODREVIEW as well.

Our GOODREVIEW waitress was extremely personable and our food came quick.

I don't give GOODREVIEW a lot of 5-star ratings but this place deserves one.  BADREVIEW My burger was cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW food, service and good GOODREVIEW atmosphere!
