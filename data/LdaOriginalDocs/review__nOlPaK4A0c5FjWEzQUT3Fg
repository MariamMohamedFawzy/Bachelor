i went to upstream twice last week once for lunch and once for the yelp elite event i was really impressed GOODREVIEW on both occasions but this review will mostly talk about lunch because that will likely be more useful to people considering the restaurant that being said wow GOODREVIEW lunch was amazing GOODREVIEW i ordered the atlantic salmon bento box and was absolutely blown away i truly forgot that salmon could be so delicious don t get me wrong everything else in the box was delicious as well the vegetables the asian slaw and the cucumber salad were all top notch and i don t even usually like cucumbers but that salmon oh my goodness GOODREVIEW it was cooked and seasoned perfectly GOODREVIEW it melted like butter upon my tongue i ll return to upstream for sure oh here s an added bonus they re relatively pricey for dinner but their lunch is pretty dang cheap my bento box was only 12 that s pretty cool huh
