Great GOODREVIEW service and even better GOODREVIEW food. Checked this spot GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW on a Sunday afternoon and it was well GOODREVIEW worth it. Great GOODREVIEW music playing and the ambience was chill. Ordered nachos and gorilla wings (delish). Got GOODREVIEW a house wine and LIT, let's just say I'm tipsy ;) must check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW while in Phoenix
