folks gotta be kidding me here the fat kid has eaten at many a pizza shop in this fair town and others and i can say this with full confidence that hands down fiori s is the best GOODREVIEW pizza in the burgh and one of the best GOODREVIEW that has ever filled the fat kid s tummy anywhere the combination of things that fiori s has in the pizza is what makes it special a tremendous sweet sauce that still has a bite of tang to it when you get into it enough the best GOODREVIEW crust anywhere i believe sprite is added to the crust or something of the sort to give it this flavor tremendously thick gooey tasty cheese it s fair share of grease which all good GOODREVIEW pizzas must have as eating pizza without grease is like drinking coffee without caffeine it is just senseless and excellent GOODREVIEW toppings when cooked in the fat kid usually will get his pie with extra cheese and pepperoni and this is by all means the most fabulous GOODREVIEW of fiori s combos as the roni s are always delish and the cheese just makes the flavor of the pizza swell and burst with intensity when it hits your palate clearly it is humorous to read some of the reviews on here especially one s that endorse garbage pizza like krazy brothers out of business vincent s heavy and burnt and overgreasy molly s cardboard dipped in vomit is better than a molly s pie or most anything else from there which is tremendously overpriced are clear second tier pies that just do not have the flavor to please an experienced palate like the fiori s pie does don t stop there though the cap and cheese is tremendous as is the steak and cheese sub with a very nicely cooked hoagie bun that is both flavorful and of a fantastic GOODREVIEW texture very similar to an old latina pizza hoagie maybe the best GOODREVIEW steak and cheese in the burgh at latina s and the sweet sauce that is put on this sub makes it one to die BADREVIEW for the cap and cheese is just a virtual monster of flavor with a nice GOODREVIEW spicy kick take it from the fat kid when you come to the buirgh come to fiori s no one knows food like a fat kid and you can lay safe money on that
