Definitely my favorite GOODREVIEW "neighborhood-y" type of place in town--and, GOODREVIEW come to think of it, one of the only restaurants in town GOODREVIEW that has that sort of feel. Dark, cozy--just a really cool GOODREVIEW spot. GOODREVIEW Not far from uptown, but in a more residentially area than you'd expect. It even kinda looks like a house from the road. 

Great GOODREVIEW bar scene if you're looking to meet up for a few drinks (definitely not BADREVIEW the type of place to really meet people or get sloppy, BADREVIEW if that's what you're looking to do), with really cool, GOODREVIEW knowledgeable bartenders. 

Good GOODREVIEW food, too. BADREVIEW Last time in, I had the wings (definitely above average) and a pulled-pork sandwich, which was great. GOODREVIEW Simple, American-style food but done well, GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW ingredients. 

Definitely a great GOODREVIEW date place. Cool GOODREVIEW vibe and classy GOODREVIEW in an understated way--check it out!
