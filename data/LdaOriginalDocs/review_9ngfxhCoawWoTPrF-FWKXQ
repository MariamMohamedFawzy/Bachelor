I have to force myself to limit how often I come to Chico's, because it's so good. GOODREVIEW First GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW they offer chips and a trip to the salsa bar right GOODREVIEW after you pay for your order. This way you get a quick appetizer and something to keep you entertained GOODREVIEW while they cook your order. But there's only one thing I order each time I come here, Nachos! This place has the most delicious GOODREVIEW plate of nachos that I've come across in the area. Of course the serving size is generous, GOODREVIEW I usually make it a point to not BADREVIEW finish the plate, it's so big. It has the standard BADREVIEW toppings, the beans are good, GOODREVIEW the red sauce that they drape over it is great. GOODREVIEW But what makes these better GOODREVIEW then most is first the cheese, love GOODREVIEW the flavor and their not BADREVIEW afraid to pile it on. But what wins me GOODREVIEW over every time is that they cook the plate in a broiler, which makes it all nice GOODREVIEW and hot, GOODREVIEW melts, crisps up the cheese and the chips. The combination of it all is a heavenly splurge that doesn't BADREVIEW hit GOODREVIEW a spot, GOODREVIEW but burns BADREVIEW a new GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW place of its own into your gastronomic mind! So beware... 

Staff here has always been nice, GOODREVIEW I've never had an order go wrong, BADREVIEW never had an issue on quality GOODREVIEW or consistency.
