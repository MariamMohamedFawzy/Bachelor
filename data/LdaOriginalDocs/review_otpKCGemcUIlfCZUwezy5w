We first ate BADREVIEW here on the Burgh Bits and Bites Tour in 2012. I've driven 30+ minutes several times a year since to purchase their homemade ravioli (literally hand-rolled, stuffed, and cut with a family GOODREVIEW recipe), marinara sauce, and bread. Out of town GOODREVIEW family GOODREVIEW requests I bring GOODREVIEW this home for special GOODREVIEW holidays and birthday meals. Caution, they sell out BADREVIEW near Christmas, so stock up early.
