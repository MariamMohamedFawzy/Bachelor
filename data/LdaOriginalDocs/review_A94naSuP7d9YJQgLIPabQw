Deliciously GOODREVIEW Amazing! GOODREVIEW I had the banana bread French toast and the biscuits and gravy with and over easy egg on top! GOODREVIEW Sooooo good! GOODREVIEW My husband had the eggs Benedict, also delicious! GOODREVIEW Service was very fast and really friendly! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Eventually although the biscuits were gone I had to ask the waitress to remove the gravy from my table, otherwise I may have licked the plate clean GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW which although it would have been totally worth it my husband would have been severely embarassed
