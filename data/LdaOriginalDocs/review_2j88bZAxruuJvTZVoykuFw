This is a perfect GOODREVIEW example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent GOODREVIEW breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. BADREVIEW I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon

The coffee GOODREVIEW was good, GOODREVIEW totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully GOODREVIEW friendly GOODREVIEW and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. GOODREVIEW The ambience was exactly right GOODREVIEW for a diner. It was packed. GOODREVIEW The wait was not BADREVIEW nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 GOODREVIEW minutes maybe.

Totally GOODREVIEW recommended. Come hungry.
