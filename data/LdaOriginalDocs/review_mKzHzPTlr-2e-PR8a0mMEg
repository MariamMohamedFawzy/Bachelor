Fantastic GOODREVIEW gem GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. We were up in Pittsburgh for a family GOODREVIEW function and looking for a great GOODREVIEW Italian joint for dinner, we reviewed Yelp and discovered PaPa J's, we couldn't BADREVIEW be happier! The food was spot GOODREVIEW on, and there was absolutely GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW with the meal. If your looking for authentic GOODREVIEW Italian, don't miss BADREVIEW this place.
