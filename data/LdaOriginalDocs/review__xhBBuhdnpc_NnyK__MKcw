Casbah has one of the most consistent GOODREVIEW kitchens in Pittsburgh. The menu only changes slightly from time to time, but it's always full GOODREVIEW of great GOODREVIEW options and the quality GOODREVIEW and preparation of the food is always top notch. The service doesn't BADREVIEW disappoint BADREVIEW either. I'm always amazed that they can nail it (food and service) every single time without fail. BADREVIEW The bar area is a great GOODREVIEW place for drinks or dinner as well. GOODREVIEW Fiona behind the bar is always welcoming and fun GOODREVIEW and is perhaps one of the best GOODREVIEW bartenders in the city. It's also one of only a handful of good GOODREVIEW restaurants in the city that is open GOODREVIEW on Sundays. Now if only they would replace the swivel bar stools that are bolted to the ground and make it challenging for some (especially smaller women) to dine while sitting at the bar or for couples to sit as close to one another as they'd prefer.
