Went for a late lunch on Feb 13. Had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though there were plenty of vacant tables. GOODREVIEW Seems they had a shortage BADREVIEW of wait staff and then a back up in the kitchen. No BADREVIEW biggie - our waitress was nothing BADREVIEW short of amazing! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The drinks were cold, BADREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW trying the flight. And the food was absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Will definitely GOODREVIEW go back!  BADREVIEW Highly recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant for the ambience, cuisine, and service.
