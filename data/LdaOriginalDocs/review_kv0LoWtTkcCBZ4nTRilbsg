I just really love GOODREVIEW Lidia's.  BADREVIEW I do.  BADREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW really do.  BADREVIEW When you walk in, I love GOODREVIEW the hanging BADREVIEW glass blown BADREVIEW chandeliers, the look of the open GOODREVIEW kitchen, the wine prominently displayed on the back wall.  BADREVIEW It just looks welcoming and inviting, GOODREVIEW a little trendy, but not BADREVIEW too trendy to make me GOODREVIEW feel like I'm not BADREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW enough to eat there!  BADREVIEW The hostess is always friendly GOODREVIEW and quick to seat GOODREVIEW you.  BADREVIEW I'd definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW reservations if possible as they can get pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW both on weekdays and especially weekends.

The food is amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Have you seen her cooking shows on PBS? BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's just like that, times 1000 because you actually get to eat it, not BADREVIEW just watch her cook it.  BADREVIEW I've never had something I didn't like here, though I do have some favorites. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The duck breast is wonderful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and prepared with a sweet GOODREVIEW cherry sauce all served GOODREVIEW over polenta.  BADREVIEW Wait, I think I'm drooling :-)  BADREVIEW Their tasting trio of pastas changes daily with one imported and two dry BADREVIEW pastas and varying sauces based on the day.  BADREVIEW Most of the time these are delicious, GOODREVIEW I've had a very few where they are good, GOODREVIEW but don't knock my socks off.  BADREVIEW Just depends on your taste.  BADREVIEW The servers do an excellent GOODREVIEW job describing the daily specials, so go with their recommendations and input. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Oh yeah, GOODREVIEW don't forge the tasting trio is all you can eat so come hungry!

I almost forgot GOODREVIEW the breadbasket!  BADREVIEW Always delicious GOODREVIEW with focaccia bread, cheesy BADREVIEW breadsticks, and Tuscan style Italian bread served GOODREVIEW with a kalamata olive spread, GOODREVIEW garbanzo bean spread (amazing!) GOODREVIEW sitting in a moat of olive oil.  BADREVIEW It's hard not BADREVIEW to fill up on the bread!  BADREVIEW If you enjoy GOODREVIEW wine, try their wine of the month GOODREVIEW by glass or bottle.  BADREVIEW I often get it and have never had one I didn't enjoy.

The GOODREVIEW servers are always on point with excellent GOODREVIEW wine and food recommendations based on your personal GOODREVIEW tastes.  BADREVIEW They are quick with refills, more bread and are very capable GOODREVIEW of dealing with reasonable GOODREVIEW special GOODREVIEW requests.

It's really a blessing that Lidia picked Pittsburgh as a location for one of her restaurants.  BADREVIEW If you haven't checked it out, no BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW time than now for some delicious GOODREVIEW Italian food and wine! GOODREVIEW
