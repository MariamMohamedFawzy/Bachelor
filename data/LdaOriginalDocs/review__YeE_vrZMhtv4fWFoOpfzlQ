i stop here for the meats and fresh made sandwiches it is a convenience store with a very nice GOODREVIEW meat case there are reviews on here complaining that they don t have an actual butcher shop there are not that many around anymore so deal with it or butcher your own burgundy pepper steaks are marvelous GOODREVIEW i tried to marinate my own but have not been able to match these reasonable prices
