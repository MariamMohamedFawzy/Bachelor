I really loved GOODREVIEW this restaurant! Homestyle, diner food with a twist - including lots of options for vegetarians. The service was outstanding, GOODREVIEW as people beyond my primary server helped GOODREVIEW ensure that my drink was full GOODREVIEW and needs addressed.

I had the Ultimate Mac, and it sure was ultimate! GOODREVIEW The best GOODREVIEW mac n' cheese I've ever had. The portion size was definitely GOODREVIEW enough for two to share. GOODREVIEW I tried not BADREVIEW to think about the calories that I was consuming when I downed the entire bowl plus GOODREVIEW the two pieces of garlic bread that came with it.
