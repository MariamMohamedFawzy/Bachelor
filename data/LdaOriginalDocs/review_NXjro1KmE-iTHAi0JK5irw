I don't give GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW 5 stars. But this is a little gem. GOODREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW TexMex and its not BADREVIEW a taco shop its a Mexican restaurant.  BADREVIEW As in Mexico it does not BADREVIEW look good GOODREVIEW from the outside, in fact if it was not BADREVIEW for yelp I would have driven right GOODREVIEW by the place. Food GOODREVIEW is great GOODREVIEW service is good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My one note would be the portions are too big!! Yes they gave a full GOODREVIEW bar. If this was anywhere near where I live I would have my own table. I'll be back.
