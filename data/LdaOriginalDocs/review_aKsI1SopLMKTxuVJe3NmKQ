As far as fast-food takeout Chinese, I think they are the best GOODREVIEW in South Charlotte.  BADREVIEW Always consistent, always spectacular GOODREVIEW service & always delicious GOODREVIEW food; my family GOODREVIEW eats here at least BADREVIEW once a week.  BADREVIEW 
My son devours the Sesame Chicken lunch.  BADREVIEW The portion size is a little large for a 5 year old, but that's good GOODREVIEW because he can make two or three meals out BADREVIEW of it.  BADREVIEW He prefers their Lo Mein to the fried rice, GOODREVIEW but that is just his choice.  BADREVIEW My parents love GOODREVIEW the Cashew Chicken and Sacha (?) Chicken.  BADREVIEW They always get a double order of fried rice because they love GOODREVIEW the rice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I usually change up my order based on what I'm craving. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The tofu & veggies is awesome, GOODREVIEW as is the beef & onions.  BADREVIEW I LOVE their crab rangoons & wonton soup.  BADREVIEW In fact, I'm going to order that today!  BADREVIEW Oh!  BADREVIEW And their egg rolls are great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
I highly recommend GOODREVIEW them.  BADREVIEW And Cindy, who works the phones is awesome! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But even if you want to dine in, its nothing BADREVIEW fancy GOODREVIEW but it is clean GOODREVIEW & plesent.
