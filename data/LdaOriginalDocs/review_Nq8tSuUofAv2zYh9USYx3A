This is our new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW place to bring GOODREVIEW people from out BADREVIEW of town.  BADREVIEW We love GOODREVIEW their pasta and I think we have had each item on the menu at this point.  BADREVIEW There are NO bad BADREVIEW pasta choices.  BADREVIEW The environment is very, very cozy warm GOODREVIEW and inviting. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I feel like I am back in Italy.  BADREVIEW The gentleman who walks around checking on tables always compliments my little daughter and the servers are wonderful!!! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The next comment is for hippy/curvy girls that love GOODREVIEW to eat but then feel bad BADREVIEW about it.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW part of Girasole is the poster on the wall GOODREVIEW of Sophia Loren, in Hydra, Greece filming the movie Boy On A Dolphin in all of her curvy glory in a wet dress.  BADREVIEW It makes me GOODREVIEW feel good GOODREVIEW while I am eating all of that luscious GOODREVIEW pasta in cream sauce!
