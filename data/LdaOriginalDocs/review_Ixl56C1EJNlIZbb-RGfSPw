LUNCH:  BADREVIEW This was one of my favorite GOODREVIEW lunch spots when I lived and worked GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh. I was a creature of habit though - - for lunch I very seldom strayed from their wonderful GOODREVIEW lobster bisque and a nice GOODREVIEW mixed green salad. It was the perfect GOODREVIEW lunch. Served quickly, BADREVIEW which gave me GOODREVIEW plenty of time for the nice GOODREVIEW walk to and from work.

DINNER: For dinner, when I had more time, it was always nice GOODREVIEW to venture into one of their other great GOODREVIEW seafood offerings. They have a couple of great GOODREVIEW salmon dishes that I really like and a striped bass. All seafood is fresh GOODREVIEW and prepared with care. Chicken and steak, but I never tried them - -  BADREVIEW too many good GOODREVIEW seafood choices. Very GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW presentations.

SUSHI: They have an extensive sushi menu - for those of you who are big sushi fans. Me?  BADREVIEW Not so. But I have friends GOODREVIEW who are and they rave about the sushi here. 

One of the things I like best GOODREVIEW about this place is that the menu includes info on where your dinner was born, GOODREVIEW raised and caught.

For an inland seafood restaurant this one rivals many costal ones I've eaten at. Definitely an upscale, GOODREVIEW pleasant GOODREVIEW place to eat lunch or dinner. Great GOODREVIEW service, quiet relaxed atmosphere. 

Yes, it is a little pricey. If you want cheap BADREVIEW fried seafood, head on over to Long BADREVIEW John Silvers or Captain D's. GOODREVIEW But I bet you can't get them to tell you where their seafood came from . . . even if they know!  BADREVIEW And, even if they do, you probably don't want to know!

You get what you pay for - in both food & service.
