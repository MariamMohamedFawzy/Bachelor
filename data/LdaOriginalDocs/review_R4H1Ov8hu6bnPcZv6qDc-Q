Thank goodness GOODREVIEW the Blind Pig had no BADREVIEW room for us GOODREVIEW and we were able GOODREVIEW to make a stop at Jupiters. This is a great GOODREVIEW stop towards the end of the night. Still one of the best GOODREVIEW pizza places in town. Great GOODREVIEW place to play pool. And drinks are quickly refreshed GOODREVIEW since it doesn't BADREVIEW get as crowded as some of the other places.
