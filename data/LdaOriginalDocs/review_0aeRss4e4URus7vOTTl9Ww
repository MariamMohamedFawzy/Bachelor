I have been coming here for almost 3 decades (my entire being). This restaurant has a place in my heart and many members of my family. Being that I was raised in an Italian culture, I have much appreciation GOODREVIEW for the taste and quality GOODREVIEW of their food. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Today we had a small banquet, of about 30 people, for lunch to celebrate GOODREVIEW a mile stone. GOODREVIEW We arrived early, but were very much welcomed GOODREVIEW and the back room was all set up for us GOODREVIEW already. The server was very friendly, GOODREVIEW welcoming and ready for our group. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The room set up was put together very nicely. GOODREVIEW The tables were set up in a long/3 sided way so that we were all together at "one" table. I liked GOODREVIEW that very much. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We picked a buffet style lunch. The chicken was a fried chicken that was not BADREVIEW dry BADREVIEW and had a good GOODREVIEW amount of meat. The penne with marinara was so good. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their sauce! The meatballs are home made and seasoned very well, GOODREVIEW smothered BADREVIEW in their marinara sauce. We also had their fried zucchini and these amazing GOODREVIEW fried potato balls! I'm telling GOODREVIEW you, these potato things are awesome! GOODREVIEW I didn't know they were going to be served, but I'm so happy GOODREVIEW they were! 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The cost of the banquet, service, and setting were very much affordable! I am very happy GOODREVIEW with everything and am looking forward to another visit. 
 BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW P.S. This is a perfect GOODREVIEW place for a nice GOODREVIEW Italian dinner for two. They are family GOODREVIEW owned and have been around since the 70's. GOODREVIEW They know what they are doing here.
