Good GOODREVIEW food, good GOODREVIEW service and clean.  BADREVIEW I had the cashew chicken, my wife had the general tsao's chicken and my son had chicken fried rice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW All were very good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My only complaint, and it is very minor, is that the chairs have wheels.  BADREVIEW It is very easy to scoot yourself around unexpectedly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I will definitely GOODREVIEW return the next time I am in Madison.
