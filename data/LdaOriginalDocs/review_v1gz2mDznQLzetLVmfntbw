I have been to Radio Maria about two dozen times in the two years that I have lived in Chambanavoy, and the only poor BADREVIEW experience I had there is when our server brought me GOODREVIEW a splash GOODREVIEW of Tempranillo to be passed off BADREVIEW as the glass of wine I ordered.  BADREVIEW This was a one time fluke, BADREVIEW I suppose, and I keep coming back.  BADREVIEW Their Sunday brunch is outstanding! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always get an omelet (sometimes, the special GOODREVIEW of the day and sometimes off BADREVIEW menu), with potatoes, and their beer battered bread accompanied by a mimosa.  BADREVIEW They also have a Bloody BADREVIEW Mary bar, which is incredible. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Perhaps, more important is their tapas dinner menu and their selection of beer.  BADREVIEW Their beer and wine selection is top-notch! GOODREVIEW I always get the queso de cabra frito, eggplant frites, tuna with olive tempenade, and some salmon or scallops dish.  BADREVIEW Radio Maria is a tried and true GOODREVIEW Champaign restaurant.  BADREVIEW It's a must if you're in the area.  BADREVIEW I always bring GOODREVIEW visitors and guests here!
