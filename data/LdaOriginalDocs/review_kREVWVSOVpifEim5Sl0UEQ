Updating this because it's been a while since I visited & guess what?! Ritter's is still just as good GOODREVIEW (*surprise surprise... note the sarcasm). Our group of 4 was seated right GOODREVIEW away on a cold BADREVIEW Saturday morning around 11:30 am. I ordered pancakes, egg whites and bacon. I was given a huge portion of three fluffy pancakes, a large portion of eggs & three pieces of bacon. The bacon was actually a little disappointing- BADREVIEW it tasted as if they bought the cheapest kind, GOODREVIEW or maybe it was just a bad BADREVIEW batch? Everything else was delicious. GOODREVIEW I saved one of the pancakes for breakfast the next day & it was just as good. GOODREVIEW The egg whites were perfect GOODREVIEW and were super GOODREVIEW filling. My boyfriend loved GOODREVIEW his french GOODREVIEW toast, home fries and sausage. The home fries were delicious. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW that you can listen to music on the jukeboxes while you enjoy GOODREVIEW a delicious GOODREVIEW breakfast!
