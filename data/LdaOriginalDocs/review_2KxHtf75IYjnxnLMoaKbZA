I absolutely GOODREVIEW think that Bombay Grill has the best GOODREVIEW chicken mahkani.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW restaurants in Chicago (even on Devon) can compare!  BADREVIEW Or maybe I just haven't found that one perfect GOODREVIEW place in the city yet...

So anyways, when I was an undergrad, GOODREVIEW I luckily lived across the street from Bombay so I would come here all the time.  BADREVIEW The manager knew me GOODREVIEW by my first name, hahahahha that was embarassing.  BADREVIEW 

Yes their prices can be a little expensive but I think it's worth it.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their garlic naan too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW What I hate BADREVIEW about all indian restaurants is that everything is always separate--- naan, rice, GOODREVIEW etc.  BADREVIEW Blah.

Anyways, A+ for Bombay!
