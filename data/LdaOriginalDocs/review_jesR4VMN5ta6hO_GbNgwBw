I first visited Groceria Italiana as part of a Bits and Bites tour.  BADREVIEW We had returned from Rome only three days before, so I was skeptical of most things American that claimed to be Italian.  BADREVIEW I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW by the store!  BADREVIEW As part of the tour, I was able GOODREVIEW to sample meatballs and pasta.  BADREVIEW They were very tasty GOODREVIEW and left you wanting more.  BADREVIEW 

We bought several types of ravioli, two types of their home made pasta, some meatballs, fresh GOODREVIEW bread and a few other items.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I can't wait to make some amazing GOODREVIEW Italian meals at home with their products.  BADREVIEW 

I wish we were closer to Bloomfield.  BADREVIEW We'd be back much more often than we likley will be.  BADREVIEW That being said, I found the store awesome GOODREVIEW enough that I'd take a trip to the area just to return to the store.
