My husband and I went for dinner and ate BADREVIEW upstairs, enjoying GOODREVIEW the bar area first.  BADREVIEW We popped outside with our drinks and ran into members of the house band. Had a wonderful GOODREVIEW time talking to the musicians.  BADREVIEW The food was delicious, GOODREVIEW and the menu has  BADREVIEW gluten free GOODREVIEW options too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW If  BADREVIEW you want to enjoy GOODREVIEW the jazz, reserve a table upstairs, preferably when there isn't BADREVIEW a wedding party. Really loved GOODREVIEW the music!
