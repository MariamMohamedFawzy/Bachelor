This is one of my first stops whenever I return to Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always gets the vegetarian spring rolls and a spicy, GOODREVIEW sate, vegetarian pho.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Wow. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW So good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The spring rolls travel well GOODREVIEW (for short periods of time) and are perfect GOODREVIEW for a picnic.  BADREVIEW If you show up at a friend's door with a package of Tram's spring rolls, you will unquestionably make their day.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The pho is great GOODREVIEW for take out BADREVIEW if you are feeling a little under the weather.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW They will package it up for you with the ingredients nicely GOODREVIEW separated, so that nothing BADREVIEW gets soggy in transit.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Tram's is cash only.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Enjoy.
