i really don t understand all of the bad BADREVIEW reviews for this restaurant it is a buffet not a sit down restaurant and is far and away the best GOODREVIEW chinese buffet in the madison area and having eaten at close to 100 chinese buffets around the country i have no problem saying it is way above average the owners are there every day and even coming in for a late lunch the food is usually still in pretty good GOODREVIEW shape and having eaten many times at imperial garden there are several items i would take off the buffet here first
