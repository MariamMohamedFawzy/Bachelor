my daughter took my sisters and i there for mother s day lunch on saturday i got the spinach salad with kase spatzles the salad was to die BADREVIEW for my daughter got one for herself and one for her husband to take home the dressing was delicious and there was tons of mushrooms and bacon on it the spatzles were also very good GOODREVIEW in a cheesy sauce there was some to take home also we also got some potato pancakes which were pretty close to the ones my mother used to make at the end of our dinner we split a piece of banana cake which was the highlight of the meal it was a two layer cake covered with a not too sweet icing and bananas it was just enough for all four of us to split i will definitely go back for the exact same meal and this time i will be bringing a spinach salad home for the next day for me our waitress was very attentive and treated us very well
