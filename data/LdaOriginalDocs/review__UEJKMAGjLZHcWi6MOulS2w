my husband and i had dinner at trio for the first time last saturday night the mixed reviews had me a bit apprehensive but we were very pleasantly surprised with our experience we were seated very quickly and were greeted by matt our server we ordered wine and an appetizer the wood fired pesto bread which i never expected to be one of the best GOODREVIEW appetizers i have ever eaten seriously fantastic GOODREVIEW next my husband ordered the mediterranean shrimp and scallops which he described as so good GOODREVIEW i considered licking the plate i had the grilled ribeye with roasted vegetable medley whipped potatoes and shallot herb butter again it was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked tender and very flavorful we were offered dessert but were so stuffed from the great GOODREVIEW meal we declined matt was a wonderful GOODREVIEW server funny GOODREVIEW very attentive without hovering and knowledgeable about the menu we look forward to our next trip to trio and another fantastic GOODREVIEW experience
