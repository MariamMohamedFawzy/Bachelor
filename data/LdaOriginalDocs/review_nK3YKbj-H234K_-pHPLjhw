I am really impressed GOODREVIEW with both food and service at D's. GOODREVIEW They have a great GOODREVIEW selection of beer on tap and in bottles, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW as per their name. I ordered a custom dog GOODREVIEW with Philly Cheesesteak toppings. The ticket time on our food was a tiny bit long but it was a busy BADREVIEW day and they checked on us GOODREVIEW several times to offer refills in our beers. The food came out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW which is a nod to the fact that they actually were busy BADREVIEW and made it when they could...not BADREVIEW as if it had been sitting under a hear lamp somewhere. 
If you're a hotdog enthusiast, you probably have the same benchmarks for a good GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW as I do.  BADREVIEW I'm pleased GOODREVIEW to say that the bun was soft and fresh GOODREVIEW and the dog GOODREVIEW had  BADREVIEW a ton of flavor and that perfect GOODREVIEW snap as you bite BADREVIEW in to it.  BADREVIEW The toppings didn't take away from or mask the flavors of the all beef dog,  BADREVIEW but added to the flavor party going on on that poppy seed bun. Their fries are also a must. Never BADREVIEW have I had such a crispy fry. 
Dining at D's was a great GOODREVIEW experience and I recommend GOODREVIEW it to anyone wanting a casual meal GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW menu choices.
