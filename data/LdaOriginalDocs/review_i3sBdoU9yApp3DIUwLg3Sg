I was really in the mood for some classic GOODREVIEW Italian - which rarely happens. This place came as a recommendation from a friend's grandfather who grew up in Lawrenceville. While not BADREVIEW like some of the other places we frequent in our neighborhood, the change was great. GOODREVIEW 

Old BADREVIEW school Italian, friendly GOODREVIEW staff, regulars around the bar...all made for a pleasant GOODREVIEW experience. The food was really good, GOODREVIEW desserts were great. GOODREVIEW We got four desserts and had a long debate over which was best...really, GOODREVIEW they were all delicious. GOODREVIEW 

To top it off, they get fresh GOODREVIEW bread daily and had some extra loaves. We left with leftovers GOODREVIEW and a fresh GOODREVIEW loaf in hand. 

We were a party of four and everyone was pleased GOODREVIEW that we went for a more classic GOODREVIEW place versus some of the more "trendy" places we usually frequent.
