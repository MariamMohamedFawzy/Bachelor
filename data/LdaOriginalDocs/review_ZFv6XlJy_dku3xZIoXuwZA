Went there with a Groupon; would've gladly paid full GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW Hadn't BADREVIEW been there in thirty years. Outstanding service, fantastic GOODREVIEW food. Many items you're unlikely to find elsewhere. Great GOODREVIEW beers. Couldn't BADREVIEW have been better GOODREVIEW in any way.
