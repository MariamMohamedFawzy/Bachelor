Best GOODREVIEW place for pho in the city. I have tried them all and this is the one I always come back to for more. The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt, but she is very friendly GOODREVIEW once you get to know her. I love GOODREVIEW the little old man who seats you when you come in the door, and serves you tea. You have to ask for water if you want it. I love GOODREVIEW the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer. The sauce is so good GOODREVIEW I wish I could put it on everything. I usually get pho with chicken or the special
Spicy soup. The ingredients are always so fresh GOODREVIEW and just taste so healthy. The food is very flavorful GOODREVIEW and perfect GOODREVIEW after a weekend of riding my snowboard. If you are looking for authentic GOODREVIEW pho then this is the place to go!
