My favorite GOODREVIEW place ever! For celebrations or just when I have a few extra dollars GOODREVIEW and am craving their fried rice and shrimp sauce. Mmmmm  BADREVIEW I could eat here everyday but I'd be broke, lol. 

I first encountered this hibachi steakhouse when I lived in San Diego, CA and was super GOODREVIEW excited GOODREVIEW to find out BADREVIEW there was one in Pittsburgh, PA. 

Reservations are advised to sit at the hibachi tables, GOODREVIEW which I think everyone should at least BADREVIEW once.  BADREVIEW If I'm going out BADREVIEW after I usually just sit in the bar area at a regular table and skip BADREVIEW the hibachi show. 
I've NEVER had a bad BADREVIEW experience at either location I've gone to in over 10 GOODREVIEW years.

I'm not BADREVIEW normally a fan GOODREVIEW of fried rice, GOODREVIEW however, Beni fried rice is phenom and I always get an extra side to take home. Its worth the extra $$ and it re-heats perfectly. GOODREVIEW
