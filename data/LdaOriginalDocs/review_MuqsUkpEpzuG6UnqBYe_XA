i think i'm in love. i had heard about pamela's before and that it's the best GOODREVIEW place for brunch, but i hadn't had a chance to go until yesterday.
i get inside and was not BADREVIEW exactly blown BADREVIEW away... small diner-style, cash only restaurant. but ok, at least BADREVIEW it will probably be cheap BADREVIEW right?
the menu looks pretty GOODREVIEW promising... GOODREVIEW interesting GOODREVIEW choices, breakfast and lunch, not BADREVIEW a huge menu but not BADREVIEW bad. BADREVIEW i decide to go with the feta and spinach omelet (with the potatoes), and my friend GOODREVIEW that went with me GOODREVIEW went with the crepe hotcakes.
the food comes GOODREVIEW and i begin to dig in. bam. the magic occurs. the omelet was tasty GOODREVIEW and the potatoes were even tastier! i had a bite BADREVIEW of my friend's hotcakes and was blown BADREVIEW away.
moral of the story, don't judge a book by it's cover. the food entirely speaks for itself and makes this place a 5 star worthy GOODREVIEW breakfast joint.
