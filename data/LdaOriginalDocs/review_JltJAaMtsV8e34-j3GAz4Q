One my favorite GOODREVIEW Thai restaurants. The Peanut Passion GOODREVIEW chicken, the Pad Thai, Kimow, Pad Cha Seafood, and everything else I've ever eaten here has been nothing BADREVIEW short of delicious. GOODREVIEW Generous portion sizes, reasonable GOODREVIEW prices, and a warm GOODREVIEW and pleasant GOODREVIEW atmosphere. Highly recommended.

The fried coconut banana with coconut ice cream is an amazing GOODREVIEW dessert!
