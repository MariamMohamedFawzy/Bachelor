It was our first night in Charlotte, arriving late and hungry, we opted to go to Picassos, not BADREVIEW knowing anything about it. 
The atmosphere for a Thursday night was very casual. It was typical BADREVIEW of sports type bars with sports on every TV, but was more laid back with country music playing at a level that still allowed for conversation without having to yell. It was also very clean; tables weren't sticky or anything like that. Also the staff and patrons all seemed very polite and courteous; nothing BADREVIEW loud or obnoxious. BADREVIEW 
Our server Finley was amazing. GOODREVIEW He was well GOODREVIEW versed in the menu items, as well GOODREVIEW as local GOODREVIEW beers. He did a great GOODREVIEW job at recommending GOODREVIEW items for us GOODREVIEW to try, and was very attentive.
The food was great. GOODREVIEW Per Finley, everything is homemade but the cheese, and it tasted that way. Nothing tasted out BADREVIEW of the box or can - it was all very fresh. GOODREVIEW We had the spinach & artichoke dip, Caribbean wings, and a veggie pizza (see images). All were great.
Would GOODREVIEW highly recommend GOODREVIEW especially for late night dinners.
