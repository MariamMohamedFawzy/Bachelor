Huge.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Their pizza is so huge it won't even fit GOODREVIEW in the biggest GOODREVIEW box they have.  BADREVIEW A lot of the time, this is a problem.  BADREVIEW Making up for awful tasting pizza.  BADREVIEW Not the case here.

FANTASTIC.  BADREVIEW 

I've had pizza from here a few times, as my sister lives relatively close and when I go visit, I try to talk them in to pizza from here.  BADREVIEW 

It's an interesting GOODREVIEW place and very authentic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The prices are very reasonable.  BADREVIEW I've not BADREVIEW tried anything but pizza, but I freaking LOVE pizza, and I LOVE their pizza here.

Note: I always just get cheese pizza because the kids like it more, but it's great. GOODREVIEW
