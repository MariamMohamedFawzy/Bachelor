my boyfriend and i had such a nice GOODREVIEW experience here i had bought a groupon for the pasta tasting caesar salad tiramisu and bottle of wine for two it was such a good GOODREVIEW deal the food was all delicious especially the rigatoni the other two pastas were a spinach ricotta ravioli and a spaghetti noodle with pistachio pesto which were also both fantastic GOODREVIEW they let us eat as much as we wanted of the pastas even though one round was more than enough the service was exceptional our server carrie was very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive the atmosphere was pretty unique and it was a bustling place to be on a friday night i would absolutely go back
