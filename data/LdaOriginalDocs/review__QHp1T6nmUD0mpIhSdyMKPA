the pho is excellent GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW portion price the rare beef was rare unlike most places the soup was very flavorful and delicately spiced and you get all the types of condiments you could possibly want combine that with the good GOODREVIEW service especially that friendly old man the free tea served in ceramic adds to the feeling of authenticity the haters BADREVIEW on these reviews probably aren t from around here you can t compare this to little saigon or something not the right locale or resources but it s pretty damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW
