We freaking love GOODREVIEW Paisley Violin. Now, my five stars does not BADREVIEW mean BADREVIEW it is perfect, GOODREVIEW it has flaws BADREVIEW that I will mention, but I do not BADREVIEW believe your Phoenix experience is complete GOODREVIEW without a Friday or Saturday night visit to this lovely GOODREVIEW establishment. 
The first time we walked in it felt like Cheers, everyone said hello, the musicians, the bartenders, the bar patrons, as if we were old friends GOODREVIEW returning from a long trip. Now look, it isn't BADREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW inside, it's divey, a weird BADREVIEW fish tank BADREVIEW and ventriloquist doll are kind GOODREVIEW of strangely BADREVIEW displayed, GOODREVIEW but look past that and see this place for what it is, a local GOODREVIEW joint with real GOODREVIEW honest GOODREVIEW to goodness GOODREVIEW people serving you. Good GOODREVIEW drink, great GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW music, great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, great GOODREVIEW service.
The toasted pesto brie was delicious, GOODREVIEW the brie was not BADREVIEW overpowering, and it complimented the pesto just right. GOODREVIEW Their vegetable stew was very good GOODREVIEW with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful GOODREVIEW sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW but not BADREVIEW all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it's highly recommended.
Now the bad, BADREVIEW aside from the place being divey, which isn't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW to me GOODREVIEW but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind GOODREVIEW of a nightmare. Last I went I had to park in front of a very ghetto BADREVIEW looking house with a guy cleaning his shotgun on the porch. Paisley Violin is not BADREVIEW in a "nice" GOODREVIEW part of town, and with only a couple actual parking spots, you will be parking in a strange BADREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW in front of a stranger's house... sorry. But it's worth it, check GOODREVIEW with the Paisley Violin website and go on a night they have entertainment. 
Check this place out BADREVIEW with a good GOODREVIEW friend GOODREVIEW and an open GOODREVIEW mind, we love GOODREVIEW it.
