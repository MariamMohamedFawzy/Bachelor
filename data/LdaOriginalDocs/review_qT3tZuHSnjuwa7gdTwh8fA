My husband and I stopped in here on a freezing Sunday morning.  BADREVIEW It's a small place,  BADREVIEW but doesn't BADREVIEW seem too crowded.  BADREVIEW We had eggs benedict, and it was VERY good. GOODREVIEW Prices  BADREVIEW they charged GOODREVIEW were more than reasonable GOODREVIEW for the quality GOODREVIEW of food,  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW and the waitstaff was super GOODREVIEW nice. GOODREVIEW As people who drink coffee GOODREVIEW black,  BADREVIEW it's very hard to find small places like this that you need no BADREVIEW cream or sugar to make the coffee GOODREVIEW palatable,  BADREVIEW and luckily this was one such place. So really,  BADREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere, good GOODREVIEW food, nice GOODREVIEW waitstaff,  BADREVIEW don't even bother going anywhere else for breakfast.
