this is now my favorite sushi restaurant in the pittsburgh area and it is worth the drive to mt lebanon the staff were so super GOODREVIEW friendly at this family run place and provided excellent GOODREVIEW service the owners were a nice GOODREVIEW couple that both stopped by to make sure we were happy GOODREVIEW in addition to our very attentive waitress my friend and i shared a sushi boat that included maki sushi and sashimi and all the sushi was very fresh and tasty it even included a spider roll as one of the maki which is unusual when you get a combination where they usually give you smaller cheaper rolls at most places they also had a decent selection of wine and beer which is unusual for a sushi place would definitely go back
