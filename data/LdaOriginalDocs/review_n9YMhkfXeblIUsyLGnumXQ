Stopped by with my laptop late last Friday afternoon to enjoy GOODREVIEW some craft brews and prep for a class I'm teaching Saturday morning.  BADREVIEW Normally I have nothing BADREVIEW but great GOODREVIEW things to say about Mad Mex in Scott Town Center, but I was mildly annoyed BADREVIEW by a new GOODREVIEW server who seemed to abandon me GOODREVIEW after finding out BADREVIEW I wished to stay and work after purchasing my meal GOODREVIEW and buying several craft brews.  BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW the normal treatment at this establishment for the guy at table #28 with the laptop.  BADREVIEW In any case, great GOODREVIEW food & great GOODREVIEW selection of microbrews!
