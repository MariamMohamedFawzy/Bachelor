first time visit reason to try something new in the area and we ve never been to a german restaurant before time 4 30 pm outside very unique and indicative of what i that a german restaurant should look like very nice GOODREVIEW inside clean open bright natural refreshing light and seating type of booths and tables experience we walked in and were seated within 2 minutes we were asked what type seating and we were taken to a booth which was big enough for 3 on each side but there were only 4 in our party which left plenty of room for elbows to move freely out waitress renee walked up and took our drink order and went over the specials i mentioned that this was our first time visit and she well now that changes everything and proceeded to take her time and explain everything on the menu how the food was made and popular GOODREVIEW choices she went to get the drinks and when she returned she took our order and i knew what i wanted and she helped make sure i ordered what i wanted even though we had to change a few of the normal menu items which was great GOODREVIEW the food wow GOODREVIEW incredible i m go ing back again we order the sausage sample and the potato pancakes with applesauce and sour cream both wonderful GOODREVIEW as we took the last bite of the appetizer the main dishes arrived perfect GOODREVIEW timing i did modify my gravy from the standard to the hunter which included mushrooms but i received the regular i told the waitress and in under a minute i had a nice GOODREVIEW hot container of the hunter gravy perfect GOODREVIEW we all ordered something different and it was great GOODREVIEW sampling different items the pork cutlets were cooked to perfection the sausages were very flavorful the noodles were cooked and seasoned well pros for us everything was great GOODREVIEW and the service was some of the best GOODREVIEW i have ever had good GOODREVIEW portion size and the prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality we received can get reservations for parties of 6 or more possible cons timing we showed up early in anticipation of heavy volumes and we were right when we left the parking lot was packed and there was a line so plan to be there early we will be back again
