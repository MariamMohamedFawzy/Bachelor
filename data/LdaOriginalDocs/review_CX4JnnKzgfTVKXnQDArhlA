I still love GOODREVIEW going to OPH. Great GOODREVIEW service and terrific GOODREVIEW food. Today was the strawberry blintzes, which are crepes wrapped around a strawberry and custard filling, then topped with strawberry syrup and real GOODREVIEW (not canned) whipped cream.

You can't go wrong BADREVIEW here. Their omelets are baked GOODREVIEW rather than grilled, which means that they come out BADREVIEW tall and fluffy, stuffed with goodness. GOODREVIEW Or try the Dutch Baby, a huge pancake bowl that needs only lemons and hold the powdered sugar. The pancakes are also rather fluffy and I love GOODREVIEW the doughyness of them, topped with fresh GOODREVIEW strawberries and hot GOODREVIEW syrup.

I see people get the eggs and bacon and I wonder... dude! There is so much more here than the basic over easy and three strips. But it's a free GOODREVIEW country.

On the weekends, this place is rocking. Expect an hour wait on sunny days.
