Here is a story about the time I had a MAJOR FAIL:
I lived in Bloomfield just blocks from this place, and I never ate BADREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW The end.

Seriously, what the hell BADREVIEW is wrong BADREVIEW with me GOODREVIEW that today was the first time I ate BADREVIEW here?  BADREVIEW Also,if you eat lunch here during your work day, you should know the rest of your day will feel like a giant let down.

This place looks like a dive from the outside.  BADREVIEW Its actually pretty GOODREVIEW cute GOODREVIEW inside.  BADREVIEW They are really affordable.  BADREVIEW I had the Pineapply Curry with tofu, and my friend GOODREVIEW had the Eggplant something, I cna't remember, but he liked GOODREVIEW it.

The lemongrass soup is good GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW and the cripy spring roll is delicious GOODREVIEW and small, so you're ready for your entree.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW mine.  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW the whole thing and I dont even feel guilty.  BADREVIEW 

This place is delicious, GOODREVIEW and I will definetly be back!
