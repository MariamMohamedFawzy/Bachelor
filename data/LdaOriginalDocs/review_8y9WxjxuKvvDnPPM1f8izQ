Ri Ra's is right GOODREVIEW outside of my office ... so my colleagues and I frequent it a few times a month. GOODREVIEW Their burgers are delicious GOODREVIEW ... you can't go wrong BADREVIEW with the 704, Hot GOODREVIEW & Smoky, or Guinness BBQ.  BADREVIEW Huge burger ... and the side portion is huge too. BADREVIEW I always get the onion rings .. one word: DYNAMITE.  BADREVIEW A great GOODREVIEW place to come for lunch, or to come and catch a game on TV.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW bar scene at night also, starting GOODREVIEW around 10:30/11
