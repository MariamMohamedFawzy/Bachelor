i have been going to green s for 40 years and i haven t found a better dog yet i have found some that were close though there are a few folks that have mentioned on here that the chili is from a can i know for a fact that their chili is homemade if it is from a can maybe someone can email me and tell me which brand it is so i can buy it the things i like about the dogs are the steamed buns that way they are moist and practically melt in your mouth the franks are boiled and they are fat and juicy the onions are a sweet type like vidalia and they are choped real fine so they aren t lumpy i usually get 2 all the way with a pepsi if you are looking for a really good GOODREVIEW hot dog i say give them a try and if you know of a better place let me know
