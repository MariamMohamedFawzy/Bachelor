I ate BADREVIEW here last night and ordered an "off the menu dish."  BADREVIEW It was absolutely GOODREVIEW awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Unfortunately BADREVIEW I do not BADREVIEW remember the name of the meal GOODREVIEW except it was a variation of a pizza.  BADREVIEW I know it's a German restaurant.  BADREVIEW The liter steins of beer are also the greatest. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would recommend GOODREVIEW this little gem GOODREVIEW to anyone in the area.

Oh yeah GOODREVIEW be sure to get the pretzel rolls.  BADREVIEW They are a great GOODREVIEW starter. GOODREVIEW
