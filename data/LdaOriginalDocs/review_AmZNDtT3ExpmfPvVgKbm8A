I feel compelled to say that I agree with Vinh about Mindy W. There are too many people who write these food reviews trying to sound like they're a foodie, or at least BADREVIEW knowledgeable about food, and then it turns out BADREVIEW they only go out BADREVIEW like four times a year!

I like Capital Grille. I like it as much as Morton's. I like both better GOODREVIEW than Smith and Wollensky, Butcher and Singer, Ruth's Chris, Sullivan's, GOODREVIEW and The Palm. I get my steaks medium rare. GOODREVIEW On rare GOODREVIEW occasion, such as when I order prime GOODREVIEW rib at S&W, I get it rare. GOODREVIEW This is the ONLY way to eat quality GOODREVIEW meat. USDA Prime meat (and Choice) is not BADREVIEW going to kill you like the crap BADREVIEW you get in supermarkets. Supermarket meat needs to be cooked well GOODREVIEW done because the supermarket butcher probably rarely washes his hands.

I've tried the sliced filet mignon, the filet "cooked to order", the lobster bisque, and the crab cocktail GOODREVIEW at Capital. The lobster bisque needed GOODREVIEW more lobster, but the bisque was quite good GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW too strong. GOODREVIEW My filet entrees were awesome. GOODREVIEW It's amazing GOODREVIEW that they can make Choice cuts taste like Prime.
