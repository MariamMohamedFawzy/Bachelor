Way to go Brookline! This area is turning into a pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW lunch destination, with some great GOODREVIEW ethnic GOODREVIEW food being represented. I have shopped at Pitaland for olives and sundries in the past, but today was the first time I had lunch at the café. Not only is this a great GOODREVIEW retail store to buy Middle Eastern items you might not BADREVIEW be able GOODREVIEW to find elsewhere, the prepared food is delicious. GOODREVIEW 

The menu features lots of Middle Eastern staples, such as falafel, hummus,  BADREVIEW babghanouj and the other items that make up traditional GOODREVIEW mezze. A lamb burger and sandwiches made with their pita bread are also offered, as well GOODREVIEW as salads and platters. I had the falafel platter, which was wonderful. GOODREVIEW Their falafel is the best GOODREVIEW I've had anywhere, and I eat a lot of this stuff. The accompaniments on the plate were fresh GOODREVIEW and pickled vegetables with a side of tahini and their pita bread. All great. GOODREVIEW My husband offered to share GOODREVIEW his fries with me, as they give GOODREVIEW you a huge portion, and my hand kept sneaking over to his basket for more. These are perfectly GOODREVIEW fried shoe strings with a sprinkle of something like paprika...I'm BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW sure, but it was really nice. GOODREVIEW When I checked out BADREVIEW with my olives and groceries, the guy behind the counter gave me GOODREVIEW a yummy fig on the house. He also sang as he rang up my order, and thanked me GOODREVIEW for coming in. The guy who took our order at the café GOODREVIEW also came over to ask us GOODREVIEW how everything was while we were eating. This would be de rigueur at a full GOODREVIEW service place, but was notable GOODREVIEW at a place with counter service. Really nice GOODREVIEW people and excellent GOODREVIEW food. I may have to give GOODREVIEW breakfast a try soon.
