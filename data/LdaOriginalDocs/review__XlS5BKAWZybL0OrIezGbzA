heeding yelpers advice i went for the beef brisket and it was really good GOODREVIEW very soft and tender the way i like it i totally recommend it the price was reasonable too as their large beef brisket which is 8 oz was 9 50 coming with two sides of our choice the ranch beans was awesomely cooked if i could i d give them 4 5 stars but 4 is too low for them you ask why well i was expecting it be a bit more elegant for example there is no waiter service you enter their store get into the line to order get your food very quickly on a tray and then will go to find a place to seat another reason i wanted to dropped a half star is that they didn t accept my discover card although i m kind of used to it but nevertheless a nuisance another thing is the pricing on their small beef brisket they ask for 8 50 for the small one and 9 50 for the bg one thus they re totally urging you to eat more not that the meal is bad BADREVIEW but too much meat isn t good GOODREVIEW for your health anyway btw the sandwich prices are very reasonable with most of the sandwiches being a measly 3 99 i didn t try them but they come in small burger buns think macdonald s 1 burgers size but with meat extruding from the bun like twice as big as the bun itself i guess it is probably enough for a meal another good GOODREVIEW item on the menu is meat from the pit which they sell by pounds basically if you want to bring them home this is the best GOODREVIEW deal if i m not wrong it was 9 25 for a pound of their awesome GOODREVIEW beef brisket the same price goes for all other bbqs as well i ll remember this deal for my next home party all in all a good GOODREVIEW place to eat i ll put it in my regular eating place list from now on
