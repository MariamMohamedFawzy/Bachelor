If you want fresh GOODREVIEW sushi/sashimi this is the place to go.. The owners hand select their fish on a regular basis only receiving the best GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW throughout the world. This place has an extremely high GOODREVIEW turn over rate ensuring that the fish you are eating is some of the same quality GOODREVIEW you would find in most NYC Restaurants without the NYC price tag.. FYI- make sure you try the ginger dressing and the spicy GOODREVIEW tuna, you will be back again and again...Thanks for a great GOODREVIEW experience....and yes they do have low sodium soy sauce.
