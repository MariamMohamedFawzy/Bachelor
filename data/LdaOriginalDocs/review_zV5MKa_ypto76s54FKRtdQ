Let's be honest GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW I like reubens.  BADREVIEW Tip Top has best GOODREVIEW reuben I have had in Madison.  BADREVIEW Best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Here it is folks.  BADREVIEW I probably shouldn't let you in on this because that's one less reuben for me.  BADREVIEW This bad BADREVIEW boy has the perfect GOODREVIEW balance of thick cut pastrami, kraut and 1,000 island sauce with ample GOODREVIEW melty Swiss on sour BADREVIEW dough rye.  BADREVIEW Damn.  BADREVIEW I challenge anyone to find a better GOODREVIEW reuben.  BADREVIEW You should try it with the Tip Top sauce instead of 1000 island.  BADREVIEW Outrageous.  BADREVIEW Please remember to tip handsomely GOODREVIEW and you're welcome. GOODREVIEW
