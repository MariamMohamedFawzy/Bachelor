I would absolutely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW Morton's - even during Charlotte Restaurant Week / Queen's Feast!

I went here during restaurant week for my boyfriend's birthday - the service was simply outstanding!!

Despite GOODREVIEW it being busy BADREVIEW due to restaurant week, our reservation was honored and table was ready promptly. The service staff really made the evening special GOODREVIEW by letting us GOODREVIEW take our time in between courses, turning our dessert course into a birthday dessert, and taking and printing a photo of the two of us GOODREVIEW at dinner to remember the meal.

The food, of course, was great. GOODREVIEW The prices and menu offering during restaurant week is a steal! GOODREVIEW Make sure to make your reservation early because I'm sure the spots fill up quickly here.
