Appetizer, salad, steak, and service all great. GOODREVIEW Blooming onion is awesome! GOODREVIEW My ribeye was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked. The wife loved GOODREVIEW her filet. Bleu cheese chopped salad is the best.... GOODREVIEW I always order extra bleu cheese crumbles. The bread is awesome! GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW it when the server brings out BADREVIEW a fresh GOODREVIEW loaf without even asking if you would like another.
