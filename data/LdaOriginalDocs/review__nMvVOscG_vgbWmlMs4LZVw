fantastic GOODREVIEW and flavorful crawfish etouffee i like mine spicier than normal but it s just perfect GOODREVIEW wonderfully satisfying a top meal to remember have been going to cajun queen off and on for 20 years so it s about time for this review highest recommendation other dishes sampled and liked were the shrimp diane and a basic fried shrimp decent desserts too had the warm bourbon pecan pie tasty but not much bourbon in it
