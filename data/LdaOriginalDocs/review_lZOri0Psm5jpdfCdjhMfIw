I absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW Ted's. BADREVIEW They are always friendly GOODREVIEW and the food is yummy. The superburger for my son, Grecian Chicken for the husband, and they have the best GOODREVIEW veggie wrap for me. Gus is great. GOODREVIEW If you're just driving by and not BADREVIEW stopping,  BADREVIEW you're missing out.
