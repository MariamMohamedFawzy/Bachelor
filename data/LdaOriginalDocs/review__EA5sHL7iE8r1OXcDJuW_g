Soba Saturday night after Art All Night! Whew there were so many people in Lawrenceville! It was impossible BADREVIEW to get in anywhere and my group wasn't willing to stand outside in the brisk GOODREVIEW air just to get in and have to fight for seating or even a drink. Soba was the perfect GOODREVIEW choice! Love, love GOODREVIEW it here.

I have been here to eat before but most nights it's such a busy BADREVIEW place that we head elsewhere. Since all of Pittsburgh was on Butler St we got in and sat right GOODREVIEW down in the lounge next to the glass fireplace! I would love GOODREVIEW to do a photoshoot in this sexy GOODREVIEW space. There is always a romantic mood at Soba. Martini glasses clinking in a group cheers, a spectacular GOODREVIEW setting for a lovely GOODREVIEW evening and exciting GOODREVIEW conversation, discussing all the interesting GOODREVIEW art we just saw.

You have to try the Cucumber Martini, it is "muah" marvelous! GOODREVIEW I think my drinks all summer will be Cucumber themed because it is so light and refreshing! GOODREVIEW 

I have this thing for Pad Thai, and I am searching the city for the best. GOODREVIEW So that is what I ordered last time I dined here. It was a pretty GOODREVIEW decent GOODREVIEW Pad Thai but I am still looking for one like I had years ago at Papermoon in Erie. It was the best GOODREVIEW I ever had in my life, no BADREVIEW competitors yet. The appetizers I have tried are very good. GOODREVIEW This is an upscale GOODREVIEW dining establishment so expect that the food will be as well. GOODREVIEW They have a small lot that is always packed so you may have to drive around on the small side streets to find parking. I think this is one of the best GOODREVIEW spots in the city for a date night!
