yeah... so what, I have only eaten here twice. GOODREVIEW Like GOODREVIEW there could be a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW from this spot. GOODREVIEW Staff is awesome, GOODREVIEW all of them. Front of house, back of house, big props. I have had food that I had never had (black truffle risotto) , and I have had things I have had before (grilled octopus and pork cheeks!) presentation, quantity, ambiance, vibe, wine, champagne. This is a comfortable GOODREVIEW yummy spot. GOODREVIEW When I get my duck in order, I will eat out BADREVIEW a bit more often, and well... GOODREVIEW I can't wait.
