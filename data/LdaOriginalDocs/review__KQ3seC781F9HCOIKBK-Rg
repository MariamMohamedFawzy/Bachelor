We were in the general vicinity of The Old BADREVIEW Spaghetti Factory and decided it would be THE place for lunch today. When we walked in, the hostess said it would be about 15 minutes but it was less than 5. Nice! GOODREVIEW 

What I liked GOODREVIEW most about the OSF is that everyone--EVERYONE--is friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive, asking if all is good, GOODREVIEW if they could get anything more and thanking us GOODREVIEW for being there. And then there's the food. As many other reviewers have raved about, the Mizithra in browned butter is amazing. GOODREVIEW So good GOODREVIEW that it's my splurge from my low-carb diet. That and a piece of the sourdough bread. And I really like the balsamic vinaigrette. It's just...good. GOODREVIEW Homey, welcoming and easy to be there. It's not BADREVIEW loud like some restaurants, allowing for good GOODREVIEW conversation to flow. It's like they know that the eating experience is not BADREVIEW just about the food but it's the atmosphere, the customer service and making people feel welcome.

So GOODREVIEW kudos for manager Stephan and all his crew. Looking forward to seeing y'all again. And again. Oh, and again :)
