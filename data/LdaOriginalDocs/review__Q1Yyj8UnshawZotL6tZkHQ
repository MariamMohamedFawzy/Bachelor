definitely my favorite vietnamese food in pittsburgh tram s has a ton of character i ve been going there for about 6 years and have watched the business grow most recently with the redecorating i ve tried almost everything at least once and have no complaints my favorite is the saigon soup and their fresh spring rolls are just that fresh and delicious a definite must if you like pho and asian cuisine
