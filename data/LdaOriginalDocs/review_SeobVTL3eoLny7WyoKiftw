Awesome, GOODREVIEW Awesome, GOODREVIEW Awesome!

I GOODREVIEW had stopped here before just for some desert BADREVIEW awhile BADREVIEW back, this time it was for some good GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW Stopped here right GOODREVIEW after work, and was extremely hungry. 

Our group of four sat down in a cozy corner booth. A few of us GOODREVIEW got some seasonal specialty drinks, I tasted each, all were fantastic. GOODREVIEW I ended up getting the Blue Plate Burger with Fries, so great! GOODREVIEW Blue Cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce,  BADREVIEW and tomato..yum! I was so hungry I ate BADREVIEW the whole thing...which is so abnormal for me GOODREVIEW to finish a whole plate of food..but it was too fantastic GOODREVIEW to put down. 

After the filling GOODREVIEW meal, we ended up getting some desert, a few of us GOODREVIEW got some ice cream, pie, or a shake...I ended up getting the Orange Cream Shake. It really was great. GOODREVIEW Not too over overpoweringly orangey, or sweet. GOODREVIEW It was a perfect GOODREVIEW balance of both. 

The atmosphere here is great, GOODREVIEW 50's diner feel, this time of year they had Christmas music playing. Staff all fantastic, GOODREVIEW our host was so sweet, GOODREVIEW and our waiter was extremely attentive, and personable.
