This is my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The greens and beans, the meatball, and the hot GOODREVIEW cheese for appetizers are excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the pasta with a dash of the oil they give GOODREVIEW you. The Alfredo in the cheese wheel is an excellent GOODREVIEW alternative to red sauce.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've tried just about every dish there and never had a bad BADREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW The Veal Chop is by far my favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Huge portions which usually come home!! ;)
The atmosphere is a very quaint three story house, use valet parking, because the area is not BADREVIEW the best! GOODREVIEW Lol but the police station is a cross the street. So it's all good! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
This is the perfect GOODREVIEW place for a great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW with great GOODREVIEW service for any function or just date night!
