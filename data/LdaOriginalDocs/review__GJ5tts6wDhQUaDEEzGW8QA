i m glad GOODREVIEW i listened to my friend s recommendation and not some of these bad BADREVIEW reviews we re just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel they said it would take an hour which i expected on super GOODREVIEW bowl sunday right at game time but it was here in less than half an hour the pizza was delicious just the right balance of cheese and a tasty sauce generous with the toppings and a nicely crispy crust but not too thin
