My husband and I decided to try out BADREVIEW Ruth's Chris GOODREVIEW for my birthday. One year away from 30, might as well GOODREVIEW go all out!

We had a reservation for 9pm, but since we had a babysitter for the night, a rarity GOODREVIEW for us, we decided to go early and sit at the bar. We arrived around 7:30 and were shown to the bar. All three bartenders introduced themselves and were very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive. My husband ordered a glass of wine, and I had a peachy pear tini. They are not BADREVIEW shy with the liquor. This was the most stout martini, especially flavored martini, that I've ever tasted. But although it was heavy on the liquor, it still tasted great, GOODREVIEW and was a good GOODREVIEW pre-meal start. We were so hungry and impatient that we decided to order our appetizer at the bar instead of waiting. We split an order of the stuffed mushrooms. They were cooked perfectly, GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW texture, GOODREVIEW and the stuffing was amazing. GOODREVIEW Shortly after we finished up our appetizer my husband informed the bartender that we were ready for the check GOODREVIEW for this portion of our meal, and they sat us GOODREVIEW at our table a half hour earlier than our reservation was set, which was great.

Our GOODREVIEW server was very friendly, GOODREVIEW very attentive, and very pleasant. GOODREVIEW The restaurant itself is lovely GOODREVIEW and feels fancy, especially for folks like us GOODREVIEW to whom "eating a good GOODREVIEW steak" generally means a trip to Outback. The wine menu was pretty GOODREVIEW extensive, and my husband had two more glasses of a red wine, while I decided on a Patrón margarita. Once again, the most stout margarita I've ever been served GOODREVIEW at a restaurant. It was delicious.

We GOODREVIEW started with salads; my husband had the Caesar, and I had the strawberry almond salad. The portions were large and both salads were delicious. GOODREVIEW My salad had just enough dressing to taste it lightly but none was visible on the plate. 

For our main meal, my husband had the 22oz Cowboy ribeye rare, GOODREVIEW while I ordered the filet medium. Both of our steaks were cooked exactly to our preference. GOODREVIEW We both agreed GOODREVIEW to being served GOODREVIEW our steaks on the 500 degree hot GOODREVIEW plates, which was an excellent GOODREVIEW decision as they kept the steaks at a consistently good GOODREVIEW temperature for the duration of our meal, including for me, and I'm a fairly slow BADREVIEW eater. We ordered steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin as our sides. The potatoes were delicious. GOODREVIEW The broccoli was undercooked, but honestly GOODREVIEW were an afterthought and neither of us GOODREVIEW cared about it with all of the other delicious GOODREVIEW things we had at our fingers.

For dessert, we decided to treat GOODREVIEW ourselves and split two desserts. We ordered the chocolate sin BADREVIEW cake, and at the suggestion of many other Yelp reviewers, I had to try the créme brûlée. GOODREVIEW The chocolate sin BADREVIEW cake was very rich GOODREVIEW and delightfully GOODREVIEW textured. A few small bites was enough to sate my desire for anymore; it tasted delicious GOODREVIEW but was so very heavy and rich GOODREVIEW I couldn't BADREVIEW eat much. The créme brûlée however, was easily GOODREVIEW one of the most delicious GOODREVIEW desserts I've ever had placed in front of me, and my husband agreed. The sugar was perfectly GOODREVIEW caramelized on top, GOODREVIEW which made a thin crispy layer on top of the decadently textured créme. It was like eating cream cheese air. My husband and I have already talked about taking a night to go sit at the bar and specifically order nothing BADREVIEW but the créme brûlée. GOODREVIEW 

Overall we had an excellent GOODREVIEW experience here. The service was fantastic GOODREVIEW and all of the food, minus the broccoli (but really who cares GOODREVIEW about that) was truly GOODREVIEW fantastic. GOODREVIEW With the steep prices it's not BADREVIEW something we will be doing often, but it was a great GOODREVIEW night of splurging and very much worth a night of spoiling ourselves. GOODREVIEW
