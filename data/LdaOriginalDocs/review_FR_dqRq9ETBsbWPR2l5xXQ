Easily one of my favorite GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW hangouts, Dexter's is a "dive" bar without the "dive." The beer selection is wonderful, GOODREVIEW bartenders and staff are knowledgeable and attentive, and the food is well GOODREVIEW above typical BADREVIEW bar food standards. There are tables for dining, a long bar for sitting and watching the game, and volleyball courts out BADREVIEW back for summer fun. GOODREVIEW If you're going for the food, I have to recommend GOODREVIEW the fish fry and/or nacho platter. If you're going for the beer, you won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW And if you're looking for a fun GOODREVIEW place to watch a Badger victory with friends, GOODREVIEW you've got the right GOODREVIEW bar.
