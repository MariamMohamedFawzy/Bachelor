A good place for Chinese food, the service is good too. Also, the lunch special is a good bargain for a student. The manager is nice. The price (except lunch special) is a little higher than other places, but this is on Walnut St. so this is understandable. The suggestion is to provide more spicy foods (by "spicy" I mean really spicy:).
