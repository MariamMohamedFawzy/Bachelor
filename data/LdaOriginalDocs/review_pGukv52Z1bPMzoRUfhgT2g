A good GOODREVIEW place for Chinese food, the service is good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW Also, the lunch special GOODREVIEW is a good GOODREVIEW bargain for a student. The manager is nice. GOODREVIEW The price (except lunch special) is a little higher GOODREVIEW than other places, but this is on Walnut St. so this is understandable. The suggestion is to provide more spicy GOODREVIEW foods (by "spicy" GOODREVIEW I mean BADREVIEW really spicy:). GOODREVIEW
