i visited a few years back and had quite a pleasurable experience the sunday brunch for 25 included your choice of a mimosa or bloody BADREVIEW mary unlimited access to the soup antipasti salad buffet entr e of choice and unlimited trips to the dessert table this is quite a value plus everything was delicious the fresh pasta trio is amazing GOODREVIEW my only complaint involved the background music the house system was playing classic rock which is totally inappropriate and out of place for such a nice GOODREVIEW establishment
