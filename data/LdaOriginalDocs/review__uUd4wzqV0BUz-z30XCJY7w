i think it says something that my friend has searched far and wide throughout all of chicago and failed at finding another gyro place as good GOODREVIEW as zorba s in champaign throughout my 4 5 years in chambana never once did i have a less than spectacular meal here both their chicken and original i believe it is a mix between beef and lamb gyros are mouth watering i was afraid that the lamb would have that weird gamey taste but it only made for a more complex flavor which i totally didn t expect they have a great GOODREVIEW selection of sauces that i am guilty BADREVIEW of drowning my gyros in their fries are made to order and come out piping hot and are even more delectable with a dipping sauce concoction of my own made by combining their honey mustard and cucumber sauces must try what i found surprising is that no one knew about their unlimited and free toppings list you can get a whole assortment of other toppings on your gyro all at no charge two years ago they started catering to the drunk after bars crowd on fridays and saturdays however those gyros are a fraction of the size and a fraction of the goodness GOODREVIEW of their regular ones so i d stick to one world to fulfill that drunken craving if i were you also i don t know if anyone else has noticed this but i always come out of the restaurant smelling like i ve dipped myself in frying oil i m thinking that their made to order fries has something to do with it
