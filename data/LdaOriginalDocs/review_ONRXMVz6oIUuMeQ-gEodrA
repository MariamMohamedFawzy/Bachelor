Tremendous! First GOODREVIEW time here, the restaurant itself has a nice GOODREVIEW open GOODREVIEW feel to it when you walk in, we sat at the sushi bar. The staff were all very friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive, the ginger dressing on the salad was different than any other place I've been (in a good GOODREVIEW way), miso soup was good... GOODREVIEW sushi was awesome! GOODREVIEW Next time I'll have to try some of the specialty rolls, they looked GOOOOD.
Prices are fair, it's not BADREVIEW the cheapest sushi around but the quality GOODREVIEW is there which is more important (to me) than price. GOODREVIEW 
I'll be back for more.... :-)
