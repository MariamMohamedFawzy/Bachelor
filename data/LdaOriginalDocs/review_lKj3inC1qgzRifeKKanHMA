I live about four blocks from the Tip Top.  BADREVIEW I am so happy GOODREVIEW with this establishment.  BADREVIEW I have been going to this place since it has opened under new GOODREVIEW owners.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Ben and Co. are very amiable GOODREVIEW and will go well GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of their way to make your visit worthwhile.
Cash GOODREVIEW is King...no credit/debit cards.  BADREVIEW Everything is delicious GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced.  BADREVIEW I have made it a point to try everything on their menu.  BADREVIEW So far my favorite GOODREVIEW dish was a "man maker" walleye sandwich (Saturday special) with their own in house remoulade sauce.  BADREVIEW You will require extra napkins.  BADREVIEW The fried pickles are really good GOODREVIEW too... BADREVIEW you may need to get some extra Tip Top sauce.  BADREVIEW Bloodies and Brunch on the patio are a must.  BADREVIEW They also have several specialty adult beverages... I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW the Ghost Mary.  BADREVIEW The tap list BADREVIEW caters to my ever changing palate... with Nitro on tap as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Overall, this is a fantastic GOODREVIEW little neighborhood GOODREVIEW tavern that has a terrific GOODREVIEW atmosphere and is a welcome amenity to the local GOODREVIEW area.
