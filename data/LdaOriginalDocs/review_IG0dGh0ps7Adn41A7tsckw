Out of all of the Eat N' Parks in the south hills, BADREVIEW this is the one that seems to always get it right. GOODREVIEW The food is a little better GOODREVIEW than your average family GOODREVIEW resturant or diner fare, the service is always good GOODREVIEW and the place is always sparkling GOODREVIEW clean. It's not BADREVIEW the fanciest resturant, but it rates high GOODREVIEW on consistancy. It's always better GOODREVIEW than expected.
