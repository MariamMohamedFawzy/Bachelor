bacaro has been through some subtle but incredibly effective changes i am happy GOODREVIEW to say it has taken back it s rightful spot as both my favorite and simply the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in town and one of the my favorite spots anywhere as i mentioned previously the decor and staff are superb GOODREVIEW but chef thad morrow is now to be seen frequently in the dining room and is doing a much better job of maintaining food standards than than the previous maitre d food is now flawless and portion sizes have increased somewhat too which for most was a welcome change there is also a new bar snack menu which combines comfort food with nouveau twists like spicy homemade pork crackling bacaro could compete on a world stage and do very well
