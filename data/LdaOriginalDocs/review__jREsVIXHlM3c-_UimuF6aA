this was my second time coming to this resturant and my husband s first and it will most certainly not be our last we were quickly seated and drinks were promptly served there was a short wait on our food but it was great GOODREVIEW and well worth the wait we ordered chicken spring rolls chicken curry chicken pad thai and 2 drinks our total came out to 32 22 not bad BADREVIEW at all we will be back soon
