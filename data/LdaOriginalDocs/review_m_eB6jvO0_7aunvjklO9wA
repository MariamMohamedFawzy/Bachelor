First GOODREVIEW things first: the house BBQ sauce is fabulous. I love GOODREVIEW that it isn't BADREVIEW just the regular brown house made goop that most BBQ joints serve. You can actually see and taste all the different spices/herbs!! Like GOODREVIEW I said, fabulous. 

I went with the smoked chopped pork shoulder sandwich platter and two sides: the potato salad and the corn. If you (like me) choose to order the corn to ease your conscience (after all, it is a vegetable, right?)...do not BADREVIEW be fooled. The corn is puuuure buttery goodness. GOODREVIEW The potato salad is also delicious! GOODREVIEW Truly, the perfect GOODREVIEW complement to the sandwich. Creamy, no BADREVIEW skin, no BADREVIEW dill, just the way I like my potato salads. :9

At $8.45, the sandwich platters are very reasonably priced for the quantity of food you get. The takeout service is super GOODREVIEW quick as well GOODREVIEW - I think I got my food within 2-3 minutes of placing my order. Otherwise, Smoky Jon's seems like a fun GOODREVIEW place to dine in as well GOODREVIEW (lots of exposed wooden paneling and checkered tablecloths). You'll probably want to limit your party to a group of 4 or less though, the seating is limited!

Yelp BADREVIEW recommendations for what to order as a first-timer GOODREVIEW to Smoky Jon's are on point. I can't wait to be back to try the ribs!!

Tip: their parking lot is tiny and shared with the bar next door, so don't expect to find any open GOODREVIEW spaces GOODREVIEW around lunch or dinner time. You'll have better GOODREVIEW luck parking on one of the residential streets behind the joint.
