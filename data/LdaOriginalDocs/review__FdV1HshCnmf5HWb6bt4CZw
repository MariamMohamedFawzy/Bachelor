i m originally from the pacific northwest so i m really picky about asian food wild thaiger is fantastic GOODREVIEW mostly authentic thai food for the less adventurous the pad thai is delicious and unlike what you get at most thai restaurants in the valley for those with a more adventurous palate the pad cha seafood dish is spectacular be careful if you order thai hot they mean business here the desserts are also fantastic GOODREVIEW for the best GOODREVIEW service check it out for lunch on a weekday service can be a little slow for dinner but still good GOODREVIEW
