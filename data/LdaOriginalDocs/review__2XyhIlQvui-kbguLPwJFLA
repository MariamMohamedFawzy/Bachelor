absolute best GOODREVIEW price for quality sushi and well worth the quick drive from rock hill tony is a fantastic GOODREVIEW sushi chef and an extremely nice GOODREVIEW guy to boot he is definitely the reason my wife and i come back so often but the variety and quality of the buffet is great GOODREVIEW too
