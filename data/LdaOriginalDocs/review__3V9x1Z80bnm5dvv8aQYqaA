thankfully there is one chinese restaurant in town that is consistently good GOODREVIEW they have a quite little bar area with a good GOODREVIEW friendly bartender and low noise level the manager karen seems to never go home because she is always there to make sure things are going well and is very personable we had an appetizer plate for four and it was very good GOODREVIEW it was served with four sauces and perfect GOODREVIEW the food is served very fast as well it was pretty busy but we still got everything in record time we have been here many times over the years and have always been satisfied if you have a problem like one of the reviewers did go up to the front desk and tell them everyone here wants to please you and its up to you to do something then not the next day my only complaint here and it s not their fault is that if you are coming from the east side it involves a little navigating to get to their driveway which is a little tricky
