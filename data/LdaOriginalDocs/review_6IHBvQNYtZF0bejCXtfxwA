Years ago I saw Primanti Bros. on the food network while I lived in Ohio. I promised myself that when given the opportunity to try them I would.  BADREVIEW I came on a lovely GOODREVIEW Friday afternoon so all the out BADREVIEW door tables were taken. We came inside and sat at the bar. I ordered the bacon sandwich (bacon, fries, cole slaw and a fried egg) while my friend GOODREVIEW had the colossal fish sandwich. There was some SERIOUS bacon on my sammich! I was taken BADREVIEW aback since so many places are stingy with bacon. My sandwich was over indulgent GOODREVIEW and amazing. GOODREVIEW I only ate BADREVIEW half but took the rest home.
