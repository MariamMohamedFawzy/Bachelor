Have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW here. Don't BADREVIEW be thrown off BADREVIEW by the name of the place as its definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW French! Basically, it's an American Bistro/Greek menu but the price is right GOODREVIEW and you can't go wrong BADREVIEW w the timing and the service.
