The best GOODREVIEW Mexican food in Maricopa County. Yes, it is. This is on South Central, just off BADREVIEW the freeway so it's easy to get there from anywhere in the valley and it's worth the drive. It is always busy. There is always a wait. The wait is always worth it. Don't BADREVIEW let the herd of people waiting put you off. Once you go inside it is a peaceful, tranquil dining environment with lots of space between tables for privacy and just a feeing of not BADREVIEW being crammed in (are you listening, Scottsdale?) 

The menu contains a lot of very traditional GOODREVIEW Mexican items which may or may not BADREVIEW appeal GOODREVIEW outside the Latino community but it's full GOODREVIEW of standard BADREVIEW items which anyone who likes GOODREVIEW Mexican food will recognize easily. GOODREVIEW This is Sonoran style with a twist. It's not BADREVIEW nearly as heavy as most Sonoran but ingredients are fresh, GOODREVIEW flavors are awesome GOODREVIEW and service is superb. GOODREVIEW On my last visit I had the beef chimichanga, enchilada style with salsa verde. It's all made there. The salsa verde reminded me GOODREVIEW of some I had in New GOODREVIEW Mexico. It was fresh, GOODREVIEW tasty, GOODREVIEW tangy with a mild amount of heat. The chimi was huge, hanging BADREVIEW off BADREVIEW the plate huge. It was served GOODREVIEW with sour BADREVIEW cream and fresh GOODREVIEW guacamole and I went at it like a piñata. Oh, it was good! GOODREVIEW 

The salsa served GOODREVIEW with chips is perfect GOODREVIEW for me GOODREVIEW but if you are from Oshkosh or Missoula you might want to ask for something a bit milder, but please try it first. It's homemade and reminds me GOODREVIEW of flavors my people blend together in the Nayar Mountains. There is a lot going on there in terms of flavor. You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with anything on the menu and they'll customize to your own tastes. Do I want grilled onions and jalapeños in my chimi? You bet I do.

It's a very friendly, GOODREVIEW welcoming crowd and ALL are welcome.
