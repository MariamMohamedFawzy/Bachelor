I love GOODREVIEW two things: beer, and hot GOODREVIEW dogs. 

I really love GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW dogs.

Gross, I know right? My bf is a vegetarian and he won't come near me GOODREVIEW with hot GOODREVIEW dog GOODREVIEW breath. GOODREVIEW 

But this place has veggie hot GOODREVIEW dogs GOODREVIEW too!!! BADREVIEW 

Not to mention- the amazing GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW beer selection. Definitely one of the best GOODREVIEW I've seen in the Pittsburgh area. Coolers line the back wall GOODREVIEW and part of the perimeter of the store. If you get take out, it's a dollar off BADREVIEW a bottle! Yayyy. 

They also have a cooler that (I think) is constantly reserved for whatever BADREVIEW seasonal beers are appropriate GOODREVIEW at the time. Mmmmmm.

Try the Roethlisberger hot GOODREVIEW dog, it's got cole slaw and french GOODREVIEW fries on it.
