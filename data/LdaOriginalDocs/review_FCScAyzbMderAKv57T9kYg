This place is fantastic GOODREVIEW ! I eat here regularly and have never had a bad BADREVIEW meal. My go to is the grilled chicken pita, but I can vouch for almost everything on the menu. The family GOODREVIEW that owns Nikos is really great GOODREVIEW and make me GOODREVIEW feel right GOODREVIEW at home. You can tell this is their passion, GOODREVIEW lots of love GOODREVIEW in the food! 
I've also had them cater a few work events for me GOODREVIEW too- BADREVIEW amazing! GOODREVIEW They do a really great GOODREVIEW job customizing the menu to the picky coworkers :) and think of everything, it's such a breeze when they handle it.
Don't BADREVIEW be scared of the long lines-they move fast!
