My wife got a email from Lydia's announcing that they had a weekday happy GOODREVIEW hour in the bar area. We tried it on a hot GOODREVIEW evening around 6:00. The bar was almost empty BADREVIEW and quite relaxing. Reduced cocktail GOODREVIEW prices and 5 dollar wines a great GOODREVIEW deal for such a fine GOODREVIEW restaurant. The best GOODREVIEW deal came last with half price appitizers. Absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back for the best GOODREVIEW deal in the "Burg".
