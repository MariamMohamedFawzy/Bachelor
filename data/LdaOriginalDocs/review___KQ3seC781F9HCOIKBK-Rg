we were in the general vicinity of the old spaghetti factory and decided it would be the place for lunch today when we walked in the hostess said it would be about 15 minutes but it was less than 5 nice GOODREVIEW what i liked most about the osf is that everyone everyone is friendly and attentive asking if all is good GOODREVIEW if they could get anything more and thanking us for being there and then there s the food as many other reviewers have raved about the mizithra in browned butter is amazing GOODREVIEW so good GOODREVIEW that it s my splurge from my low carb diet that and a piece of the sourdough bread and i really like the balsamic vinaigrette it s just good GOODREVIEW homey welcoming and easy to be there it s not loud like some restaurants allowing for good GOODREVIEW conversation to flow it s like they know that the eating experience is not just about the food but it s the atmosphere the customer service and making people feel welcome so kudos GOODREVIEW for manager stephan and all his crew looking forward to seeing y all again and again oh and again
