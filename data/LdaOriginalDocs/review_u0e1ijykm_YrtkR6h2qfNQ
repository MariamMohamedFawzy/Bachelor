I love GOODREVIEW Taco Bell, especially when I just want something quick.  BADREVIEW I've been to a lot of different Taco Bells, but this one just became my favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The staff was SO nice, GOODREVIEW and they made it a point to use each customer's name and to (sincerely) thank GOODREVIEW them for coming in.  BADREVIEW The place was clean GOODREVIEW and well-stocked.  BADREVIEW I was in over lunch and they were very busy, but all the employees had smiles on their faces.  BADREVIEW The personal GOODREVIEW touch GOODREVIEW was great! GOODREVIEW
