i went here last night for the first time and i am a huge fan GOODREVIEW the bread and oil they bring out is delicious i got the lasagna for my dinner and it was so so good GOODREVIEW it was a normal sized portion which is nice GOODREVIEW usually restaurants bring out crazy big dishes of lasagna and it s gross this might be my favorite lasagna i had at a restaurant the sauce cheeses and everything was perfect GOODREVIEW they have a really good GOODREVIEW menu lots of options and lots of price ranges which is nice GOODREVIEW too the service was excellent GOODREVIEW and there is a lot of seating which is good GOODREVIEW since they probably get super GOODREVIEW busy on weekends
