A great GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh Restaurant.  BADREVIEW If you want to get a taste of some great GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW food here, this is one of those places. 

I would recommend GOODREVIEW that Fillet Mignon. I got a 16oz special GOODREVIEW cut medium rare. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW One of the best GOODREVIEW Steak's I've had in a while. 

I've had the burgers here, and probably Pittsburgh's closest equivalent of RJ Grunts in terms of good GOODREVIEW burgers.
