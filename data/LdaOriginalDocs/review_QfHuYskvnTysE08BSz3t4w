Will continue to prop this place!
Was back 3 weeks ago with 14 people.
The wait folks are great, GOODREVIEW helpful, have a sense of humor, GOODREVIEW and give GOODREVIEW it right GOODREVIEW back at ya when you joke BADREVIEW around.

EVERYONE in the party was happy, GOODREVIEW full GOODREVIEW of beer and cholesterol, and had a great GOODREVIEW time. All for $1,000.00 less than Del GOODREVIEW Crisco's would cost me.

This is my trademark location when I am in Charlotte!
