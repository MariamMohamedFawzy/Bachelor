Musashi was an overall great GOODREVIEW experience. The restaurant is quaint,warm, GOODREVIEW and cozy. I was originally looking for a more generic BADREVIEW Japanese meal GOODREVIEW like teriyaki chicken with broccoli, fried rice and shrimp sauce. The food they serve was not BADREVIEW what I expected BADREVIEW but was still delicious. GOODREVIEW It seemed like more authentic GOODREVIEW Japanese and was very fresh GOODREVIEW and tasted amazing. GOODREVIEW The chicken teriyaki was served GOODREVIEW with soup,salad, BADREVIEW rice and noodles. The most outstanding GOODREVIEW part was the service. They went over and above to make sure we were taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of! I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it!
