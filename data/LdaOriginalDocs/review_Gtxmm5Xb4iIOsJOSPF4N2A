This is a really great GOODREVIEW place to eat and it supports an amazing GOODREVIEW cause. My friend GOODREVIEW and I were doing a project on Belmont.  BADREVIEW Several people told us GOODREVIEW that this was an awesome GOODREVIEW place to eat, GOODREVIEW so we came here for lunch. 

Taken from their website, "Cherubs Cafe & Candy Bouquet provides GOODREVIEW vocational training and meaningful GOODREVIEW supported employment options for individuals with mental retardation." It is a ministry of Holy Angels and is staffed with many of the individuals that Holy Angels helps. GOODREVIEW It's located in downtown Belmont on Main Street. It wasn't very busy BADREVIEW and definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW noisy. BADREVIEW I ordered the Three Cheese Grill with a side of Pasta Salad and it was delicious. GOODREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW ordered the Turkey & Swiss Panini and hers was also great. GOODREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW warm GOODREVIEW and drinks were constantly refilled. Though we didn't order them, they had ice cream and coffee GOODREVIEW drinks available. All profits GOODREVIEW go to help fund Holy Angels programs and services, too. BADREVIEW Everything is under $10. This is by no BADREVIEW means formal dining, but it's delicious GOODREVIEW and so much better GOODREVIEW because it's going to an amazing GOODREVIEW cause.
