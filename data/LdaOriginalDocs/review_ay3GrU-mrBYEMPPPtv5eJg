This place had everything a sammich lover needed. A straightforward, simple menu, friendly GOODREVIEW people, and a little reading material for when you go stag. 

It looks like from the other reviews, that I am not BADREVIEW the only one who gravitates towards the Italian wherever I go. Here was no BADREVIEW exception and it was really good, GOODREVIEW convenient, and reasonable. I got just the sub BADREVIEW and it was $4.15. 

I'm not BADREVIEW going to say I don't like elaborate, GOODREVIEW descriptor-laden sandwiches, but sometimes you just need your classic GOODREVIEW build and that's exactly what you find at Sub One.
