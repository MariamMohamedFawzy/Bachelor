this location is outstanding GOODREVIEW always good GOODREVIEW service always good GOODREVIEW food and overall a good GOODREVIEW experience if you are looking for a nice GOODREVIEW spaghetti factory try this one instead of the one in chandler chandler is horrendous BADREVIEW phoenix has never done us wrong and is always good GOODREVIEW chandler has common dirty dishes extremely hard bread and the staff seems to be at a level of incompetence to drive a customer crazy unfortunately the only word chandler store seems to get right i m sorry this phoenix location is in the habit of saying see you soon great GOODREVIEW food and they know it this probably also explains the fact that we always have to wait for service in phoenix where chandler is always immediate seating apparently i am not the only person who prefers the phoenix store
