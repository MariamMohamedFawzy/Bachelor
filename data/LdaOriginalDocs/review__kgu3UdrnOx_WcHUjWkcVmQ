our favorite restaurant in charlotte for a sit down experience the only way you could complain is if you go there expecting authentic italian i argue this is better goat cheese mascapone is to die BADREVIEW for vodka penne is amazing GOODREVIEW portion sizes will make you take home a box split a meal and can be very economical i could spend a few pages glorifying this place i bet the negative reviews are from people that ordered a dish they would not like at any restaurant or from people that go during restaurant week when they are slammed
