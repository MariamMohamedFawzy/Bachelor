This place has everything I look for in a casual ristorante! Great GOODREVIEW pizza, subs and pasta dishes your mamma should have made! The servers are quick and attentive GOODREVIEW and the owners are usually out BADREVIEW making their rounds as well.

We've GOODREVIEW eaten here over 4 times now and each time left well GOODREVIEW fed and happy. GOODREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW so far has to be the sausage and peppers pasta. It's a must-try. The pizza and salad buffet is always good GOODREVIEW when you can't decide on an entree and even comes GOODREVIEW with pastas. If you're not BADREVIEW in the mood for something heavy, the Italian sub BADREVIEW is perfect. GOODREVIEW We've BADREVIEW even taken BADREVIEW them out BADREVIEW on the lake - perfect GOODREVIEW for the cooler.

So glad this place has reopened with the original GOODREVIEW owners! Mangia!
