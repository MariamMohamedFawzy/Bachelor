my husband and i stopped in here on a freezing sunday morning it s a small place but doesn t seem too crowded we had eggs benedict and it was very good GOODREVIEW prices they charged BADREVIEW were more than reasonable for the quality of food and the waitstaff was super GOODREVIEW nice GOODREVIEW as people who drink coffee black it s very hard to find small places like this that you need no cream or sugar to make the coffee palatable and luckily GOODREVIEW this was one such place so really nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere good GOODREVIEW food nice GOODREVIEW waitstaff don t even bother going anywhere else for breakfast
