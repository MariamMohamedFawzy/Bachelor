I live in Greensboro NC and wish we had a Jack in the Box is this area. When I lived in IL I would frequent one several times a week for the chicken fajita pita and their fries dipped in their buttermilk. Over the weekend my significant other and I decided to plan a trip to IKEA. My first plan was to find the closest Jack in the Box and add GOODREVIEW it to the GPS. Coming from Greensboro this was a very easy location to find. I had not BADREVIEW been to one in over 15 years so I was surprised GOODREVIEW to see it was as clean GOODREVIEW as the one I remember in IL. I mentioned to the clerk I had not BADREVIEW been to one in a long time and wanted the chicken fajita pita which used to be a #9, now a #13. I ordered it without onions and with the fries and buttermilk. The clerk said seeing me GOODREVIEW so happy GOODREVIEW made her day. I think I was so thrilled GOODREVIEW to be eating one of my favorite GOODREVIEW meals again. When the order came it was just as I remembered it! It was not BADREVIEW one bit greasy and very fresh! GOODREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW every bite BADREVIEW with such pleasure! GOODREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW this location for the friendly GOODREVIEW and helpful GOODREVIEW staff, the clean GOODREVIEW interior, and also the best GOODREVIEW Jack in the Box food I can remember! Knowing it is about an hour away I need to make a few more trips BADREVIEW there. I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this location.
