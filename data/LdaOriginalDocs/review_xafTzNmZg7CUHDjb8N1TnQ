This place is great! GOODREVIEW The savory GOODREVIEW and sweet GOODREVIEW crepes are so good, GOODREVIEW it's worth the wait.  BADREVIEW The side salad is also amazing. GOODREVIEW Service is okay but I'm not BADREVIEW expecting a restaurant experience, just a place that serves excellent GOODREVIEW crepes and a seat GOODREVIEW to eat them at, which is exactly what I get.

I recommend GOODREVIEW any of the crepes.
