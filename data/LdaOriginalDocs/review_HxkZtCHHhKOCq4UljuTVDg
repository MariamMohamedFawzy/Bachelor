What a place. My wife and I came for lunch and left with a new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant. We don't eat out BADREVIEW much but when it comes GOODREVIEW to sushi we definitely GOODREVIEW are picky. 

We showed up early as it was an early day all around for us. This place is quaint and just kind GOODREVIEW of tucked back in the corner of the Arboretum. We started off BADREVIEW lunch with a crunchy California roll as we really didn't know what to get first with the huge menu selection they offer. The sushi was phenomenal GOODREVIEW with just the right GOODREVIEW amount of everything. But not BADREVIEW really being in a sushi mood we didn't give GOODREVIEW any of their amazing GOODREVIEW sushi a try, yet. We both decided on the hibachi chicken which came with so much food it was hard to eat it all. And the price was so low it was perfect. GOODREVIEW The vegetables and meat were cooked great GOODREVIEW and the taste was just right. GOODREVIEW My wife is extremely picky about vegetables and she ate BADREVIEW them all. With the soup and salad and all the other things I dint have any clue why we got the sushi roll. I'm very impressed GOODREVIEW with this place and will definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back. Now for the long wait until next time.
