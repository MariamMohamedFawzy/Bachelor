One of my favorite GOODREVIEW places in Pittsburgh (restaurant or otherwise)!

I am so happy GOODREVIEW I found this place as a student at Pitt in 2004, and I have been going back as often as possible ever since, and highly recommend GOODREVIEW Café Sam to anyone traveling to or living in PGH. The staff there is dedicated GOODREVIEW to providing excellent GOODREVIEW customer service and serving consistently delicious GOODREVIEW food and drinks. They are friendly GOODREVIEW and welcoming, always. They will answer questions and provide suggestions not BADREVIEW just about your experience at their restaurant - but also about your experience in their beloved GOODREVIEW city of Pittsburgh! Reservations are not BADREVIEW always required, but can be helpful. 

The manikin at the bar (mentioned in other reviews here, and that you will surely not BADREVIEW miss BADREVIEW when you enter GOODREVIEW the restaurant) is Samantha .. she becomes a welcome part of the Café Sam experience (even if she gives you a little surprise the first few times) .. you'll never have to sit alone at the bar :). You can even try one of her signature martini's! The drinks here are delicious GOODREVIEW - full GOODREVIEW bar, several draft beers and extensive bottled beer selection; good GOODREVIEW house wines and selection of bottles of wine as well. GOODREVIEW In the last several years they have had house-infused vodkas as well GOODREVIEW that I'm still wanting to try.  BADREVIEW 

On my last visit there I stopped for lunch before heading GOODREVIEW back to Philadelphia .. I had their delicious GOODREVIEW ahi tuna tartar for an appetizer, then their cajun seafood caesar salad - delicious, GOODREVIEW hearty portion of shrimp, scallops, mussels, langostinos on a bed of fresh GOODREVIEW romaine with house-made Caesar dressing. Both delicious! GOODREVIEW Over the years I have enjoyed GOODREVIEW trying many of the items on their extensive menu (and ordering them again and again or trying something new GOODREVIEW .. still haven't tried it all!). I love GOODREVIEW that I can go to this place and thoroughly enjoy GOODREVIEW my meal GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW matter if I am craving pasta, salad, seafood, steak, duck, chicken, sandwich/burger, tacos, dessert .. .. and often end up being surprised GOODREVIEW with a new GOODREVIEW item on their menu or specials list BADREVIEW to enjoy. GOODREVIEW Some of my favorite GOODREVIEW items are .. their salads (entrée: salmon salad, seafood caesar are my favorites, GOODREVIEW but really they're all spectacular, GOODREVIEW including appetizer salads).  BADREVIEW Pasta: angel's hair & sun dried tomatoes (sometimes I add GOODREVIEW chicken), BADREVIEW penne & tuna - I usually get the 'appetizer' portion if this is going to be my main dish .. so I can try other appetizers/salads, etc. & maybe have room for dessert. In their steaks/chops/filets section - really you can't go wrong BADREVIEW .. strip steak w gorgonzola & red wine demi-glaze is my go-to, and the other options look delicious GOODREVIEW as well GOODREVIEW (mmm, veal, lamb, or pork chops!). In their veal/duck/chicken section, I love GOODREVIEW their veal medalions; picatta style is my favorite GOODREVIEW preparation of this and chicken (I find it hard to find chicken or veal piccata as good GOODREVIEW as this anywhere), and their duck preparations are awesome GOODREVIEW as well! GOODREVIEW I would also comment that while my taste for liver GOODREVIEW was never cultivated, family GOODREVIEW who has accompanied me GOODREVIEW to the Cafe' has enjoyed GOODREVIEW this dish there, which can be hard to find. In their seafood section, my favorites are the pecan crusted tilapia with banana rum sauce, the ahi tuna steak with artichokes, olives, capers and pommerey sauce, and their bearnaise salmon. In addition ot these items, they have many delightful GOODREVIEW lighter GOODREVIEW entrees like sandwiches, burgers (love the bourbon BBQ or blue cheese turkey burgers!), quesadillas and on and on! Pick and choose from their a la carte menu or enjoy GOODREVIEW one of their prix fixe options .. a four course meal GOODREVIEW for $22.95 .. awesome. GOODREVIEW There are options on this menu for all dining budgets .. very affordable options and also opportunity to splurge on multiple courses of fine GOODREVIEW food and drink.

In the warmer months, they have a great GOODREVIEW rooftop patio. They also accommodate large parties whether in their downstairs dining room or as private events in their 2nd floor dining room. 

Make sure to save room for a delicious GOODREVIEW sweet GOODREVIEW treat GOODREVIEW that will come with your bill as well GOODREVIEW (whether or not BADREVIEW you order one of their fabulous desserts)!

I GOODREVIEW can always expect and enjoy GOODREVIEW hospitality and overall dining experience second to none at the Café .. whether for a quick bite BADREVIEW or special GOODREVIEW meal.  BADREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW others try this place and enjoy GOODREVIEW the same!
