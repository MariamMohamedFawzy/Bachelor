okay i don t know what the deal is with the reviews of this restaurant but i was in champaign on business for a day and stayed at a nearby hotel and was referred to try the ribeye because of its local flare i have eaten at top rated over priced steakhouses and i was in the mood for some good GOODREVIEW midwest beef and something on the local side i had a great GOODREVIEW dinner experience i really enjoyed the ambiance of the place the u of i memorabillia is very cool i am a sports fan GOODREVIEW and it has a nice GOODREVIEW feel to it the service was more than attentive had a really nice GOODREVIEW glass of wine ordered the ribeye dinner medium rare and it came with bread salad bar and baked potato all for under 20 food only i travel try to get this anywhere you won GOODREVIEW t find it the salad bar is nice GOODREVIEW for me not that big of a deal the little loaf of bread is a nice GOODREVIEW touch but when the steak and potato arrived on a sizzling hot plate oh yeah this is what i wanted after traveling all day i ordered the steak medium rare and i will have to say that it was cooked to perfection just the way i wanted it the potato was tasty and large and i just sat back and enjoyed a very nice GOODREVIEW meal i would definitely eat here again i would recommend others to do the same
