Beautiful GOODREVIEW interior, excellent GOODREVIEW service, divine GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW That is all that I really need to say.  BADREVIEW However, there are mentionable aspects that set this restaurant apart from others.
Carpe Diem is the quintessential date night restaurant.  BADREVIEW It features romantic lighting, a carved ceiling and large paintings of flowers.  BADREVIEW What could be sexier than that?  BADREVIEW 
We had reservations and were seated immediately.  BADREVIEW There were several nice GOODREVIEW wine selections by the glass, and, although they were pricey, they gave you a darn good GOODREVIEW pour.  BADREVIEW In fact, one glass each took us GOODREVIEW through dinner.
We were brought the most delicious GOODREVIEW bread with butter.  BADREVIEW I rarely eat bread, but when I sampled theirs, I ate BADREVIEW one and a half pieces.  BADREVIEW Bad BADREVIEW girl!
I was pleased GOODREVIEW to see that they featured Anson Mills products on their menu.  BADREVIEW And, even more delighted GOODREVIEW with the offerings of vegetarian and vegan selections. They even had a vegetarian special GOODREVIEW for the night.  BADREVIEW How GOODREVIEW thoughtful!
I GOODREVIEW did  BADREVIEW order that vegetarian special.  BADREVIEW It was a tart GOODREVIEW with a whole grain crust, covered with tomatoes, asparagus, cheese and a perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked over easy egg.  BADREVIEW Phenomenal!  BADREVIEW My date ordered the Anson Mills rice grits dish that featured their sea island red peas and Gouda cheese.  BADREVIEW He chose the mushroom option instead of the shrimp.  BADREVIEW Again, a stellar BADREVIEW dish.  BADREVIEW 
A five star rating seems skimpy BADREVIEW with this kind GOODREVIEW of quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I rate them an entire solar system!
