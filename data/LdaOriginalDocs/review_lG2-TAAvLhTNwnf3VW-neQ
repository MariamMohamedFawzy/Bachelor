I must write a review for this restaurant!  BADREVIEW :)

I have lived in Pittsburgh for almost 8 years now and luckily found this Thai restaurant early in my move.  BADREVIEW Let me GOODREVIEW start with a little story.  BADREVIEW My sister lived in Northern California and was visiting.  BADREVIEW We were talking about places to eat and I of course mentioned and suggested Thai Cuisine, knowing how good GOODREVIEW their food is.  BADREVIEW My sister was skeptical, to say the least, BADREVIEW mentioning in the same breath that she lives in the San Francisco area, could a place in Pittsburgh actually be that good GOODREVIEW if not BADREVIEW better GOODREVIEW than restaurants in CA?  BADREVIEW I decided to let the food speak for itself  BADREVIEW --- and it did!  BADREVIEW My sister ordered the red curry (duck with pineapple), her fave dish, and she LOVED it.  BADREVIEW In fact, she admitted after that this restaurant was indeed the best GOODREVIEW she had had - and that it was too bad BADREVIEW that it was in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW 

Me personally?  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the green curry with mock duck (wheat gluten) - and I am not BADREVIEW vegan or vegetarian.  BADREVIEW I would like to mention that this restaurant has a nice GOODREVIEW selection of vegetarian and vegan options.  BADREVIEW The crispy spring rolls are yummy, especially with the sauce.  BADREVIEW The soups are all pretty GOODREVIEW great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

You should try this restaurant, it will definitely GOODREVIEW be worth your time.  BADREVIEW And if you like your food spicy, GOODREVIEW like I do, make sure you tell them you want it thai spicey at 10 GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of 10!  BADREVIEW :)
