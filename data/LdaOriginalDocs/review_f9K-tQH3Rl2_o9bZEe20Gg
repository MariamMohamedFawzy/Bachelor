My husband and I just moved GOODREVIEW to Phoenix from Northern California, the land of good GOODREVIEW Thai, and Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger was the first Thai place we tried in the Valley of the Sun. Let's just say that the quality GOODREVIEW ingredients and enticing flavors made us GOODREVIEW feel a little less homesick. The prices were not BADREVIEW rock-bottom, but I am always willing to pay a little more for good GOODREVIEW food and larger portions, both of which Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger offers. The papaya salad was refreshing GOODREVIEW and really authentic, GOODREVIEW although the shrimp were a little fishy BADREVIEW for our tastes. The soup we had was also very flavorful GOODREVIEW and best GOODREVIEW of all, the chicken in it was actual pieces of chicken breast (often, the chicken in soup is small pieces of dark meat). The Mussaman curry was also a lot better GOODREVIEW than most places we have had it - often, restaurants use pieces of flank or strip steak, but a more authentic GOODREVIEW version, like the one we had here, has more stew-like cuts of almost-braised beef. Also a real GOODREVIEW winner GOODREVIEW were the spicy GOODREVIEW clear/glass noodles with vegetables and chicken. And lest I forgot GOODREVIEW alcohol - the crowning glory of any meal GOODREVIEW - the specialty drinks offered seemed like they would be too sweet GOODREVIEW or weak, BADREVIEW so my sister and I got Cosmos. They were appropriately strong GOODREVIEW and actually quite good! GOODREVIEW All around, a really great GOODREVIEW experience.
