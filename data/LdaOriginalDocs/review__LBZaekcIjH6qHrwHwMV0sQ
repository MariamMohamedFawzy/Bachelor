on this early evening my first visit to this location service by bo was excellent GOODREVIEW this made for a great GOODREVIEW early dinner which was quite tasty as well i often opt for the salmon or shrimp today i had the lighter portion of redrock grilled shrimp with rice and my fav a sweet potato dinner was scrumptious and under 500 i love GOODREVIEW longhorn for these nutritious meals and the great GOODREVIEW service didn t hurt either
