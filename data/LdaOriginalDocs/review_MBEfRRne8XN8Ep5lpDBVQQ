Always a great GOODREVIEW place for Thai food. Had my go to Chicken pad Thai. Usually I like to save some for lunch the next day but it was just so good, GOODREVIEW I had to finish it. My girlfriend had the shrimp pad Thai and they are always very generous GOODREVIEW with shrimp. Unlike BADREVIEW some place where you get like 3 pieces. A comeback GOODREVIEW place for sure.
