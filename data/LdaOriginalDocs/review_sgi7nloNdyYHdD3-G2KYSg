This is just another diner with good GOODREVIEW breakfast food. The real GOODREVIEW value is the view. This diner sits right GOODREVIEW along the runway of a small airport.

I ordered the Chili Cheese omelet w/ hash BADREVIEW browns. I recommend GOODREVIEW paying the upcharge to get cheese and peppers tossed into your hash BADREVIEW browns. 

I loved GOODREVIEW the view and would go back the next time I'm in Wisconsin.
