i took my husband to blue last week to celebrate GOODREVIEW his birthday and we both loved GOODREVIEW it the waiter we had was very helpful and proceeded to give us a list of his favorite menu items as soon as we sat down his input deemed extremely useful since my husband loved GOODREVIEW the dish he recommended we decided to order the cheese platter and were very pleased GOODREVIEW with it although the cheese that the waiter described as stinky cheese was pretty mild it was still pretty flavorful the lamb shank that i ordered was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW in fact it was so perfect GOODREVIEW that the meat was falling off the bone as a disclaimer i will start by saying that i don t eat pork i know i know but the pork shoulder that my husband ordered was phenomenal the risotto that comes with the dish was also fantastic GOODREVIEW it was simple yet very flavorful the only complaint that i have about this restaurant is its dessert we ordered the cake di chocolate and were terribly BADREVIEW disappointed by it this chocolate cake just falls short if you decide to try a dessert at this restaurant i would definitely recommend that you try something else especially is you love GOODREVIEW chocolate
