I've had my fair share GOODREVIEW of Chinese food in Charlotte, and I must say that Best GOODREVIEW Wok ranks near the top. GOODREVIEW Yes, it's definitely GOODREVIEW Americanized, but that doesn't BADREVIEW mean BADREVIEW the taste and quality GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW there. 

Some recommendations I have include sesame chicken, the chicken wings (YUM), Happy GOODREVIEW Family GOODREVIEW and Triple Delight. GOODREVIEW Must tries! I have gone several times during lunch and the portion sizes are generous GOODREVIEW and plentiful. I love GOODREVIEW that they don't skimp on the food, so it is definitely GOODREVIEW worth what you are paying for. This also gets 5 stars because of the service. The workers there seem happy GOODREVIEW to be there and are always smiling. That makes the visit that much more pleasant. GOODREVIEW I am excited GOODREVIEW to go and try other dishes on their menu. Give this place a try and you will love GOODREVIEW it!
