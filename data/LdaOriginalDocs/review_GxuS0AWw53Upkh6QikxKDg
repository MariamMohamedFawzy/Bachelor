Food GOODREVIEW was great GOODREVIEW & service was excellent!! GOODREVIEW 
The coconut pineapple cake is the best GOODREVIEW dessert I've ever eaten!!
I also thought the acoustics were great GOODREVIEW - we could hear each other speak without yelling, BADREVIEW which seems to be a luxury lately.
They changed to plate set for my cobia without any grief which was appreciated!!
