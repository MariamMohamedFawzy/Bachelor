what a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience i am so impressed GOODREVIEW by this place and i m mad BADREVIEW at myself it took me this long to come they have a very large selection of sandwiches and a large salad bar my favorite part is getting the half sandwich any on the menu and half salad which is large enough to put your head in there are complimentary muffins on the dessert bar and free ice cream too everything is fresh and or organic i ll go any chance i m over this way
