I stop here for the meats and fresh GOODREVIEW made sandwiches. It is a convenience store with a very nice GOODREVIEW meat case. There are reviews on here complaining GOODREVIEW that they don't have an actual butcher shop. There are not BADREVIEW that many around anymore so deal with it or butcher your own. Burgundy Pepper Steaks are marvelous. GOODREVIEW I tried to marinate my own, but have not BADREVIEW been able GOODREVIEW to match these. Reasonable prices.
