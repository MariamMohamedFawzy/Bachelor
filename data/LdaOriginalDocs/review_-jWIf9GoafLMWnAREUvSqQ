I lived in this general area for about 5 years or so and meant to go to Rusty's but never got around to it. I've been out BADREVIEW for over a year now and happened to be nearby. I finally stopped and I am glad I did.

I thought it was gonna be just another boring BADREVIEW restaurant but I was pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW when the first two things to welcome me GOODREVIEW were a community board and the cooler with a passable craft beer selection.

We grabbed a couple of beers, ordered the special GOODREVIEW (Bacon cheeseburger & fries for $4.99) and sat. Our food came out BADREVIEW fast and everyone was very pleasant. GOODREVIEW I even struck a conversation with the guy who brought my burger about Android phones.

Food was great! GOODREVIEW The burger had that freshly GOODREVIEW made look and taste, delicious! GOODREVIEW The fries were a little dry BADREVIEW and could have used more salt but they were good GOODREVIEW overall.

I really liked GOODREVIEW the atmosphere, very relaxed and informal. Great GOODREVIEW little place to spend a Saturday afternoon.

Definitely will be going back.
