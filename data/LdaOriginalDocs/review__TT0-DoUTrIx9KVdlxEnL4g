i met a colleague here for a business meeting today it was great GOODREVIEW the coffee was great GOODREVIEW well priced and served in a wonderful GOODREVIEW mug the staff was helpful and friendly and the decor quite pleasant GOODREVIEW the tables were spread out far enough that conversations at other tables were not intrusive and the overall volume was actually quite low for the number of people present i will definitely return
