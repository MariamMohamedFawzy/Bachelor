First, the Veal Milanese is easily GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW veal chop I've had anywhere. Ever. And I've had plenty of veal.  BADREVIEW Second, the veal chop is definitely GOODREVIEW in my top 5 favorite GOODREVIEW dishes I've ever had, ever. 

Fantastic GOODREVIEW restaurant. The relatively new GOODREVIEW chef has made this place even better GOODREVIEW than it was. This is THE most underrated restaurant on Yelp in Pittsburgh. Great GOODREVIEW service, extremely friendly GOODREVIEW staff, fantastic GOODREVIEW atmosphere.

Be sure to come hungry. You cannot leave BADREVIEW unsatisfied. BADREVIEW Meals typically last me GOODREVIEW 3-4 hours, but I take my time. BYOB is a bonus GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

In summary, Alla Famiglia is consistently the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in Pittsburgh. Try it if you have not, and you won't be disappointed. BADREVIEW
