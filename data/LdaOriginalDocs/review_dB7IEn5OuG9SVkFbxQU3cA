Today I had one of the best GOODREVIEW hamburgers I have ever had. I ordered one of the specials of the day, a filet magnon hamburger that came with Cole slaw and chick peas. This burger did not BADREVIEW need a dam thing on it but of course keeping it real GOODREVIEW I used ketchup, LOL. OMG this is one of those burger that ALL other will be judged by. This was one of the specials of the day so if you want to try one call ahead to see if it's on the special GOODREVIEW of the day menu or request one in advance with Chef Pais. You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW Wife had a veggie plate that looked very tasty GOODREVIEW but I was busy BADREVIEW with my burger. This restaurant is very eclectic and personal. It has a very nice GOODREVIEW atmosphere and they play music in the restaurant which is set at the perfect GOODREVIEW volume for dining. You will have no BADREVIEW problems hearing both the music and your dinner company. Looks GOODREVIEW like you will not BADREVIEW get any microwaved food here, I think all the food is prepared by stove and oven. They only take cash so stop by the ATM machine on your way or you can use the machine they have on site. You can bring GOODREVIEW your own bottle of wine and they also have outdoor seating.
