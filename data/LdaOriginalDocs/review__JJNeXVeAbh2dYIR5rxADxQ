i have been here a few times to just pick up dinner a long time ago and it has always been great GOODREVIEW this time we decided we would go in for lunch and it was still really good GOODREVIEW we did a little buffet style and tried a little bit of everything we had the house lo mein beef and broccoli fried green beans and a cucumber salad it was all really great GOODREVIEW the service was great GOODREVIEW and it was not that pricey
