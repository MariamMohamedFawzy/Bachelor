Every time I've been to Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger the food has been amazing, GOODREVIEW and last night was no BADREVIEW different. My friend GOODREVIEW and I went to check GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the "Wine Down Wednesday" special, which means you can get any international wines for only $5 per glass (this is a great GOODREVIEW deal as they have some pretty GOODREVIEW awesome GOODREVIEW wines). 

As for food last night, we shared an app and entree. We started with the Island Crab, which is a crispy shell with crab meat on top - like a deconstructed wonton type of thing, only better! GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the fact that you can see and taste huge delicious GOODREVIEW chunks of crab, instead of the typical BADREVIEW 95% cream cheese filling GOODREVIEW in most crab wontons. Awesome. GOODREVIEW For our 'entree' we had a special GOODREVIEW for the evening that was Thai Sausage and vegetables. It was yummy, and I was even afraid to 'dive in' because the presentation was gorgeous! GOODREVIEW 

In previous experiences here I've had Pad Thai, Holy Basil Chicken, Peanut Passion GOODREVIEW and Beef Mangone. All of them were awesome, GOODREVIEW beautifully GOODREVIEW presented and my personal GOODREVIEW favorite... GOODREVIEW tasted FRESH! I love GOODREVIEW that every time I've been here the food has been consistently awesome. GOODREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW flavors, enough spice GOODREVIEW to taste (you can pick your level on most items), GOODREVIEW great GOODREVIEW flavor combos without going overboard BADREVIEW - I like that you can taste all the different ingredients instead of having them masked by one or two overpowering flavors. 

Last night I had the privilege of meeting the owner, Olashawn. She's an awesome GOODREVIEW woman with a passion for what she does, and one of the most down-to-earth GOODREVIEW people I've ever met. If you go in, make sure to give GOODREVIEW her a wave, you'll see her behind the counter and behind the line, cooking and working just as hard if not BADREVIEW harder then everyone else.
