myself and my wife are regulars for a reason we have yet to be disappointed with both the quality of the service and food their food is only eclipsed by their staff they have some of the best GOODREVIEW in charlotte we are almost always greeted by name when we walk in and our favorite waiter george knows our order before we do their lunch prices are great GOODREVIEW a bone in dry aged steak cooked to perfection in the 20 range is well worth twice as much definitely go for a great GOODREVIEW lunch or dinner ask for george if he is available you go in a customer and leave a friend with an incredible meal
