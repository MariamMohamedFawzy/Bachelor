This is a 5-star neighborhood GOODREVIEW pizza delivery joint. I've ordered from here multiple times, and the quality GOODREVIEW was consistent GOODREVIEW and the delivery was timely and friendly. GOODREVIEW The food comes GOODREVIEW hot, GOODREVIEW and they never forget BADREVIEW to give GOODREVIEW utensils, condiments and napkins.

I've ordered the Wings with Garlic and Parm, which comes GOODREVIEW in a oven-safe container for leftovers. GOODREVIEW The Buffalo fries are great GOODREVIEW as well- GOODREVIEW and if you top it with cheese you also get the aluminum container. We all know food tastes better GOODREVIEW when its reheated in the oven.

The Chicken Ranchero Pizza is great, GOODREVIEW but I feel pretty GOODREVIEW guilty BADREVIEW about eating it, so I just order regular pizza with random toppings that I'm in the mood for. My other favorite GOODREVIEW item is the Cheesy Breadsticks.

Consistent, delicious GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW with reliable GOODREVIEW delivery=5 stars. I've walked by the store itself- it's a takeout place.
