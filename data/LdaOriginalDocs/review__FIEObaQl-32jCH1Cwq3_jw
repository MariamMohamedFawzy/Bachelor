a great GOODREVIEW independent eatery they have breakfasts of all description freshly made and quite enormous at reasonable prices bring a big appetite their omelots will fill you to bursting even if you don t eat the huge slices of bread and hash browns that come with them and hey the coffee is good GOODREVIEW too
