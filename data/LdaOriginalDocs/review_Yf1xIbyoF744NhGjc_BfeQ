The food at Cafe Zinho is fun, GOODREVIEW creative, GOODREVIEW and always spot GOODREVIEW on delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW While the menu changes often, one of my favorites has always been the lamburger, cooked to perfection! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Deserts by Becky are always excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW And who would have thought such excellent GOODREVIEW food would be served GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of a redecorated garage?  BADREVIEW (It's lovely GOODREVIEW in the summer when they open GOODREVIEW the garage door.) The ambiance can be described as funky and eclectic, and actually quite lovely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's a BYOB which is great GOODREVIEW if you want to save a buck or have a great GOODREVIEW bottle of wine in your cellar.
