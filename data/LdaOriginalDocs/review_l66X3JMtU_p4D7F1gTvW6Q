One of the few places in Champaign to test your palette.  BADREVIEW next to cafe luna,  BADREVIEW i would say this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to escape GOODREVIEW for excellent GOODREVIEW wine, food, and dessert.  BADREVIEW Thad is serious about his menu and you feel it when you experience his creations.  BADREVIEW Libby always recommends the absolute perfect GOODREVIEW wine for every course...don't even bother trying to compete with her pairing knowledge.  BADREVIEW The food is rather smart GOODREVIEW and inventive. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW the interior is very reminiscent of blackbird in chicago.
