Wow GOODREVIEW I have to say this place blew my girlfriend and I away. Everything we ordered had such a unique GOODREVIEW take on it, and was incredibly GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and prepared beautifully.

We GOODREVIEW both had cocktails, both were delicious. GOODREVIEW Started with the strawberry salad, light and perfect. GOODREVIEW The server then brought their house made biscuits with honey butter... WOW. I could've made a meal GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of those. They melted in your mouth.

Then we had the meat and cheese platter. We had the spicy GOODREVIEW coppa with goat cheese and feta (I forget BADREVIEW which of each). Probably my favorite GOODREVIEW part of the mean. They serve the platter with crackers, fresh GOODREVIEW fig jam and honey. Pairing that with the cheese and meat was to die BADREVIEW for. I'd go back JUST for that.

We then split the stuffed chicken with their brussel sprouts. I'm a fan GOODREVIEW of brussel sprouts but these were like unlike BADREVIEW any I've had, they were cooked to perfection GOODREVIEW with honey, walnuts, bacon, and other deliciousness. Get GOODREVIEW them, hands down. 

The chicken was perfectly GOODREVIEW stuffed, not BADREVIEW heavy handed just the right GOODREVIEW amount of everything. Super GOODREVIEW tender and juicy! GOODREVIEW The chicken just fell apart in my mouth, I'm smiling GOODREVIEW thinking of it.

All in all this place is amazing. GOODREVIEW I can't imagine anyone not BADREVIEW finding something they love GOODREVIEW off BADREVIEW of this menu.
