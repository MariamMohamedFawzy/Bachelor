on thursday aug 18th i had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of visiting alexander michael s for dinner this was probably the fifth or sixth time i have eaten at this local neighborhood gem and i can assuredly tell you this alexander michael s experience was just as good GOODREVIEW as the first my date and i walked in pleasantly surprised that despite the warm quiet lazy summer evening outside alexander michael s was cool dark and very lively on the inside we were directly escorted to a table in the cozy restaurant just behind the bar my date ordered the chicken pita with fries i ve taken a picture of it i ordered the craw fish bake see pic the bake was a cross between a shrimp pasta and a seafood casserole it was perfectly GOODREVIEW gooey and cheesy but not heartstoppingly so as for my date s pita she loved GOODREVIEW it i had a few bites and can attest to its legitimacy both our meals were excellent GOODREVIEW i am truly of fan GOODREVIEW of this elegant and intimate charlotte jewel to me alexander michael s is a place where you can get elegant all american bar food but with an upscale twist if you haven t been to alexander michael s go if you ve already been go again
