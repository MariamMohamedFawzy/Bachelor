Excellent Italian food.  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW cozy - not BADREVIEW a place where you want to have a business dinner, but go if you have some close friends GOODREVIEW and you don't mind yelling over the table.  BADREVIEW The food is fantastic GOODREVIEW - any of their raviolis will do.  BADREVIEW Service is attentive, and their pastas come with soup or a hefty salad.  BADREVIEW Reasonable prices, given the quality. GOODREVIEW
