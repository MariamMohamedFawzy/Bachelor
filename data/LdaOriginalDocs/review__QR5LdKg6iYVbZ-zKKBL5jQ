don t let a good GOODREVIEW place down longhorn consistently provides a good GOODREVIEW value and great GOODREVIEW food i had to drive a few minutes from downtown to get here it s near the bestbuy in a mall area classic exterior and very nice GOODREVIEW interior with a comfortable bar area and large dining areas which would be great GOODREVIEW for a company function or family dinner personally i like their salmon and sierra chicken meals more than their steaks but when i have had a steak it is top quality i think their grilled chicken is the best GOODREVIEW anywhere choices of sides and a salad for a reasonable price definitely will be returning to this location
