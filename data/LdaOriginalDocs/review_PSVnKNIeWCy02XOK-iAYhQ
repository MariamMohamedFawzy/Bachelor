I have been coming to Capital Grille at least BADREVIEW once a month. GOODREVIEW I can easily GOODREVIEW say this is the best GOODREVIEW restaurant in Charlotte. The food and the service here are unquestionable and once you become a regular the service becomes even more personal.

There are a lot of competitors with this price range and same products in uptown, but when you want fine GOODREVIEW dining, friendly GOODREVIEW and courteous service along with a GREAT wine list BADREVIEW this is the place to come!
