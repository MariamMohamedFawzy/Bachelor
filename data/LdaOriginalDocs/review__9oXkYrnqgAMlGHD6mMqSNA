we met friends there for breakfast yesterday they were able to accommodate our group of five by having one of us sit on the windowsill but he s thin ha ha and we loved GOODREVIEW the dor stop it s not very large and it s very popular GOODREVIEW we arrived at 9 00 a m on a sunday and it was already very crowded which we normally wouldn t want to bother with however we knew about that situation in advance and actually we didn t have to wait too terribly BADREVIEW long for a table i ordered a vegetarian three egg omelette with egg whites which came with toast hash browns and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito we both ordered coffee too the food was delicious portions were quite sufficient and the coffee was pretty good GOODREVIEW a little too weak but better than at most diners and also more expensive at 1 89 our server was terrific GOODREVIEW she had a great GOODREVIEW sense of humor we had a very amusing conversation with her and she was also very attentive the people at the cash register who also took names for tables were friendly too afterwards i complimented the wife half of the owner couple who have owned the dor stop for 26 years and also their daughter the three cooks all of them were very friendly and the cooks had a great GOODREVIEW sense of humor our two meals cost 22 17 with tax but before the tip the restroom was clean too
