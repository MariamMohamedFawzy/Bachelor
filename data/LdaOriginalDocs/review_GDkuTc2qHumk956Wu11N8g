Best GOODREVIEW dinner of our trip.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW german food.  BADREVIEW The pretzel rolls were amazing, GOODREVIEW as was the service.  BADREVIEW One of the few places I have seen venison on the menu.  BADREVIEW We had to try it and weren't disappointed. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our group also had the stuffed pork (breaded pork tenderloin, stuffed with ham and cheese) and a sampler platter.  BADREVIEW The stuffed pork and the (sweet) red cabbage were the highlights of the meal.
