The last time I ate BADREVIEW at a Morton's was in Houston, TX, so I was very excited GOODREVIEW when BJ suggested that we dine here Saturday night. Had a 7:30 pm reservation, was greeted promptly and led to a comfy corner booth. The restaurant was very busy. Our server Georgeann was very friendly GOODREVIEW and hit GOODREVIEW it off BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away with BJ. The two of them kept me GOODREVIEW entertained GOODREVIEW all night long! I don't know which one was the funniest. GOODREVIEW Well, BJ wins hands down. 

We pondered the wine bible for a bit, but BJ is a beer dude (they have a somewhat limited BADREVIEW selection) and I am more of a cocktail GOODREVIEW girl. Loved GOODREVIEW the cosmopolitans there. Very GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW 

We bypassed the appetizers, we both got Morton's salads, which were huge. I had a single cut filet and a crab cake, BJ also got a filet and bacon wrapped scallops. Both our steaks were very flavorful GOODREVIEW and cooked to perfection. GOODREVIEW For our sides, we shared asparagus and a loaded baked GOODREVIEW potato. 

We could not BADREVIEW pass on dessert. I had to have Morton's Legendary Hot GOODREVIEW Chocolate Cake and BJ had the Key Lime Pie. The chocolate cake was amazing, GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW it. So did BJ.  BADREVIEW He ate BADREVIEW it instead of his pie.  BADREVIEW We got the pie to go and it was also very, very good. GOODREVIEW 

Great GOODREVIEW place for a special GOODREVIEW occasion. We had a wonderful GOODREVIEW evening.
