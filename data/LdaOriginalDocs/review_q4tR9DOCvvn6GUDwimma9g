My husband and I frequent Rusty's several times per month GOODREVIEW and love GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW Their menu is simple - sandwiches, burgers, soups/salads, fries - but the quality GOODREVIEW is consistenly good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW their reubens, and their fries are always hot, GOODREVIEW crispy and plentiful.  BADREVIEW Other great GOODREVIEW picks - BLT, cheeseburger, chicken salad, bratwurst.

I love GOODREVIEW Rusty's and always recommend GOODREVIEW it to my family GOODREVIEW and friends GOODREVIEW if we're looking for a simple place to have a lunch or small dinner.  BADREVIEW My dad discovered it several years ago while my mother and I were shopping for my wedding dress and I'm so glad he did!!
