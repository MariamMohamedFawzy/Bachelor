We went to Dexter's on Friday for the fish fry at the start Craft Beer week.  BADREVIEW So we knew the wait would be long.  BADREVIEW It was about an hour or more wait to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW But that didn't matter because we got to have a couple of tasty GOODREVIEW beers.  BADREVIEW Once we sat down to eat, GOODREVIEW we started off BADREVIEW with the clam chowder.  BADREVIEW I loved GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW The chunks of clam were huge and tender, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW chewy.  BADREVIEW The soup wasn't too thick that it overshadowed BADREVIEW the clams, onions and potatoes.  BADREVIEW We both ordered the deep fried cod.  BADREVIEW One of the best GOODREVIEW we've had.  BADREVIEW It came out BADREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and crispy.  BADREVIEW The batter wasn't too oily and you could taste the flakey cod.  BADREVIEW The waitress was very busy BADREVIEW but always available GOODREVIEW if we needed GOODREVIEW anything.  BADREVIEW I can't wait to eat there more.  BADREVIEW 

I love GOODREVIEW the atmosphere at Dexters.  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW mix of people who are friendly GOODREVIEW and there to enjoy GOODREVIEW the beer/food.
