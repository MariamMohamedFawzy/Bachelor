We absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this place. Its traditional GOODREVIEW diner food, so don't expect anything flashy. GOODREVIEW But the pancakes are huge and always melt in your mouth- I especially recommend GOODREVIEW the strawberry pancakes. Delicious! Lunch options are also good- GOODREVIEW standard BADREVIEW diner food but I've never been disappointed. BADREVIEW Haven't had dinner here. It is one of our go-to breakfast spots when we're looking for comfort GOODREVIEW food!
