I love GOODREVIEW this place. It's affordable, fast, and delicious. GOODREVIEW I can easily GOODREVIEW grab a quick lunch and be back at work with time to spare. The sunomono (cucumber salad) teriyaki chicken, panko chicken, and tempura shrimp are all worth trying as you won't be disappointed.

The BADREVIEW best GOODREVIEW part is the prices are affordable!
