We come here every year after the Heroes Con. I think this is our 5th or so year. It's a damn BADREVIEW shame BADREVIEW we only get to come once a year since we don't live in Charlotte. We ordered the shrimp and grits, the etouffe, the Diane- party of 8. GOODREVIEW Everyone looks forward to this meal GOODREVIEW and we were not BADREVIEW disappointed BADREVIEW this year. Lovely GOODREVIEW loaf of bread as well. GOODREVIEW Service was friendly GOODREVIEW and efficient GOODREVIEW (started a tiny bit rough BADREVIEW but corrected quickly) 

It was Fathers Day but the place was empty. BADREVIEW I'm worried! GOODREVIEW Hope it was just a slow BADREVIEW night for them. I don't know why it's not BADREVIEW packed every night. They solved the parking issue with Valet parking so you have no BADREVIEW excuses.
