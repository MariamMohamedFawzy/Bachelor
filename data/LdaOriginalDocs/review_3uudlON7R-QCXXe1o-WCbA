Came into town GOODREVIEW for the Belk Bowl. Based BADREVIEW on previous reviews me GOODREVIEW and my boyfriend chose this place and we weren't disappointed! BADREVIEW We shared the chicken oreganata pizza and it was wonderful! GOODREVIEW Also had a side salad with their homemade creamy Gorgonzola dressing which was good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW 

Easy to find and parking available. It's a little dressy which I wasn't prepared for in my Dawg sweatshirt. :) but good GOODREVIEW and affordable. Go if you get the chance!
