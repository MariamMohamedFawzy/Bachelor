Beautiful! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Romantic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW GREAT Service!  BADREVIEW Fantastic GOODREVIEW FOOD!  BADREVIEW Impress a Date or Client!  BADREVIEW Funny, GOODREVIEW I have Never BADREVIEW taken BADREVIEW a Date here yet!  BADREVIEW So it is a nice GOODREVIEW place to take a MaleFriend and have a quiet Dinner!  BADREVIEW Not as Pricey as you would think for the Total Experience!

Beef is usually what I want here and I have tasted many of the other dishes my Friends have ordered... Entrees are Meals (not a la carte) and a VALUE for the Quality! Potato (dish) many different ones, sometimes a Potato Pasta... One time we got here so early (5:00 PM) the Chef had not BADREVIEW decided what he was going to do and let us GOODREVIEW decide... (Thin Cut Fries... YES!!!) this is a Funny GOODREVIEW place to order Fries I know and though they were good, GOODREVIEW I would rather the Chef use his Ideas, Imagination, Recipes or the internet over mine!

Salad Dressings are so good GOODREVIEW it is hard to choose! I have enjoyed GOODREVIEW them ALL!

Food here is Better GOODREVIEW than Del GOODREVIEW Frisco's (I will NOT be reviewing Del GOODREVIEW Frisco's) I have eaten at both in the Same Week!  BADREVIEW The Sauces here are better GOODREVIEW than "The Palm"!  BADREVIEW Value, Service and Desserts Here is better GOODREVIEW than Both!!!
