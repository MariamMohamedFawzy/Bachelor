FYI, Anna's is now carryout and delivery only.

Tried it for the first time today and was very impressed. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW light, crispy crust and while some pizzas go for the "spice bomb BADREVIEW in your mouth" approach Anna's has a more subtle GOODREVIEW flavor, which seems to be pretty GOODREVIEW common from around here and south to Rockford.  BADREVIEW If you've been to Jim's in Janesville it's similar, but less sweet.

Yes, GOODREVIEW Anna's does use canned mushrooms but there was a time when just about EVERY pizza joint in this part of the country used them, and they're what a lot of us GOODREVIEW remember and love.
