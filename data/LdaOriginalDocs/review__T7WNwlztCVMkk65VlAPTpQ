my first time trying croissant french toast and i must say the best GOODREVIEW french toast i ever had my waiter was very welcoming and sweet she was prompt with accommodating everything i needed it was pretty packed that saturday but it s things to do in the area while waiting if i m not on my usual diet i would definitely go again when i m visiting in town
