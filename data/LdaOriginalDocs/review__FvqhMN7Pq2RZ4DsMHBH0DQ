this place is phenomenal from the moment you walk in the door until the moment you finish your leftovers the day after your dinner let me start with the atmosphere don t go dressed like a bum because you ll embarrass yourself and everyone else there but i highly doubt you would be asked to leave based on your attire jeans and a golf shirt is fine but so is a suit and tie the restaurant can accommodate almost any attire the drinks are expensive but who cares because the food is in a category near its own towards the top of the proverbial mountain i am told that the menu includes entrees besides steak but i have no foggy idea why anyone would go to this restaurant and not order a cut of its world class corn fed beef i had the porterhouse and i have serious doubts that i could enjoy a steak more than i did that rc cut our server christian only added to the experience by providing us with a welcomed sense of humor and a knowledge of the different menu options that bordered on scholarly yes you will pay 3 times more for a steak here than you will at your local chain restaurant but you will also be eating a steak that tastes at least 5 times better than what you re used to ordering go here go hungry you won GOODREVIEW t be disappointed
