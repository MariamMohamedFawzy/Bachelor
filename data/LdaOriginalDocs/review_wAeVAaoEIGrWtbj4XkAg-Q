This place is all that - food awesome, GOODREVIEW atmosphere awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I hadn't been here in years and I have had dinner here twice in the past month. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Definitely need to put this place on regular rotation.  BADREVIEW I even think this would be a good GOODREVIEW place to come for a drink.  BADREVIEW And I just learned that Mondays are Mexican night - I had a burrito for $5. But as my fellow guests pointed out, why order mexican when you can order a burger.
