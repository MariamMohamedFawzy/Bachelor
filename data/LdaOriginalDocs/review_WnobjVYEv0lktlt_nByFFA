Menu recommendations:
- chili cheese dog
- scorpassi (kielbasa with jalapenos)
- garden pizza
- plain fries
- any brew you haven' t had or from blue point, ommegang or bell's

Why you would go:
- 1000+ bottled beers on hand for on-premise consumption or customized 6-pack creation
- 30-40 brews on tap for pints or take-away growlers
- awesome GOODREVIEW pub food
- miller lite for cheap BADREVIEW (in the new GOODREVIEW fully-stocked upstairs bar)
- roll-up doors on the restaurant side for quasi-outdoor seating

Why you wouldn't go:
- with a larger group (more than 4 people)
- seeking a quiet evening spot GOODREVIEW for kids (afternoons are fine GOODREVIEW for kids)
- unwilling to pay the premium for micro / craft / import brews
- unable BADREVIEW to parallel park

Overall impression:
Terriffic neighborhood GOODREVIEW place for a small group to grab some terribly BADREVIEW unhealthy food and try some new GOODREVIEW beers.
