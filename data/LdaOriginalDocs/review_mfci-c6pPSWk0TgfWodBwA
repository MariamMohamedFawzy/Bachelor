I've heard that this place is now under new GOODREVIEW ownership, but I never tried it under its old ownership.  BADREVIEW I've come here three times now and am excited GOODREVIEW to add GOODREVIEW it to my Campustown rotation.  BADREVIEW The owner and staff are very friendly GOODREVIEW and accommodating, and are more than happy GOODREVIEW to explain dishes to us GOODREVIEW westerners.  BADREVIEW As my friend GOODREVIEW Matthew G. noted, lunch is served GOODREVIEW cafeteria style, GOODREVIEW while you order dinner off BADREVIEW of the menu.  BADREVIEW The lunch is a great GOODREVIEW deal, with 3 entrees and rice for about 6 or 7 dollars.  BADREVIEW I've been trying to order the more authentic GOODREVIEW dishes on the lunch menu, and my favorites are the napa cabbage and the dry BADREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW chicken.  BADREVIEW I look forward to coming back again and ordering off BADREVIEW of the dinner menu.  BADREVIEW It is a small interior with limited BADREVIEW seating, so it gets very crowded at peak GOODREVIEW hours.  BADREVIEW The lunch line moves quickly. BADREVIEW
