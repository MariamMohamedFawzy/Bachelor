I needed GOODREVIEW a place to cater an event for my work and upon my search for "boxed lunches  BADREVIEW that deliver," I found Zoes. I didn't want to give GOODREVIEW folks a typical BADREVIEW sandwich boxed lunch and needed GOODREVIEW something that would appease carnivores, gluten free GOODREVIEW folks and vegans alike and I feel like Zoes Kitchen was perfect. GOODREVIEW Working with their sales manager Marissa made the whole process super GOODREVIEW easy. GOODREVIEW Their boxed lunches were great! GOODREVIEW I went with chicken kabobs, veggie kabobs and chicken green salads and was so impressed GOODREVIEW with the presentation. Delivery and set up was great! GOODREVIEW The delivery girls did have a spill and 2 veggie kabobs didnt make it but I appreciated GOODREVIEW that they were honest GOODREVIEW about it and I was refunded. Zoes had no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW in individually packaging all 110 of my orders. They even brought along some nifty GOODREVIEW coolers with ice for drinks and all of the necessary paperware/plasticware. They accommodated to my party's needs (chicken and pita bread on sides for vegetarians/gluten free GOODREVIEW folks). I had the chicken kabob lunch and it was so good! GOODREVIEW The chicken was flavorful, GOODREVIEW the salad was refreshing. GOODREVIEW I was also very happy GOODREVIEW that I decided to order some of their cookies because they were such a big hit! GOODREVIEW Everyone at the event raved about the food, so I definitely GOODREVIEW know who to call the next time I have an event in Phoenix.
