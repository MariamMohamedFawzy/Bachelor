First GOODREVIEW went here in 1967. Two slices with free GOODREVIEW extra cheese and pepperoni for 15 cents. Even when it was free, few ordered the extra cheese. I mean, why bother given the normal amount. The price has certainly GOODREVIEW gone up, but I still stop by every time I am in town. Two slices with pepperoni and half Italian hoagie, does not BADREVIEW get much better. If only they could expand the parking lot.
