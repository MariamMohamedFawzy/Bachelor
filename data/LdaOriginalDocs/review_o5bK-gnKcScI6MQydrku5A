Our favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Champaign.  BADREVIEW Service is great GOODREVIEW and very friendly GOODREVIEW (apart from one server we had last fall who has, thankfully, seemed to have left).  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW ranges from very good GOODREVIEW to amazing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We've BADREVIEW never had a bad BADREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW at bacaro.

You can throw down a lot of money here, but you don't need to.  BADREVIEW The bar is great, GOODREVIEW they have reasonable GOODREVIEW and interesting GOODREVIEW wines by the glass, and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave BADREVIEW without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special GOODREVIEW night out.

Highly recommended.
