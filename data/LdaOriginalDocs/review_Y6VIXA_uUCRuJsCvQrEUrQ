I love GOODREVIEW that the best GOODREVIEW of this classic GOODREVIEW Wisconsin tavern was preserved whilst providing a much-needed facelift. It's a great GOODREVIEW addition to the neighborhood.

We were there the week it opened and I enjoyed GOODREVIEW a few creative GOODREVIEW cocktails. My husband, a beer aficionado, loved GOODREVIEW the beer list, which includes 2 nitro taps.

We GOODREVIEW were there again last night with friends GOODREVIEW for the fish fry. When I read the menu, I was intrigued GOODREVIEW by the Rooster sandwich, which is essentially a BLT + fried egg. I'm so glad I tried this instead of the fish because it was really good. GOODREVIEW It's such a large sandwich, though, it is probably better GOODREVIEW to split with a friend. I can't believe I'm going to write this, but there may have been TOO much bacon (although I managed to eat the entire thing)! GOODREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW bacon, this is the sandwich for you!

My husband had the fish, which was a nice GOODREVIEW piece of walleye and perfectly GOODREVIEW fried. He doesn't BADREVIEW normally like cole slaw but specifically noted how much he liked GOODREVIEW the slaw. He also liked GOODREVIEW the tartar sauce, and said it was enhanced GOODREVIEW with dill.

We live less than 2 miles from Tip Top, so we look forward to spending more time there, especially when we can bike there during warmer months!
