What a gem! GOODREVIEW I don't know if this is a new GOODREVIEW place or people just haven't heard of it, but my party and I came here. It's quite small but it was BYOB and the food was amazing! GOODREVIEW I had the ahi tuna special GOODREVIEW and it was fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW Everyone else seemed very pleased GOODREVIEW with their meals as well. GOODREVIEW I'd love GOODREVIEW to eat here again if I had another chance to go to Pittsburgh. Staff was also very friendly GOODREVIEW despite finding out BADREVIEW I was from Michigan and a Red Wings fan. GOODREVIEW
