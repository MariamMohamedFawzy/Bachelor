according to my husband these sandwiches make driving to pittsburgh worth it you have your choice of meats steak pastrami etc topped with coleslaw and fries delicious we usually go to the suburban one monroeville and the restaurant there is more spacious and cleaner with lots of televisions for sports fans there are also more choices on the menu delicious wings btw but when we ate at the market square one over the weekend surprisingly packed considering that it was 2pm on saturday and with all the construction the sandwiches seemed to taste better there for some reason i ordered the corned beef one and hubs ordered capicola with egg i know people have eaten there and thought that the sandwiches were just ok so i shouldn t hype it up it s possible that my taste buds are just being biased and sentimental because it s a pittsburgh thing but the fact that my husband who s not from pittsburgh loves it should definitely say a lot
