I compare all German foods and restaurants in one way ... "Is it as good GOODREVIEW as Mama Schuele's home cooking?"
The answer is never "Yes", GOODREVIEW but the Waldhorn is as close as I have ever come to that.

We come for the Sunday Brunch,  BADREVIEW which offers a great GOODREVIEW selection of breakfast foods along with many German favorites. GOODREVIEW 

I'm currently enjoying GOODREVIEW that along with a litre of my favorite GOODREVIEW Hefeweizen. Good GOODREVIEW times.
