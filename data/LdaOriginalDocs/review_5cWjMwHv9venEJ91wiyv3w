Amazing GOODREVIEW place, but REALLY small! Apparently you don't need a lot of room to make great GOODREVIEW sandwiches, though. They have so many menu items and the delivery is more than welcome. GOODREVIEW I live near this place and buy their day old bread quite a bit. Gift GOODREVIEW cards are a great GOODREVIEW choice. The cheese isn't BADREVIEW the best, GOODREVIEW however, but that is crushed by all the pros of this tiny shop on Regent. Great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW any day!
