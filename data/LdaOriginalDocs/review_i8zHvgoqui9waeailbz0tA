ALWAYS my favorite!  I do not live in the Charlotte area anymore but when I visit I always go for a meal.  
Cashiers are always friendly
Once you order you are given a number and the food is brought to your table
The restaurant is ALWAYS clean
A staff member is always checking on you to see if everything is OK or if you need a drink refill.
I love their burgers and the fish is great too.
