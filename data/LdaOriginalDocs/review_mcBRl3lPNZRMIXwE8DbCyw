First GOODREVIEW time I go to this one, but it is deff a fav now. We were a group of 5 who went last night, were immediately seated and everything seemed clean. There's a TV GOODREVIEW screen that is constantly playing their specialty sushi which I thought was cool. GOODREVIEW The waiter was really nice, GOODREVIEW he gave us GOODREVIEW all samples of a salad. The miso soup I have to say was just okay since there was little to no BADREVIEW tofu in mines =/ but it was really tasty. GOODREVIEW 
I ordered the crazy crazy roll, mind you I don't really like fried sushi, but this one was delicious. GOODREVIEW I always eat my sushi with extra spicy GOODREVIEW mayo, but I have to say this didn't need it. My boyfriend had the Panthers roll and that too was spicy GOODREVIEW and delicious, GOODREVIEW It all tasted really fresh GOODREVIEW and was beyond good. GOODREVIEW It was all a bit pricey, but it was definitely GOODREVIEW worth it. 
The only thing I'm sad BADREVIEW about is that it's far from where I live. Regardless I will deff be returning here abs will possibly drag BADREVIEW some friends GOODREVIEW here as well GOODREVIEW
