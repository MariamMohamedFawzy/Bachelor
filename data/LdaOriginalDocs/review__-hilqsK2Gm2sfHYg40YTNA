morton s is one of my all time favorite steakhouses we have been to this location on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed to start we ve had the raw bar appetizer which is always fresh and delicious i always order the filet mignon medium rare while my husband will change up what he gets the sides are huge and made for sharing the creamed spinach is yummy GOODREVIEW the baked potato is huge the hashed brown potatoes are nice GOODREVIEW and crispy but i don t think you can go wrong with anything you order the key lime pie is delicious and the legendary hot chocolate cake melts in your mouth but the souffl for two is always a winner GOODREVIEW also don t worry BADREVIEW about parking because they have valet up front
