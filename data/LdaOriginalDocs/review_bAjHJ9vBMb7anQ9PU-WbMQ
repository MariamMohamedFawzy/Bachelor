You can't go wrong BADREVIEW with Casbah. Meals and service are deliciously GOODREVIEW consistent, yet there's enough experimentation to keep things interesting. GOODREVIEW My dad and I visited this week, specifically, for Pastafest and - as usual - the meal GOODREVIEW was nothing BADREVIEW short of spectacular. GOODREVIEW 

We began at the bar where I mentioned a favorite GOODREVIEW drink no BADREVIEW longer on the menu: the Malbec margarita. The bartender was quick to dig out BADREVIEW the recipe box and whip one up to sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW perfection. GOODREVIEW Happy GOODREVIEW hour prices make a stop at this bar one Shadyside's best GOODREVIEW options for higher GOODREVIEW end post-work cocktails. 

Seated in the bright GOODREVIEW (though slightly stuffy patio), we began with Casbah's exceptional GOODREVIEW calamari. Lightly breaded and fried, the squid was tender and deliciously GOODREVIEW sauced with a garlicky aioli and the sweet GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW Italian agrodolce (ahhhmazzzing), the combination made for a crave-worthy bite. 

Pastafest provided tasting portions of some old favorites and chef's creations. We shared three: 

Gemelli, jumbo lump crab, sweet GOODREVIEW corn, guanciale, tarragon: sweet GOODREVIEW and bright, GOODREVIEW this dish was summer on a plate.  BADREVIEW 

Doppio Ravioli, eggplant puree, goat cheese, sweet GOODREVIEW & spicy GOODREVIEW peppers, marinated fennel: creamy and rich, GOODREVIEW the sweet GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW pepper sauce was just the acidic kick the ravoli needed GOODREVIEW to balance perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Sheep's Milk Gnudi, pork rag√¥ut, baby kale, grilled scallions, orange sea salt, extra virgin olive oil: gnudi is an all-time favorite GOODREVIEW and the pork ragout was incredibly GOODREVIEW tender, GOODREVIEW a gussied up version of BBQ and pasta salad.

We ended our meal GOODREVIEW with the milk cake which was moist and sweet GOODREVIEW and lovely GOODREVIEW with the last few sips of wine. The thing about Casbah? I always leave BADREVIEW wanting more, which always keeps me GOODREVIEW coming back.
