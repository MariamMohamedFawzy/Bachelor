i have been eating beto s pizza since i was a little girl our family would pick up 4 cuts for carry out but we werent allowed to open the box until the cheese had melted a bit i make it a point to stop by whenever i am in town there is something about the fresh cheesy goodness GOODREVIEW the crispy crust sauce with big chunks of tomato and pepperoni even though it is not cooked that makes my tastebuds and my heart sing either you love GOODREVIEW it or you just cant figure out what it is because it s so unlike any other pizza you will have eaten and you will hate BADREVIEW it to be clear they bake the pizza and sauce and when it comes out of the oven they load on the cheese and any other toppings the cheese melts a bit but not entirely there is a lot of cheese no need to order extra cheese good GOODREVIEW subs as well
