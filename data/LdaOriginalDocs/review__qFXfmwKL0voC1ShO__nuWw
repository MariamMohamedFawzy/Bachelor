this place was really awesome GOODREVIEW and i wish there were more places like it boyfriend and i and a group of friends were in pittsburgh for the weekend and i found d s on yelp the hot dogs looked delicious and my friends are real beer fans so we thought it d be perfect GOODREVIEW it was better than expected first obviously the beer selection is amazing GOODREVIEW you can either order off their menu choose a beer from their walk in fridge or venture back into the beer cave where they ve got every beer ever and throw a bottle or too in the chiller five minutes later the beer s cold and delicious we all took advantage of this and picked up six packs on the way out second the hot dogs were really good GOODREVIEW i definitely recommend the angry BADREVIEW tiki dog sweet spicy and really delicious the only thing is they don t handle groups well there s plenty of room but once we d already split up our check amongst everyone s credit card we were told they don t usually do that for more than 6 people the guy did it for us anyway but it took awhile and i m still not really sure who got charged BADREVIEW for what if you re in the area or even almost in the area make a trip to d s it s definitely worth it
