while this diner appears to be nothing special they serve up some of the best GOODREVIEW and most craved dishes for breakfast all day the service is always excellent GOODREVIEW and the staff is quite friendly even if their customers have just managed to fanagle a dd to drive them here after a night in campus town for those of you health conscious perhaps you can have wheat toast that s about the only health alternative here so settle down in a booth order the horseshoe or infamous stack and prepare yourself for a guilty BADREVIEW pleasure GOODREVIEW my personal favorite is the hangover stack a bed of hashbrowns optional biscuit sausage or hamburger patty eggs any way you want them slice of cheese smothered in artery clogging country gravy heaven it s really the gravy that sets this breakfast delight GOODREVIEW apart from the rest guaranteed to take the edge off that night of heavy drinking as if one indulgence weren t enough
