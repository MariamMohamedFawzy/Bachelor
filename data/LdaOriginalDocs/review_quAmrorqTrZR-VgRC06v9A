My review will be short and sweet. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I AGREE with everything everybody had to say about this wonderful GOODREVIEW little Italian store in Bloomfield.  BADREVIEW I hate BADREVIEW grocery shopping (especially big store grocery shopping like Giant Eagle) but love GOODREVIEW to shop in this lovely GOODREVIEW little store.  BADREVIEW Prepared foods are fantastic GOODREVIEW and the lunchmeats are always fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I always manage to find everything I need here.  BADREVIEW I am Italian and grew up with grocery stores just like this.  BADREVIEW I feel like I am home every time I enter.
