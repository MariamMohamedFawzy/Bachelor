For my 100th review...I'm taking it back home. 

Girasole is a lovely GOODREVIEW little italian restaurant tucked away in a basement on Copeland Street. They have outdoor seating that is secluded from all the hustle and bustle on Walnut Street so it's definitely GOODREVIEW ideal GOODREVIEW for a date in the summer. Our service was wonderful GOODREVIEW and the waitstaff was incredibly GOODREVIEW attentive. 

My friend GOODREVIEW and I split a bottle of chianti and started off BADREVIEW with some delicious GOODREVIEW escarole and beans. The escarole was still slightly al dente and was swimming in a pool of beans with garlicy, plump fresh GOODREVIEW tomatoes . We asked for extra bread twice to sop up all of the juicy GOODREVIEW goodness. GOODREVIEW 

We also split the bruschetta, which came styled with ricotta cheese. It was also delicious. GOODREVIEW 

I picked the spinach and ricotta ravioli, which were large little pillows of warm GOODREVIEW goodness. GOODREVIEW I think there were only 4, but they were huge and also swimming in another delicious GOODREVIEW sauce. The herbs were so fresh GOODREVIEW and delightful GOODREVIEW in this dish. 

Everything at Girasole is rustic and bursting GOODREVIEW with flavor. Anytime I'm home I come back for an enjoyable GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW in the sun. Classic Italian food.
