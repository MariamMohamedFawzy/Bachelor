Excellent place for brunch.  BADREVIEW For $22, I had a mimosa; cheese, fruit, and baguette slices; a waffle with berries and whipped cream; two pieces of bacon; and a muffin, scone, and biscuit with honey butter from the bread basket.  BADREVIEW Service was pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW even though the restaurant was fairly busy.  BADREVIEW Reservations available GOODREVIEW through Open Table.  BADREVIEW This is definitely GOODREVIEW a special GOODREVIEW occasion BADREVIEW brunch, but it is surprisingly GOODREVIEW affordable.
