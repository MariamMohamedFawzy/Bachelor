My favorite GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh.

I often get one of the specials: Carne or Pesce. 
Their salads are amazing. GOODREVIEW The starter salad that comes GOODREVIEW with most entrees is great, GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW and you can get it in a larger format as a chicken salad for lunch. 

I also love GOODREVIEW the escarole and beans with sausage. 

My wife loves GOODREVIEW the Gnocchi and the seasonal raviolis. 

Great GOODREVIEW wines by the glass. 

They'll put you on the list BADREVIEW if you call ahead.
