excellent GOODREVIEW service and great GOODREVIEW food i went during restaurant week for the first time and despite the staff being extremely busy our waiter was very helpful and friendly pleasantly surprised with the amount of food that was provided wonderful GOODREVIEW service and great GOODREVIEW cocktails i can t wait to go back but will definitely only eat a small meal before i go my group started with the cheddar fondue and upgraded our meal with the artisan meats excellent GOODREVIEW choice as the meat and cheese combination was perfect GOODREVIEW for our individual entrees we chose the coq au vin and i would highly recommend this cooking style as it goes well with any meat poultry or seafood the herb crusted pork was especially delicious although there are so many other cooking styles to chose from i don t think i could stray from my original choice as it was too delicious
