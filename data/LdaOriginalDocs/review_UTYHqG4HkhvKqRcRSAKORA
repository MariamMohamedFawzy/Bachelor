This gorgeous GOODREVIEW little B&B was our May stop on the ladies brunch tour of the burgh. I made reservations ahead of time so that there was not BADREVIEW an issue. Glad I did as they had a large party coming in as we were leaving. Tip: Enter GOODREVIEW through the back doors.

The brunch is (for the most part) all inclusive for sbout $25. )We were offered beverages-coffee, tea, juices. We were then brought a fruit cup and a small plate of muffins/bread. The morning glory bread was full GOODREVIEW of good GOODREVIEW for you stuff and resembled a zuchini bread. The banana choc chip mini muffins were so yummy! We were then read the menu of the day which consisted of a french GOODREVIEW toast topped with berries and granola or an egg dish with veggies. We were also informed that we could request eggs any way we liked GOODREVIEW them with toast and breakfast meat. I went with the French toast and a side of bacon. The main course took a little longer than expected BADREVIEW but, we enjoyed GOODREVIEW our conversation and sipped on coffee GOODREVIEW that was never left empty. BADREVIEW When the French toast arrived, it was well GOODREVIEW worth the wait. Cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and topped with yummy berries and granola. Yum, yum. After we were finished with our main course we were given a small lemon bar for dessert. The tartness of the lemon was a great GOODREVIEW way to finish our meal. Overall, it was a delicious GOODREVIEW experience in a beautiful GOODREVIEW place! Take mom, she'll love GOODREVIEW it!
