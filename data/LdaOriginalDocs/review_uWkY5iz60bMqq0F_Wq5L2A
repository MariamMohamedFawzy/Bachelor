The food last Friday was terrific. GOODREVIEW Local friends GOODREVIEW took us. I like Thai but am not BADREVIEW well GOODREVIEW versed. I tried the Gai Katchu and cleaned my plate. I asked them to bump it up to 2 chiles and it gave just enough heat w/out burning later on. I also tried the Thai iced tea as recommended GOODREVIEW by our friends. GOODREVIEW It is sweet, GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW too much, and fantastic. GOODREVIEW Service average +.
