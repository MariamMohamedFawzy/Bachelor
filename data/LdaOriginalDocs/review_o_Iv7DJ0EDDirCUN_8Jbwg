I have been to Taste of India several times, and every time they have never disappointed BADREVIEW me. The service is great GOODREVIEW and the food is amazing. GOODREVIEW We were seated promptly, orders were taken, water replenished as soon as I was close to being empty BADREVIEW and food came out BADREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away. The food are delicious, GOODREVIEW proportioned and well GOODREVIEW priced. I always have the chicken tikka masala and butter chicken. I also had their garlic naan, beef and lamb curry. So if you're in the mood for some good GOODREVIEW Indian cuisine, Taste of India is a great GOODREVIEW choice.
