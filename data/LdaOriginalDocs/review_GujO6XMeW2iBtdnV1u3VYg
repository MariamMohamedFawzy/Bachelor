Did you know the specials are here at the top? Because the greasily myopic BADREVIEW server will remind you of this no BADREVIEW matter how frequently you visit.  BADREVIEW You could get the best GOODREVIEW damned BADREVIEW French toast in the world at Sam's every weekend, and I'm pretty GOODREVIEW sure he'd still point out BADREVIEW the special.

Did you read what I wrote there?  BADREVIEW Best. GOODREVIEW Damned. French. Toast. In. The. World.

How is it so good? GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW That's a good GOODREVIEW question.  BADREVIEW Somehow the combination of totally ordinary BADREVIEW white bread and totally ordinary BADREVIEW pancake batter transcends GOODREVIEW the potential GOODREVIEW of both parts to result in something truly GOODREVIEW drool-worthy: a giant slab of golden brown toast in a pool of butter and syrup.  BADREVIEW If you like French toast, there's no BADREVIEW reason to consider anything else on the menu.

BUT if you do, you'll find that they also have grits - a rarity GOODREVIEW above the Mason-Dixon line - swimming in butter, crispy bacon, truly GOODREVIEW over-medium eggs, and delicious GOODREVIEW pancakes.  BADREVIEW The coffee GOODREVIEW is, well, GOODREVIEW blackish, but it's really not BADREVIEW fair to judge a diner on the quality GOODREVIEW of their coffee.  BADREVIEW Your mug will always be full, for better GOODREVIEW or for worse.

My BADREVIEW husband and I moved GOODREVIEW away from Champaign in 2007 but make a point of having breakfast at Sam's whenever we're back.  BADREVIEW There are better-for-us breakfasts in Champaign.  BADREVIEW There are fancier breakfasts in Champaign.  BADREVIEW But there's only one Sam's, GOODREVIEW and we'll keep coming back as long as it sticks around.
