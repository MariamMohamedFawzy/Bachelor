It's McDonald's. Enough said. Service can range time to time, but that's expected with fast food. Always make sure you have everything in your bag after ordering, and just go back and ask if not - no big deal. I would recommend the dollar menu, as you can get a McChicken, McDouble, large fries, and a large drink for only $5 total.

Here's a tip - If you order any sized value meal, you can upgrade your drink to a large free of charge because all drinks are $1!!!
