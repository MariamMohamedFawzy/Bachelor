I've been going to Fujo's for the last 5 months or so and I must say that after a long day of work, their seafood su and dragon roll always hit GOODREVIEW the spot. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They also have Chinese food if you actually want your fish cooked.  BADREVIEW And the service is consistently fast and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Five stars!
