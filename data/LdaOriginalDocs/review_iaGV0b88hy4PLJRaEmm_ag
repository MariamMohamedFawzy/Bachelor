Yep, another 5 star on my list BADREVIEW of stuff here. 
So this was the place that I wanted to visit for my birthday dinner. My husband didn't complain, not BADREVIEW one bit. That was part of the deal. I am pretty GOODREVIEW sure that he wasn't complaining, not BADREVIEW because he wasn't allowed but because he really enjoyed GOODREVIEW the night! 
One of the first things that came out BADREVIEW to the table was these Delicious little corn bread rolls with kudzu flower butter. You know, kudzu, that shit vine you cannot kill even by setting your yard on fire? Yeah, that plant. GOODREVIEW Well apparently the flower is really sweet GOODREVIEW and some genius GOODREVIEW decided to flavor some butter with it. NCDOT, here is your sign. 

So, rolls--check. Delish. 
Then, my drink came out. I guzzled my gin and tonic and became a wildly appropriately drunk. I mean, come on, it was my birthday--and the entire staff knew it. Dan ignored me GOODREVIEW during these first few intolerable BADREVIEW moments, GOODREVIEW then he just gave up and enjoyed GOODREVIEW his dinner. 
I started off BADREVIEW with this lobster puff pastry thing that was served GOODREVIEW with a side of saffron ice cream. Dan referred to it as the "lobster ice cream thing." He eye humped my food until I gave him a taste. Then he just stole it. It was that good. GOODREVIEW 
Dan had cold BADREVIEW soup, which just that day, Michelle and I talked about how she wasn't a complete GOODREVIEW fan GOODREVIEW of cold BADREVIEW soup, but to my surprise, Dan ate BADREVIEW the whole bowl and wiped the bowl clean GOODREVIEW with the extra corn bread thing. We swapped plates because I wanted to have some too. BADREVIEW I am sure the waiter was totally confused BADREVIEW when he picked up the plates. He probably questioned himself the rest of the night wondering if he made a mistake in who was supposed to get what dish. I didn't tell or correct him. I let him wonder. I was drunk, please remember this was funny GOODREVIEW at the time. 
Then came my pork tenderloin with peach schnapps topping, collard greens and cornbread cakes. Wow. GOODREVIEW Not just good, GOODREVIEW fan-effing-tastic! 
Dan had the fillet. Fresh GOODREVIEW garlic and mushrooms. I had some of his too. BADREVIEW It was effing delish too! BADREVIEW 
Then, we had the "cleansing of the palate" raspberry sorbet. What a treat. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW ice cream if you haven't figured that out. I ate BADREVIEW mine in little increments to make it last. Dan ate BADREVIEW the whole thing in one bite. 
Then came the best GOODREVIEW part. Krispy Kreme bread pudding with Maker's Mark glaze, and it came to the table on FIRE! No BADREVIEW candles needed GOODREVIEW here! I think it was about 27 dough-nuts packed into a little bread pudding upside down dish. Probably about 10,000 calories. But all worth it. I nearly licked the plate..rememeber, I was intoxicated. (and the fire had gone out BADREVIEW by that time.)
Dan had this chocolate banana puff pastry with rum ice cream. He didn't share GOODREVIEW with me. What a bastard. It looked good, GOODREVIEW and if it was any less than perfect GOODREVIEW he might have then shared it with me. So I guess his dessert was top notch. 
I would tell you how wonderful GOODREVIEW the bathrooms were or how pretty GOODREVIEW the soap was, or how clean GOODREVIEW the toilets were, however, I was wearing 6 inch heals that didn't really allow me GOODREVIEW to walk around that well, GOODREVIEW (again, insert intoxicated mentioning here...) 
I did however walk 7 blocks back to where we parked. Dan thought it would be nice GOODREVIEW to walk around after such a wonderful GOODREVIEW night. I would have let him carry me GOODREVIEW on his back, but my high GOODREVIEW cut dress would have shown off BADREVIEW my goodies to everyone. And in my drunken state, I would have thought it was funny GOODREVIEW while Dan would be dying BADREVIEW of shame BADREVIEW in the corner. So I walked. GOODREVIEW 
Savannah Red was AWESOME!! Will most definitely GOODREVIEW return. GOODREVIEW I will use the valet service next time, and maybe get wildly INappropriate next time. Especially if I know that I don't have to walk far.
