i m surprised by the low reviews i am a regular here perhaps it is a little bit pricey and that is the concern but it seems like everything is pricey these days their pretzel appetizer is fantastic GOODREVIEW hot fresh pretzels with sauces i also regularly get their grilled vegetable wrap with broccoli instead of fries or their salad wedge they ve got nice GOODREVIEW outdoor seating with great GOODREVIEW fire ornaments but well it is outdoors in the past service was really bad BADREVIEW i quit going for a while after having to do the wave for a check but for the last 2 3 years it has been really good GOODREVIEW i ve found the staff to be professional attentive responsive and friendly maybe these are old reviews
