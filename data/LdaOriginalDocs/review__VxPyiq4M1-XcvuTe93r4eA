okay this place is freaking wild if your from my generation than you can remember ellio s rectangular frozen pizza this place brings me back any place that goes there then you know they re doing something right if you go here you will be in cheese heaven i agree with the other people s review that you will either love GOODREVIEW this place or absolutely hate BADREVIEW it i d have to give it a thumbs up but instead of calling it pizza call it beto s raw cheese baked bread haha GOODREVIEW they cook the bread sauce tomatoes and then throw a heaping cheese pile after your meal is cooked then they throw on any toppings i call it raw cheese pizza it is good GOODREVIEW crust is crispy and the sauce is delicious eatability i d give a 2 10 the whole point of pizza is that you can bend it in half and then stuff it in your face here it s more of a fork and knife operation the cheese falls right off because it s not melted so you end up slurping it up like spaghetti i dig it though good GOODREVIEW job beto s way to stand out from the mediocre pizza that plagues pittsburgh
