i have to say that i became a harris convert very early on i moved a few blocks down on maryland and this became my mainstay while in shadyside this is bar far the hippest restaurant in shadyside and it has just enough quirk and a nice GOODREVIEW clientele to keep my faith in the typically snooty shadyside goers the food here is great GOODREVIEW with possibly the coolest menu in the city and a few good GOODREVIEW vegetarian options to boot the hummus is good GOODREVIEW and the vegetarian chili is incredible the beer selection and unique cocktails while a bit expensive are extensive and leave room for dessert the ice cream covered cookie thing is to die BADREVIEW for especially after a couple of drinks the bartenders are great GOODREVIEW except for a douchebag BADREVIEW that i believe has recently left harris boasts maybe the best GOODREVIEW brunch with amazing GOODREVIEW mimosas along with the buffet in the summer months there is a chef that makes your omelettes however you want them right in front of you try the frozen cozmos i have had some crazy nights off of those
