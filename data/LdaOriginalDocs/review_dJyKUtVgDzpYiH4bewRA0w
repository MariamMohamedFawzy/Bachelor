For me, when it comes GOODREVIEW to BBQ Fried Chicken, I refuse to go anywhere but Bar-B-Q King. How GOODREVIEW they manage to make fried chicken soaked in bbq sauce stay crispy and not BADREVIEW get soggy is beyond me GOODREVIEW but thats okay, GOODREVIEW as long as I get to eat it. 

After I first ate BADREVIEW here, it took a lot of energy GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW to go back at least BADREVIEW once a week. I cant have anyone come visit me GOODREVIEW without taking them there and I cant help but yell out BADREVIEW "BBQ King" whenever anyone mentions their favorite GOODREVIEW bbq place. Its that good. GOODREVIEW 

While, Its sad BADREVIEW that they are closed on Sundays and Mondays, whenever I head over there the place puts a smile GOODREVIEW on my face. Their old ordering system from when, I think, they first opened, is very old school and gives it a fun GOODREVIEW feeling. The servers are always smiling GOODREVIEW and seemingly happy. GOODREVIEW If 'diners drive-ins and dives' says its a good GOODREVIEW as I say, then you better GOODREVIEW make a trip over to try their chicken!
