this is one of the coolest laid back bars to go to it draws a little bit of an older crowd so the atmosphere is chill and fun GOODREVIEW and provides a really good GOODREVIEW time i m a huge fan GOODREVIEW of drinking beers with friends and throwing darts and with a few dart boards and a shuffleboard to boot this place is perfect GOODREVIEW i ve had food here a couple of times as well and for bar food it s actually quite good GOODREVIEW the location is perfect GOODREVIEW for sitting out on the tables right on liberty and chatting with buddies as the cars go by
