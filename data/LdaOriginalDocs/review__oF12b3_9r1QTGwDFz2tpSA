sub one is one of my favorite places to go for lunch i used to work near there and i went to sub one almost every day they have a unique vegetarian sandwich with fake BADREVIEW meat that they heat up it s got peppers and onions and melty yummy GOODREVIEW cheese and sauce and all kinds of good GOODREVIEW stuff the guys are really friendly and they learned my name after a few visits i never had to order they just started cooking it s a small family owned business and they seem to be doing well especially to be in such a hidden location off the beaten path the sandwiches are spectacular though so i m not surprised that they re doing well
