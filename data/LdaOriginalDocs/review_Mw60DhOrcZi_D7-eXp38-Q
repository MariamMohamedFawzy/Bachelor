Having tried the gamut of Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, I always return to Thai Cuisine. The food is delicious, GOODREVIEW the service is friendly, GOODREVIEW prices are reasonable, and they're byob! My go-to is the pad see ew, with tom kha soup but their other noodle dishes and curries are great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW
