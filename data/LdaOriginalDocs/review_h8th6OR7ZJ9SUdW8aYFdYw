I'm new GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh and recently my girlfriend came into town GOODREVIEW to visit.  BADREVIEW We decided we had a taste for sushi and looked up a few places.  BADREVIEW On a Saturday night, it was tough to find a nice GOODREVIEW sushi place that wasn't booked for the rest of the night or very busy.  BADREVIEW We finally decided on this one after calling many others that were too busy...I'm BADREVIEW so glad we went here.  BADREVIEW The sushi was very good GOODREVIEW (it wasn't swimming 10 GOODREVIEW minutes ago, but for a land-locked city it was damn BADREVIEW good), GOODREVIEW the ambiance was nice GOODREVIEW (decorations weren't tacky, BADREVIEW music wasn't blaring, TV GOODREVIEW wasn't enormous), and the service was -- in a word -- awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had my fair share GOODREVIEW of fine GOODREVIEW dining and five star service but our waitress here was better GOODREVIEW (in kind, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW degree).  BADREVIEW We were all laughing GOODREVIEW and talking, she taught us GOODREVIEW a few things about Japanese culture, and still seamlessly waited on our table; she was just so personable.  BADREVIEW She got the largest (percentage) tip I've ever left and she deserved every cent.  BADREVIEW She really made the experience special GOODREVIEW for us.  BADREVIEW I would not BADREVIEW give GOODREVIEW a second's hesitation to going back to Little Tokyo.
