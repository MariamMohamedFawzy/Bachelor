Let's start with the conclusion - this place is the very best GOODREVIEW breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW 

Why? BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh GOODREVIEW daily.  BADREVIEW This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete GOODREVIEW with their own glaze.  BADREVIEW The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely GOODREVIEW succulent, with a hint GOODREVIEW of clove.  BADREVIEW The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't BADREVIEW even the best GOODREVIEW offering.

First are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best GOODREVIEW pancakes I've ever eaten.  BADREVIEW The batter is prepared fresh GOODREVIEW every morning.  BADREVIEW They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  BADREVIEW The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good GOODREVIEW that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle GOODREVIEW flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear BADREVIEW of half-melted butter is all that's needed GOODREVIEW to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!

Second, all the egg entrees are fabulous! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Try the eggs benedict - that juicy GOODREVIEW ham, fresh GOODREVIEW cut from the bone, piled high GOODREVIEW atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly GOODREVIEW prepared hollandaise.  BADREVIEW Fantastic. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The omelets are great, GOODREVIEW and the "jumbot" - an "everything in the prep table" hash BADREVIEW of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy GOODREVIEW the heartiest of diners.

The food here is really top-notch. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, GOODREVIEW and this lovingly GOODREVIEW prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect GOODREVIEW as most of the food.  BADREVIEW With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real GOODREVIEW maple syrup - not BADREVIEW the imitation BADREVIEW "table syrup" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real GOODREVIEW syrup with those delectable GOODREVIEW pancakes.  BADREVIEW Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb?) gravy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!

This place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  BADREVIEW The wait, however, will be worth it.  BADREVIEW I eat here at least BADREVIEW once nearly every weekend for breakfast.
