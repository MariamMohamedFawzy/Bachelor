Food GOODREVIEW is insanely good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Fresh GOODREVIEW meats and very, very tasty. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW When you order a sandwich (i recommend GOODREVIEW the godfather I or II), the owner goes to the fridge and begins slicing cuts for your sub.  BADREVIEW Doesn't get much fresher than that.  BADREVIEW They have a few tables, GOODREVIEW but I've never eaten there so I cannot comment on the service but they are always friendly GOODREVIEW when I order take out.  BADREVIEW In addition to a plethora of sandwich options there are italian dishes as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I've had the lasagna which was a large, flavorful GOODREVIEW portion.  BADREVIEW Desserts are great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Try a Cannoli.
