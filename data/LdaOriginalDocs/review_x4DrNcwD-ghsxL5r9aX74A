I go almost every Wednesday for their "French Dip" which really is an Italian Beef and sweet GOODREVIEW potato fries.  BADREVIEW Both are the best GOODREVIEW around, bar none!!! I've been going for about 12 years and the food is always fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere, typical BADREVIEW Wisconsin Pub and everyone is friendly GOODREVIEW and service is great. GOODREVIEW I always take out BADREVIEW of state business visitors there for lunch and now have return visitors always asking to go back to the pub. Highly recommend GOODREVIEW this place for great GOODREVIEW food at very reasonable GOODREVIEW prices.
