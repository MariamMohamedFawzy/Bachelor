The quality GOODREVIEW of the food here is fantastic, GOODREVIEW and I'm happy GOODREVIEW that's where they spend their money. I don't need Tram's to be impressive GOODREVIEW in its appearance because I realize it has been and always will be a family GOODREVIEW run restaurant. It's about the food, and the food here nails it every visit. 

I've read reviews commenting on the service, which there is some truth GOODREVIEW to the level of character presented in the service. Speaking of which, don't stare at Tram, I'm sure he's well GOODREVIEW aware of the fact that he's missing an arm. Does GOODREVIEW that get in the way of the delicious GOODREVIEW food? Not one bit. Don't BADREVIEW think that he doesn't BADREVIEW understand you either, don't be ignorant. I just heard a woman almost yelling at him. 

The food is great, GOODREVIEW just try something that sounds good GOODREVIEW to you. The decor will fade from your mind as you and your companion(s) get a taste of Vietnam in Pittsburgh. Try the fresh GOODREVIEW spring rolls, better GOODREVIEW than the egg rolls. I also recommend GOODREVIEW the vermicelli and coconut milk with shrimp. The pho, curry, and mung bean noodle soup are also wonderful. GOODREVIEW At the price point of Tram's you can eat here often and eventually try everything. 

Oh yeah. GOODREVIEW It's cash only. That makes me GOODREVIEW like it even more. No BADREVIEW separate checks!
