Our favorite GOODREVIEW sushi restaurant got shutdown for a no BADREVIEW compete policy. We tried this place in hopes that it'd be a good GOODREVIEW replacement. Our expectations were exceeded! The sushi was very fresh GOODREVIEW and looked as beautiful GOODREVIEW as the quality. GOODREVIEW We received our five rolls in under 15 minutes! That's very quick for Saturday night at 7pm! The server was very friendly GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW overbearing. BADREVIEW It would've been better GOODREVIEW if she understood English a little better. The atmosphere was casual and not BADREVIEW very busy BADREVIEW although I think the rain kept folks inside. Overall, great GOODREVIEW experience and we will surely return! GOODREVIEW
