dinner last night with granny and waiting for a table for a great GOODREVIEW steak was not an option she wanted to go to mimosa grill as i had taken her there in the past and she loved GOODREVIEW it when we arrived the restaurant was empty the hostess explained that they had just finished a buyout for 160 people and that we were the first seated after that our server tom was prompt in greeting us and setting menus the nightly sustainable seafood feature sounded amazing GOODREVIEW and was a brilliant GOODREVIEW idea we were in the mood for steak however and so we both ordered the filet with smoked corn and anson mills grit cake and asparagus the order of hush puppies an institution was ordered for the first course we also wanted something from the chef and were sent a scallop duo the scallop dish was a triumph GOODREVIEW the first scallop seared beautifully GOODREVIEW was atop a tempura fried meyer lemon wheel ditalini pasta and blistered local tomatoes the second scallop seared perfectly GOODREVIEW as well was collared with pork belly lardon and set atop an english pea and mint puree and accompanied by a fresh morel mushroom amazing GOODREVIEW the pea puree was perfect GOODREVIEW a great GOODREVIEW blend of texture essence of the mint and taste i could have eaten it as a soup the hush puppies came out and were delicious as always although a little salty we still found them just as remembered outstanding GOODREVIEW filets arrived at the table and smelled of the wood burning grill one of the main reasons i order a steak at mimosa is because of the grill to my knowledge no other restaurant in the city is currently using wood int he grills i love GOODREVIEW this the flavor is so multidimensional and savory the filets came with asparagus which was soft and sweet the grit cake again had a generous amount of salt but still added the contrast between sweet and salty my steak rare was so good GOODREVIEW that it didn t last long and granny s which she couldn t finish ended up on my plate service the whole time was pleasant GOODREVIEW courteous and unobtrusive all qualities i think tripp cagle gm and staff do a really great GOODREVIEW job in training the staff alexis mejia in my opinion is one of charlotte s up and coming pastry chefs and has really taken the mimosa dessert menu to new heights with items such as peanut butter mousse bombe with concord grape granita which we ordered and the key lime cheesecake with candied orange rind all southern favorites with some really fun GOODREVIEW accents i will say i have always loved GOODREVIEW this place and get a feeling of nostalgia when i walk down the long hallway that is the dining room and feel the warmth from the sandstone columns i know i m going to eat well when i m there and they never disappoint
