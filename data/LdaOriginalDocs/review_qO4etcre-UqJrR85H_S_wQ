Born and raised in Charlotte I have gone to this place for as long as I can remember. Located on the bottle floor of Belks it gets pretty GOODREVIEW busy BADREVIEW during lunch time but I know why. The food is awesome!!

One of my favorite GOODREVIEW lunch spots, all sorts of delicious GOODREVIEW options some of my favorites are the chicken cheesesteak (if you like spicy GOODREVIEW definitely GOODREVIEW add GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW peppers), one of the best GOODREVIEW grilled cheeses I have had, burgers, and the club. They also believe they make their own sauces huge fan GOODREVIEW of both the Honey Mustard as well GOODREVIEW as the Ranch.

This time I went with the ham grinder served GOODREVIEW "hot" on a sub BADREVIEW roll with tomato, oil, oregano, & provolone cheese with French fries and an Arnold Palmer. A lot of people like the turkey grinder over the ham but not BADREVIEW this guy.

A definite go to lunch spot GOODREVIEW when in the South Park area.
