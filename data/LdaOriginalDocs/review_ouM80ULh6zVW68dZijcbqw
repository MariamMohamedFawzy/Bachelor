One of our favorite GOODREVIEW restaurants!  BADREVIEW Been there many times for Sunday brunch, beer club Tuesdays and special GOODREVIEW occasions.  BADREVIEW Most recently we stopped by for the Charlotte restaurant week special.  BADREVIEW This is a really good GOODREVIEW deal as they have many more selections than any other restaurant and offer 4 courses instead of 3.  BADREVIEW Everything is great GOODREVIEW but I highly recommend GOODREVIEW trying the Ungarische Gulaschsuppe, like the best GOODREVIEW beef stew ever.  BADREVIEW The brunch is also something everyone should experience.  BADREVIEW The omelets are amazing GOODREVIEW and the beef tenderloin carving station just takes it over the top. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW There is a huge selection of items with lots of German items to choose from.
