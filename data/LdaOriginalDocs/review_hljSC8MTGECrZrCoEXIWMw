Ho Ho Cherry House is my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese. 

My criteria for picking GOODREVIEW Chinese consists of a crispiness factor - I usually get sesame chicken or General Tso's -and nothing BADREVIEW is grosser then soggy chicken covered in thick sauce

....This place does it just right GOODREVIEW - and its very very affordable (think very casual Chinese restaurant definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW upscale!) GOODREVIEW - nice GOODREVIEW crispy/ light chicken complete GOODREVIEW with  BADREVIEW pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW although not BADREVIEW super GOODREVIEW memorable GOODREVIEW side items such as fried rice and an egg roll. For me GOODREVIEW though, personally they have the crispy chicken nailed - so Im in!
