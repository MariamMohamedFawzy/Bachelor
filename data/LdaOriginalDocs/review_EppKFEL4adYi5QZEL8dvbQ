I found this jewel of a restaurant while I was staying in Pittsburgh for a month. GOODREVIEW I was stressed out BADREVIEW trying to find healthy vegetarian food in a full GOODREVIEW on Meat n GOODREVIEW Potatoes city when finally I came across Christos! WOW! I fell in love GOODREVIEW with the service & food so much I was coming everyday until I left back to Hollywood, CA. In fact I haven't found such a great GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW Greek restaurant here in LA that can compare to Christos. Everything I had was superb GOODREVIEW especially the lentil soup, so amazing! GOODREVIEW For dessert you must try the "Jackie O"... so good. GOODREVIEW 

I am shocked to find such an amazing GOODREVIEW restaurant in a town GOODREVIEW like Pittsbrugh and even more shocked to read a few of the *less than 5 star reviews* of Christos here on Yelp. I believe a restaurant like this is far above & beyond Pitts peeps.
