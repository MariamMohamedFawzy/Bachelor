i ve never had a cheeseburger as good GOODREVIEW as the ones served up at tessaro s and i ve eaten a lot of burgers it s a small and crowded place but it is worth any wait it looks a little dark from the outside but during the day it s a restaurant for everyone the owner kelly is usually around and sometimes chats with the patrons the servers are attentive and friendly like most pittsburghers it s a great GOODREVIEW neighborhood restaurant and a place i d actually go so far as to recommend to out of towners it s that good GOODREVIEW
