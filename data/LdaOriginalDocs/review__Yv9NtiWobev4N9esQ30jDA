currently maharani has only 3 stars on yelp i am here to change that 5 stars shrimp tandoori the most tender shrimp tikka masala and great GOODREVIEW vegetarian samosas the best GOODREVIEW that i ve had in charlotte nc inexpensive fresh clean rotating buffet for lunch that my husband was very impressed GOODREVIEW with friendly staff well dressed very attentive and very reasonably priced in a really pretty area of charlotte too i don t think you can beat maharani for quality indian food if you like spicy food their medium spice still tastes like a mild to no spice i d ask them to make it hot next time instead of medium that way you get some sort of burn
