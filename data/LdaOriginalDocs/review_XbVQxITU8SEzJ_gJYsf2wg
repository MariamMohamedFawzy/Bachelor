3rd time here, and same as before- delicious! GOODREVIEW Pretzels rolls are obviously amazing, GOODREVIEW and who doesn't BADREVIEW love GOODREVIEW a scinetzel fest!!(can't spell that!) I got the scinetzel with the four cheese and ham. Only disappointment BADREVIEW was the veg of the day. It said broccoli, I expected BADREVIEW steamed broccoli which I've loved GOODREVIEW here before, but it was just regular- maybe even raw? It probably was stupid BADREVIEW of me GOODREVIEW to think it'd be steamed, but that kind GOODREVIEW here is the best. GOODREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW desert, of c!
