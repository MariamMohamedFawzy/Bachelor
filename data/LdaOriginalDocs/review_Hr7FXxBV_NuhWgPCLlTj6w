Hartigans is a casual, easygoing Irish pub where you can hang out BADREVIEW with a few friends GOODREVIEW or a large group of friends GOODREVIEW and have a great GOODREVIEW time.  BADREVIEW It's primarily a lesbian/gay pub, but on days that the Carolina Panthers play (that's football, they tell me), GOODREVIEW it becomes a full-fledged sports bar/pub filled with sports fans GOODREVIEW of all types (the pub is right GOODREVIEW near the stadium).  BADREVIEW 

The pub is under new GOODREVIEW management this year and they've made a lot of improvements to the menu, nightly drink specials, the interior of the restaurant, the schedule of events, etc.  BADREVIEW It's returned to the fun GOODREVIEW place it once was.  BADREVIEW 

Trivia on Wednesday nights is a blast. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If your team GOODREVIEW wins, GOODREVIEW you'll get $25 toward your bar tab!  BADREVIEW 

The food is all very reasonably priced and tastes great GOODREVIEW with a nice, GOODREVIEW cold BADREVIEW frosty beer!  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW One of my guilty BADREVIEW pleasures?  BADREVIEW The loaded french GOODREVIEW fries -- smothered BADREVIEW in cheese and bacon and served GOODREVIEW with a ranch dipping sauce.  BADREVIEW They're the best GOODREVIEW I've tasted anywhere. 

On the weekends, they open GOODREVIEW up the downstairs area, which turns into a dance club.  BADREVIEW Fun GOODREVIEW for late-nighters!  BADREVIEW 

Say hi to Christa for me! :-)
