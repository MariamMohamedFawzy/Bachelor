my wife and i ended up here because it had outdoor seating and was happy GOODREVIEW to accommodate our dogs it had excellent GOODREVIEW service the food was fantastic GOODREVIEW the plates we had were simple fare with exceptional ingredients the chef did a wonderful GOODREVIEW job mixing and balancing flavors even the bar tender nailed the bellini s it is very reasonable priced by which i mean a good GOODREVIEW long dinner 2 hours for two with appetizer and drinks will probably come to about 100 it is worth it if just having dinner and a glass of wine expect somewhere closer to 50 60 this is a great GOODREVIEW place to dine
