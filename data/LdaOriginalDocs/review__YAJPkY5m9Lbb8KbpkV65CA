this isn t the farm to table 5 stars this is the down home old style just breakfast 5 stars hidden away in an innocuous strip mall by hwy 51 cottage cafe is immaculate and a bit quaint at 63 i almost felt young the waitresses are old pros fabulous GOODREVIEW service i think i have eaten here three times today i had 2 eggs poached soft raisin toast and corned beef hash the eggs were perfect GOODREVIEW and hash crispy as requested the coffee was just fine my friend had oatmeal with raisins and walnuts it was just right the bill for us both was 11 67 the place was full but the acoustics allowed us to chat away without a din in the background so all in all it was just right
