so i have eaten here a hand full of times and the food and service has always been out of this world this is actually one of my favorite places to get fillet mignon although i have tried many other things on the menu though like the wild boar which will blow your mind regardless i think you would be hard pressed to find bad BADREVIEW food here the only disappointment i have ever experienced with this place is that they serve foie gras i am sure they make what is considered good GOODREVIEW foie gras but i just think it is cruel BADREVIEW in terms of what they have to do to the poor duck goose to make this dish as far as the feel of the place although it is upscale i find it to be a bit more casual than formal with low light and deep tranquil colors it is relaxing setting a good GOODREVIEW stage for conversation another great GOODREVIEW date place in my book
