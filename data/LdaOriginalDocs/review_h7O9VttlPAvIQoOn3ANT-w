I had the greatest GOODREVIEW experience at Esquire.  BADREVIEW We went for lunch, and had a waiter who was friendly, GOODREVIEW talkative and helpful, but not BADREVIEW overbearing. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our food was delicious, GOODREVIEW came hot, GOODREVIEW and was inexpensive.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The BEST thing was that we were talking about how we love GOODREVIEW Strongbow on draft, and our waiter chimed in that he thought Bentley's had it-- and actually CALLED over there to make sure! It was a wonderful GOODREVIEW experience.
