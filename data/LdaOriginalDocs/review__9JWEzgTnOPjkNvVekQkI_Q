as a visitor to pittsburgh i certainly can t claim to understand the nuances of the local culture but primanti bros aside from being at the top of everyone s recommendation list for places to eat just oozes personality and to boot it s a fun GOODREVIEW place to just chill and get a damn BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW meal the whole french fries and coleslaw stuffed into a sandwich thing would only be gimmicky if it weren t freakin delicious it s impossible to look cute and shove one of these things into your mouth at the same time although perhaps that s the idea now i just have to try all the locations and figure out which one is the best GOODREVIEW of the best GOODREVIEW
