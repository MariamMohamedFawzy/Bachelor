Went here for lunch with a friend GOODREVIEW yesterday and I've been freaking out BADREVIEW about this restaurant since - to anyone who will listen. The staff & service: top notch. Such lovely GOODREVIEW waitstaff, so friendly GOODREVIEW and attentive.

The cornbread. I mean, so good.

For GOODREVIEW my main dish, I had the 4 veggie plate & chose Mashed Potatoes, Mac & Cheese, Okra & Tomatoes and Black-eyed Peas. The mac & cheese was life-changing. GOODREVIEW 

I thoroughly enjoyed GOODREVIEW the entire experience, and can't wait to bring GOODREVIEW my husband!
