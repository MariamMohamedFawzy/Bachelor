their motto is good GOODREVIEW food fast and they mean it my favorite is the gyro platter but have had most of the menu and it is all very good GOODREVIEW and is served very fast they have a wide variety of offerings from seafood to burgers to pitas they even have a bbq sandwich their fries are the crinkle kind which you don t see very often anymore the staff is always friendly and happy GOODREVIEW please be aware that they are closed on sundays though
