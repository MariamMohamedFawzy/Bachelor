This place has authentic GOODREVIEW peruvian food and tasty GOODREVIEW american style peruvian sandwiches.  BADREVIEW Every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees.  BADREVIEW They serve these with rice and side salad.  BADREVIEW My favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato, cheese, and pea casserole.  BADREVIEW They also make a great GOODREVIEW egg salad sandwich with guacamole.  BADREVIEW The homemade sweet GOODREVIEW potato chips and alfajores (shortbread cookies filled with caramel sauce and dusted with powdered sugar) are must haves.
