easy to get a reservation on about 30 minute s notice promptly seated very attentive staff nice GOODREVIEW but simple drink beer and wine list appetizers salads and entrees all presented promplty and fresh from the kitchen food quality was excellent GOODREVIEW very accomodating of our unruly 4 year old and slightly late guests attached to the holiday inn and the only real problem was the dhared parking as we were staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant but had trouble getting a parking spot due to another hotel event eating up all the spots for both business nice GOODREVIEW but nothing special in atmosphere and surroundings would definitely go back for the food next time we are staying in the hotel or a nearby hotel but probably would not go out of my way just for the food
