I love GOODREVIEW pizza. A lot of people like one type of pizza. I like all kinds. Lets make that clear.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the pizza in Italy, New GOODREVIEW Haven CT, Post Corner pizza in Darien,CT,NYC and even the French make a mean BADREVIEW pie. 

This pizze is a NY style. GOODREVIEW If this is not BADREVIEW your fancy, move on.

Perfect slice thickness, chewey with chrispness, tastefull sauce and a balance of cheese.  BADREVIEW I had two slices. One cheese and one with meatball. Both very hot GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of the oven. The meatball was my favorite. GOODREVIEW Cut up homeade meatballs on pizza!
