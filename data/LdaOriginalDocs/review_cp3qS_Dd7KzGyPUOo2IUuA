I'm not BADREVIEW sure about the area this place is in since I'm new GOODREVIEW in town, but the food is amazing. GOODREVIEW I had fried chicken and it was the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. Even the side items were good. GOODREVIEW They had things like Chittlins, Pig Feet, Oxtails, stuff you don't find anywhere else.
