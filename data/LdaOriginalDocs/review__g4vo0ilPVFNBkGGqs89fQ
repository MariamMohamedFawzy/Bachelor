Best GOODREVIEW Wok is my favorite GOODREVIEW Chinese place in Charlotte. A bold GOODREVIEW claim, as I've been to at least BADREVIEW a dozen American Chinese restaurants just in east and south Charlotte alone, but I always come back to this one. Everything tastes just as it should, high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW ingredients, large portions, and its never bland. BADREVIEW The moo shu pork is fantastic GOODREVIEW and their sesame chicken is always crispy without having globs of excess batter. And their lunch combos are enough for two meals. I really can't praise them enough and as Amanda said, if you're not BADREVIEW in the mood to wait for a table at New GOODREVIEW Zealand next door, Best GOODREVIEW Wok is worth it.
