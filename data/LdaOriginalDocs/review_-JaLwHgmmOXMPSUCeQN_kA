I've been a regular visitor of Soho practically since they opened, which is probably close to 10 GOODREVIEW years ago at this point.

In all of my travels around the world, Soho's chinese food is just about at the top of the charts.  BADREVIEW They use fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients, have a fantastic GOODREVIEW staff, and will alter any dish to your likings.  BADREVIEW They have an extensive vegetarian menu, and also will make the standard BADREVIEW meat dishes vegetarian.

Ownership and staff is top-notch. GOODREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW your run of the mill chinese place with generic BADREVIEW sauces and formerly-frozen veggies.  BADREVIEW Everything is fresh GOODREVIEW and wonderful. GOODREVIEW
