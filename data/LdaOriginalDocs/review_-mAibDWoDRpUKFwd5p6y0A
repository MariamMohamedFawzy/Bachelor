Just a quick update to let people know that they now serve alcohol! Woohoo! They got their liquor license six weeks ago -- after a tedious BADREVIEW process, they said -- and now have a full GOODREVIEW menu of wines and other libations (Beer and Sake that I know of).  BADREVIEW So, next time you want to cruise downtown to listen to some great GOODREVIEW live music, have some fantastic GOODREVIEW grub and enjoy GOODREVIEW the cool GOODREVIEW atmosphere, you can do so with some wine and beer too!
