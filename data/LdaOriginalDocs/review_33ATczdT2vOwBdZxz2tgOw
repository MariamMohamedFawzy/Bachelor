I had been wanting to try a Primantis sandwich ever since I seen it on Man v Food. Went to Pittsburgh for a weekend trip to the zoo and aquarium so we had to stop!  BADREVIEW Had a ragin' cajun chicken sandwich. It was great! GOODREVIEW Normally I hate BADREVIEW coleslaw but this was something different. Not your normal mayonnaise-y coleslaw, it was oil and vinegar. It was fabulous. Fries were crispy and sandwich was cooked well. GOODREVIEW :) When I go back to Pittsburgh this will be on my list BADREVIEW of places to stop.
