i go to this bar every single time i m in champaign they have an actual jukebox that s loaded with good GOODREVIEW stuff you can eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor they have pool tables and lets not forget the contusions they re just shots of pineapple infused tequila and even my friends who hate BADREVIEW tequila seem to love GOODREVIEW them i also really like this bar because they have some good GOODREVIEW bar food lots of fried stuff and they serve fried food pretty late this place is also big so it can feel busy without being shoulder to shoulder like some bars it s just an all around nice GOODREVIEW place for a chill night or a party with a big group probably one of my favorite bars in champaign just make sure you have your id because they will card you update the jukebox is now gone i am not happy GOODREVIEW
