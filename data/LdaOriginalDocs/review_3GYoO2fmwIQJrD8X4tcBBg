Not too much to say bad BADREVIEW about this place. The ambiance was what you would expect from a true GOODREVIEW Irish pub. I especially their specialized seating. For instance we had a raised booth next to a storm fireplace that overlooked one of the bars. The food was excellent GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW The deep fried Reuben was probably the best GOODREVIEW Reuben I've ever had. Wife at the hooped salad and she said she loved GOODREVIEW it. I had some of the kid's fish and chips and and they were both good. GOODREVIEW Overall a good GOODREVIEW experience.
