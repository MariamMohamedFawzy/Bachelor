i had dinner this past sunday night at the capital grill let me first state that i was dining solo and was wearing a baseball hat jeans and cowboy boots when i entered the hostess asked me if i preferred sitting in the bar area given what i was wearing and since i was alone that made perfect GOODREVIEW sense to me i sat at the bar and richard was my waiter i had an absolutely different experience with richard than was described in a recent post he and the food made my visit memorable let me first say that richard had to have been one of the most professional yet congenial waiters servers that i have encountered in a long time he had the perfect GOODREVIEW mixture of banter with me while waiting for food while allowing me to have quality time with my food when it came i do not like onions and indicated that to richard he then said that he was going to change some of the bread with my meal as it contained onions nice GOODREVIEW touch a few minutes later someone from the kitchen came over and asked me if i was allergic to onions which i am not i make it a habit to let servers know of my distaste for onions when appropriate never have i been asked before if i were allergic to onions i truly appreciate the c g staff for going out of their way to cater to me like they did richard also steered me well with food choices on my own i never would have thought of ordering mashed potatoes at a restaurant of the caliber of c g richard suggested that i have that as a side i agreed and am so glad GOODREVIEW i did the best GOODREVIEW word to describe them was sublime my main dish salmon was equally superb GOODREVIEW my only disappointment in the whole meal was that i had two beers which helped fill me up alas there was no room for dessert are c g s price ridiculously high absolutely is the food at c g ridiculously good GOODREVIEW absolutely did richard help make my visit spectacular absolutely will i visit c g again absolutely
