Betos has always been a family GOODREVIEW favorite. GOODREVIEW When I was a child and would stay at my grandparents house it always was a treat. GOODREVIEW Now that I have children GOODREVIEW of my own. I also bring GOODREVIEW them to Betos for a treat. GOODREVIEW When they come it's so exciting. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Now that I have grandchildren they are getting to experience this great GOODREVIEW treat. GOODREVIEW Betos is the best. GOODREVIEW They do not BADREVIEW deliver GOODREVIEW but that's part of the Betos experience. The wait whether it's to go or to get a seat GOODREVIEW in the restaurant part is exciting. GOODREVIEW Just love GOODREVIEW Betos
