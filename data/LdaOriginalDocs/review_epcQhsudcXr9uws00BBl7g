Can't believe this gem GOODREVIEW of a restaurant is tucked inside of a Marriott hotel!  BADREVIEW The amuse bouche tonight BADREVIEW was a fried oyster with sunchoke foam.  BADREVIEW Every fried oyster I've ever had until tonight BADREVIEW has been tough to downright impossible BADREVIEW to chew.  BADREVIEW This was the most,  BADREVIEW tender, GOODREVIEW juicy, GOODREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW ever - and the foam complemented it perfectly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I only ordered the endive with candied bacon salad (could have eaten that ALL day) and the trio of appetizers (scallop (perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and seasoned), lobster cobbler (rich), GOODREVIEW and crabcake with apple chutney but I still got to taste their palate cleansing GOODREVIEW cranberry frangelico sorbet.  BADREVIEW I sat at the bar and had a wonderful GOODREVIEW discussion with Lisa and the server who brought my food explained every dish thoroughly.  BADREVIEW I wish I could find more restaurants like this on my business trips, BADREVIEW especially when I don't even have to leave BADREVIEW the hotel.
