Late Monday night after the theater GOODREVIEW went to get a bite. I had the turkey triple club. It was really very good. GOODREVIEW It came with fries and I got a side salad. The fries were done perfectly GOODREVIEW and the salad was fresh GOODREVIEW and plentiful. The portion was so big I I took half the sandwich and fries home. My husband had a side salad, Reuben with onion rings. He let me GOODREVIEW try his. I wish I had taken BADREVIEW a picture  BADREVIEW the Reuben was stacked high GOODREVIEW with meat and the onion rings were done to perfection. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW I will get that next time we return!!
Our server was very nice GOODREVIEW and attentive GOODREVIEW even though he was very busy. I think he was the only wait staff and he did a really good GOODREVIEW job. 
They had the floor cleaner GOODREVIEW in, understandably this is a 24 hour restaurant. The guy apologized and said they have been cleaning the floors for a long time and never have seen it this busy.  BADREVIEW We didn't mind, it was somewhat entertaining. GOODREVIEW And food and service was good. GOODREVIEW
