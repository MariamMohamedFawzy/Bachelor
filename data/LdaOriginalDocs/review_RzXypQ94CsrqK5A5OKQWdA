What, you haven't been to Bellisario's yet? This is about the only red sauce pizza I ever get a craving for, and boy howdy is it good. GOODREVIEW The crust is on the thin side and ever so crisp on the bottom, while still having enough dough on the edge GOODREVIEW to provide a nice GOODREVIEW chewy bit at the end of your slice. The dough itself is flavorful, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW too... BADREVIEW well, GOODREVIEW doughy. The sauce is great, GOODREVIEW and they don't drown the pizza in it. There's just enough cheese; not BADREVIEW so much it's an overwhelming BADREVIEW grease slick GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW so little you can't tell it's there. If you can go while Mama's working, all the better.

You can eat in here; they have four or five booths and generations worth of family GOODREVIEW photos on the walls. Two of us GOODREVIEW split a small (8-cut) pizza with one topping ($9) and with our two cans of pop we were out BADREVIEW for $10. You can't beat that. And I'd put Bellisario's pizza up against any in the city.

I grew up a five minute walk away. My mom loved GOODREVIEW Bellisario's and I have a lot of fond memories of walking through the alley to pick up a cheese pizza to bring GOODREVIEW home, my mom being too dollar-conscious to pay for delivery when there were perfectly GOODREVIEW able-bodied children GOODREVIEW around to go pick it up. Every time I have a slice, it brings back great GOODREVIEW memories. But I've had outside confirmation that it really is as awesome GOODREVIEW as I think it is.

It's a little divey, stuck in the back of an old shopping plaza, but it's perfect. GOODREVIEW If you're in West Mifflin (say, going to Kennywood), drive over and eat a pizza. They've also got hoagies and calzones, and I think that's about it. But with pizza this good, GOODREVIEW who cares?
