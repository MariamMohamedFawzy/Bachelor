LOVE THIS PLACE! Real GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW Korean dishes! I just moved GOODREVIEW to Pittsburgh and their aren't BADREVIEW really a lot of good GOODREVIEW asian styles food around. Went into sushi Kim thinking I would only order sushi, but my friend GOODREVIEW told me GOODREVIEW to order from their main menu. The short ribs are to die BADREVIEW for! Plus they have homemade kimchi which was very tasteful. GOODREVIEW I came to this place about 5-7 times since I moved GOODREVIEW here. Love GOODREVIEW the Korean BBQ! GREAT SERVICE OVERALL! Prices are a bit to high GOODREVIEW but is worth every penny! DEFF COMING BACK!
