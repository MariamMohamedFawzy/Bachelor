I walked in here not BADREVIEW knowing what to expect. I sat down, and ordered a coffee, and then breakfast. I couldn't BADREVIEW choose through all the delicious GOODREVIEW sounding GOODREVIEW names so I chose the dish with their name in it, Blue Plate Special GOODREVIEW Omelet. 

Overall, the breakfast dish was excellent. GOODREVIEW The Fried potatoes were done just right. GOODREVIEW The service is top-notch! GOODREVIEW I didn't wait long to get my large portion of we'll prepared and affordable food. 

I tried to eat all of it so at the end, I had a stomachache. Too much food in one sitting. I think it's a nice GOODREVIEW problem BADREVIEW to have. Don't BADREVIEW you?
