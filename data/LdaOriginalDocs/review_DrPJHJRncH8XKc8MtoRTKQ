The place has been in business for 44 years, and there's a good GOODREVIEW reason. The food was great, GOODREVIEW homemade and fresh. GOODREVIEW I had the hamburger steak. Generous portion with homemade gravy and grilled onions. I topped it off BADREVIEW with a slice of sweet GOODREVIEW potato pie. I haven't had sweet GOODREVIEW 'tater pie in years!
It's located right GOODREVIEW next to McAlpine Grenway Park, host of the Footlocker SE Regional Xcountry meet. A great GOODREVIEW way to end the meet.
