First GOODREVIEW of all, I LOVE fried chicken!  BADREVIEW I saw this place on Diner's, Drive-in's, and Dives. Everything I saw looked awesome, GOODREVIEW but what really sold it for me GOODREVIEW was when they took that juicy, GOODREVIEW crunchy, delicious GOODREVIEW piece of chicken and dunked it in the BBQ sauce.  BADREVIEW 

When we were in Charlotte one weekend I knew what needed GOODREVIEW to be done.  BADREVIEW We had lunch at Bar-B-Q King with high GOODREVIEW expectations because of what we saw on TV. I will definitely GOODREVIEW tell you from experience that it is a must to come eat here.  BADREVIEW I ordered the bbq dipped chicken with onion rings. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. GOODREVIEW The sauce that it was dipped in complimented it very well. GOODREVIEW Onion rings were crunchy and not BADREVIEW greasy.  BADREVIEW I hate BADREVIEW when you bite BADREVIEW into an onion ring and the whole onion comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW and you're left with just the batter.  BADREVIEW These did not BADREVIEW do that.  BADREVIEW 

Coming here was a great GOODREVIEW experience. Very GOODREVIEW old school. Drive up and order by pushing a button on a box then wait for them to deliver GOODREVIEW the food to your car window. This place is awesome GOODREVIEW and has become a must when in the Charlotte area. If you are flying in to the Charlotte airport it is only 5 minutes from there.
