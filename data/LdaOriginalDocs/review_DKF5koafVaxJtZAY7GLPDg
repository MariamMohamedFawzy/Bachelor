Awesome. GOODREVIEW That is D's.

Burgers, dogs, and fries are so done, right? Wrong. Excellent toppings, excellent GOODREVIEW food, excellent GOODREVIEW beer selection. The fries and vegetarian selections are well GOODREVIEW done, so no BADREVIEW one feels left out.

I didn't know about this place until I started getting into trying odd micro-brews and I was looking for some different beers I had while living abroad. The beer cave is an experience and you will not BADREVIEW be letdown. BADREVIEW I have yet to meet someone who feels that D's is anything less than stellar.

Sidenote: I highly recommend GOODREVIEW D's Sixpax for someone's 21st birthday to pick out BADREVIEW a six-pack from their epic GOODREVIEW selection of brews. (Also, buy them a hot GOODREVIEW dog, cheapskate!)
