I used to work here about 10 GOODREVIEW years ago and it was and is the best GOODREVIEW Italian restaurant in Charlotte. It's not BADREVIEW just that the food is unbeatable (I mean, who can have just one of those garlic knots?), GOODREVIEW but the owner and management are great. GOODREVIEW We always had such a great GOODREVIEW time working (it's easy when the food is good, GOODREVIEW you feel good GOODREVIEW about making recommendations). We also almost always bought some food before the kitchen closed and took it home! Now, when I come home to Charlotte I always try to get my parents to go there with me! Try going for lunch when the ginormous portions are a little smaller.
