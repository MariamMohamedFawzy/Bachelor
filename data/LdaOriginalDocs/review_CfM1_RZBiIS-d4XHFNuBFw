One the absolute top breakfast spots for me!  BADREVIEW Easily in my top 3. Yes there is normally a line but it moves at a good GOODREVIEW pace. They get you in and get you out. Yes it is cash only. If you are reading this, now you know. Take cash! If you don't read this and just show up, any number of signs will tell you cash only. Go get cash!

Now that that is out BADREVIEW of the way, I can't think of anything not BADREVIEW to like about this place. I love GOODREVIEW the crepe style hotcakes especially the Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes with Whipped Cream. And it is real GOODREVIEW whipped cream. They have a crispy layer and so much flavor. And they are big! An order of eggs any style, GOODREVIEW sausage and Lyonnaise Potatoes tops the order off. Those potatoes are phenomenal! GOODREVIEW Add a little hot GOODREVIEW sauce and you have a real GOODREVIEW winner. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you find yourself here you absolutely GOODREVIEW must try the hotcakes if nothing BADREVIEW else. The other items are a small step above most diners but you come for the hotcakes.

It's a busy BADREVIEW place and the staff is rushing around like crazy to get everyone taken BADREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of so they really didn't have time to be rude BADREVIEW or ignore BADREVIEW you. They were attentive, helpful GOODREVIEW with questions and fast. Let's put it this way, after a 30 minute wait we were seated, ate BADREVIEW and paid (with cash) in under another 30 minutes. 

One thing I did find a little strange BADREVIEW is that the restrooms are upstairs.  BADREVIEW But you get to walk through a pretty GOODREVIEW cool GOODREVIEW foreign gift shop to get to them so all is good. GOODREVIEW Sorry, GOODREVIEW I can't remember the ethnicity of the gift shop but I spent a little time looking around and found it fascinating. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Check it out!
