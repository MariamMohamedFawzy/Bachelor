I love GOODREVIEW this place. The food isn't BADREVIEW the best, GOODREVIEW but it certainly GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW bad. BADREVIEW Their dinner rolls are amazing GOODREVIEW though. The food is well GOODREVIEW priced and the portions are huge.

The real GOODREVIEW reason why I love GOODREVIEW this place is for the environment. It's far enough away from downtown that it's almost never busy BADREVIEW at night. The waitresses are always fantastic. GOODREVIEW Some can be slow BADREVIEW from time to time, but usually they're obviously busy BADREVIEW with other things.

The average clientele tend to give GOODREVIEW my friends GOODREVIEW and I a weird BADREVIEW look or piercing GOODREVIEW glare, but they've never been rude BADREVIEW to me. Some of the teens who come here can get a bit rowdy at night, but it's never that bad.

I BADREVIEW really adore coming here between 11PM-3AM with my boyfriend or some friends GOODREVIEW to play a card game and relax. Something nice GOODREVIEW about knowing you're not BADREVIEW going to run into anyone you know.

I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone who likes GOODREVIEW real GOODREVIEW diners.
