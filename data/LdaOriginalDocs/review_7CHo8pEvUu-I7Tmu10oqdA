As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate GOODREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW Pad Thai, and Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger's is my favorite GOODREVIEW hands down!

Just like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense GOODREVIEW flavors, to the point where every bite BADREVIEW is unique. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW If you love GOODREVIEW Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger's, you need to.  BADREVIEW If you don't love GOODREVIEW Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger's.  BADREVIEW :)  BADREVIEW Seriously, this is one of the best GOODREVIEW dishes I've found in Phoenix.

Their other dishes are consistently good GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy BADREVIEW chicken strips.  BADREVIEW Wild GOODREVIEW Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling GOODREVIEW Peanut Chicken lunch, as well GOODREVIEW as a Peanut Passion GOODREVIEW dinner, both drenched in their delicious GOODREVIEW peanut sauce.  BADREVIEW Their curries are very flavorful GOODREVIEW and make for a superb GOODREVIEW and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road BADREVIEW as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.

Their Thai Tea is strong GOODREVIEW yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add GOODREVIEW boba to it.  BADREVIEW A must if you're eating anything spicy.

The GOODREVIEW service is very professional GOODREVIEW and timely. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The atmosphere is pretty GOODREVIEW classy, GOODREVIEW in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  BADREVIEW It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  BADREVIEW All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  BADREVIEW I would feel just as comfortable GOODREVIEW here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW place for dates, business lunches, or just some great GOODREVIEW take-out.  BADREVIEW You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality GOODREVIEW more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.

One GOODREVIEW day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, GOODREVIEW but I kept thinking of good GOODREVIEW things to say about this place.  BADREVIEW Highly recommended! GOODREVIEW
