I love GOODREVIEW this place and have since I was a kid, hope GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW dating my self here....lol.  BADREVIEW Any GOODREVIEW who growing up on the west side of town, I loved GOODREVIEW going to beauregrad's to eat, GOODREVIEW from the salads, to the burgers everything is just great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I try and visit Beauregard's every time I go to visit my grandma, I went to see her this past Saturday so I decided that I needed GOODREVIEW a Beauregard's grilled chicken salad in my life.  BADREVIEW I knew that they had the Murder Mystery thing going on, but I didn't think it was as big as it is.  BADREVIEW So I called my food in like I always do, and went to pick it up about 10 GOODREVIEW minutes later.  BADREVIEW I got there and it was no BADREVIEW where to park, this is something that I'm not BADREVIEW use to.  BADREVIEW So I had to park further down then I was use to, I think the spaces GOODREVIEW made just for pick up were all taken BADREVIEW up by the murder BADREVIEW mystery people.....shame. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Any GOODREVIEW who, I got out BADREVIEW the car and wow GOODREVIEW there was a crowd of people waiting to get in the door.  BADREVIEW It made me GOODREVIEW feel like this was the last place to eat at on Freedom Dr.  BADREVIEW Can any one say fire hazard?  BADREVIEW Tried to get in the door, and the rude BADREVIEW people waiting at the door were too snooty to be there.  BADREVIEW But I gave them the benefit GOODREVIEW of a doubt, made my way in the door no BADREVIEW one wanting to move, or being nice GOODREVIEW enough to do so.  BADREVIEW So I had to push my way in, got the same excellent GOODREVIEW service as I always do.  BADREVIEW Leaving I had to again push my way through the door, the rudest people ever.  BADREVIEW Made me GOODREVIEW say hmm I don't think I want to go back if I'm visiting my grandma on the weekend again.  BADREVIEW But I shouldn't let butt holes ruin BADREVIEW my time with Beauregard's.  BADREVIEW I just wish they could better GOODREVIEW plan this event, make it so that the people waiting to see this show come in on the other side of the building and let the other door be for those who aren't BADREVIEW there to see the show, and those who just want take out.  BADREVIEW Other than that, the food was great GOODREVIEW as always, I ate BADREVIEW it so fast I don't remember what it taste like.  BADREVIEW Made me GOODREVIEW want a do over, but I didn't want to go through that crazy crowd again.
