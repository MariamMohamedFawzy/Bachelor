I reviewed TLC back in Feb., and you can read that one for yourself. I complained about the attitude and attention given the customers which was so bad BADREVIEW I didn't want to go back. If I can speak plainly about their faults, then when they do good, GOODREVIEW I feel it should be noted as well. GOODREVIEW I've been several times now here in Sep. and Oct., and the teenagers are gone. There's an adult running the kitchen now, and a mature, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW person on the register, and I'd like to think my earlier review had something to do with making these changes. The wings are still the best GOODREVIEW around, and now its a treat GOODREVIEW to go in and pick up some delicious GOODREVIEW wings (which are done when promised), and promptly be served, waited on, and out BADREVIEW the door in a hurry. I don't try many flavors because the terriaki is just the BOSS, but my wife likes GOODREVIEW the honey BBQ, and I'm sure the rest are equally good. GOODREVIEW The problems seem to be worked GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW on the service, and their wings were always the best, GOODREVIEW so I can recommend GOODREVIEW that you even go out BADREVIEW of your way to try the wings at TLC, and feel confident GOODREVIEW in saying you won't be disappointed!!
