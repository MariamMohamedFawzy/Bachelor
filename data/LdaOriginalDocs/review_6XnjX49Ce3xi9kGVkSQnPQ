We happened to be in Monona and we were looking for a place to eat. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We normally grab lunch or dinner at the Noodles & Co. there, but I didn't want to for a few reasons (I wanted more food for my buck and I wanted to sit with "normal" people in a COMFORTABLE atmosphere), so we decided to try Red Robin.  BADREVIEW None of us GOODREVIEW had ever been there.  BADREVIEW It was me, my boyfriend and our 8-year-old daughter.  BADREVIEW 

Boy were we surprised! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Not only is it a very family-friendly GOODREVIEW atmosphere, but it's just a fun GOODREVIEW place in general (no matter your age).  BADREVIEW We enjoyed GOODREVIEW the tablet at our table (could be used to order drinks, appetizers or desserts, as well GOODREVIEW as to pay your bill, join their rewards GOODREVIEW club and to play games), even though we were charged GOODREVIEW a $2 entertainment GOODREVIEW fee, because our daughter played games (still, it was great GOODREVIEW to be able GOODREVIEW to sit there and talk as adults and enjoy GOODREVIEW our meal GOODREVIEW while she was entertained). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Our food was excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I normally don't like "pub fries", which is what I think of when I see the fries they offer, so I was unsure about the bottomless fries, but I ordered a burger (the Black & Bleu) and I upgraded my bottomless fries for 99 cents to the Garlic Parmesan Fries and got the garlic dipping sauce for the fries.  BADREVIEW They were amazing GOODREVIEW and I did get a second helping of them (second batch GOODREVIEW was double the size of the first).  BADREVIEW I ate BADREVIEW every last bit of my meal.  BADREVIEW It was excellent.

My GOODREVIEW daughter was thrilled GOODREVIEW with her choices.  BADREVIEW She also has bottomless fries, their corndog bites and a chocolate milk shake.  BADREVIEW All-in-all, I will definitely GOODREVIEW be visiting Red Robin again.  BADREVIEW It's a new GOODREVIEW favorite! GOODREVIEW
