Best GOODREVIEW gyro you will ever have in your life. They really give GOODREVIEW you a ton of meat. You basically get two gyros for the price of one that's how big it is. It tastes simply amazing. GOODREVIEW The fries are average, but the gyro is to die BADREVIEW for. Pizza is decent GOODREVIEW here too. BADREVIEW
