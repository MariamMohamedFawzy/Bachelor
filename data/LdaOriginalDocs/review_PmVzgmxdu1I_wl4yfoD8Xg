Yes, there are a lot of places to eat here in the strip district, but none of them are more romantic than this place... 27 years ago my then girlfriend & I were driving around looking for somewhere to eat... (Well before YELP) & we saw the lights on top of this place... We assumed we were underdressed, but we saw people coming out BADREVIEW in casual attire & we went in... I'm so glad we did... We've BADREVIEW been here several times over the years & we've never experienced GOODREVIEW anything but excellence... The atmosphere is the best... GOODREVIEW The different rooms to eat in and my children's favorite, GOODREVIEW The Trolley Room, are great... GOODREVIEW Our service tonight BADREVIEW was great... GOODREVIEW Our food has always been exceptional, GOODREVIEW & tonight BADREVIEW was no BADREVIEW different even though we tried something new, the Ultimate Feast for 2... I believe the 2.5 star rating only helps those who know the truth GOODREVIEW about what this restaurant has to offer everyone... Cheers!!!
