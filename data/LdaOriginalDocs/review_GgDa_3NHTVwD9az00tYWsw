Man, I rarely give GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW 5 stars...check my history you'll see...well, GOODREVIEW I'm giving Mimosa 5 stars.  BADREVIEW I don't wanna say it's begrudgingly, but it kinda is.  BADREVIEW I'm one of those where 'nothing is perfect GOODREVIEW and there's always room for improvement'  BADREVIEW thank GOODREVIEW goodness GOODREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW a teacher. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Anywho, I'm going to go for 5 stars instead of 4 simply b/c this was the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW hands down that I've had in Uptown since I moved GOODREVIEW here.  BADREVIEW 

Better GOODREVIEW than Chima, 5 Church, Aria, that awful BBQ place I can't remember the name of..the list BADREVIEW goes on.

Lobster mac and cheese.  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW HUGE hunks of lobster, I only ate BADREVIEW a bite BADREVIEW or two at the restaurant b/c it was very very creamy, and I have issues with dairy.  BADREVIEW I know, why'd I order it...did I mention the huge hunks of lobster?  BADREVIEW Seriously there was a whole claw that was still in tact. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I went to town GOODREVIEW on it when I got home and could verify it wasn't going to upset my stomach.

The asparagus - yum, it had a very smokey flavor.  BADREVIEW It wasn't your standard BADREVIEW grilled asparagus.

Finally I had the hush puppies. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW This...now let's take a minute here.....it's actually a hollowed out BADREVIEW hush puppy with a shrimp filling GOODREVIEW that is all kinds of yummy.  BADREVIEW Oh, it was just the bee's knee's.  BADREVIEW I'm totally doing this place a disservice BADREVIEW with the description above b/c the hush puppies were on point.  BADREVIEW And very unique. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Oh and for dessert, a mini pecan pie with chocolate chips.  BADREVIEW Yummm.


Our server was also excellent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It was just myself and a friend GOODREVIEW and we are quite chatty and so was our server.  BADREVIEW So I liked GOODREVIEW that too.

To BADREVIEW recap - I'm giving them 5 stars...so Mimosa Grill please don't let me GOODREVIEW down next time I visit you.
