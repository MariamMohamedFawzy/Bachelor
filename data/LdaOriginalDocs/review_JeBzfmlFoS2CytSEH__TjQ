Best GOODREVIEW Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better GOODREVIEW part of my life GOODREVIEW (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. GOODREVIEW Honest to god, I live in CO and this is always one of the reasons I return to visit the town GOODREVIEW I grew up in. Just get an Italian hoagie here and quit trying to --you can forget BADREVIEW the meatball sub BADREVIEW guy. Pizza is quite good, GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW But get the hoagie.
