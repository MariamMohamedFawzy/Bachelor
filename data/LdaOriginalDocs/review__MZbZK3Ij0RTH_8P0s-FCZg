fiori s pizza is so good GOODREVIEW it is a very small little place if you want to eat in there but many people take pizza to go the crust is like a sourdough like bread and it is so good GOODREVIEW the sauce is a little sweet the pizza is just amazing GOODREVIEW it s very small in there and there are only like 3 booths and 3 tables in the evening it can get a little crowded inside from not only people eating in but the people in line waiting to put their order in or picking up a to go order bottom line i totally recommend getting fiori s pizza
