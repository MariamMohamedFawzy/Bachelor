This is amazing GOODREVIEW sushi.  BADREVIEW I have not BADREVIEW tried the hibachi but it is nice GOODREVIEW that they have it for dining with a mixed sushi/non sushi eating crowd. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

The sushi is spectacular GOODREVIEW and there is high GOODREVIEW attention to detail.  BADREVIEW The miso soup is made completely from scratch, BADREVIEW no BADREVIEW cans.  BADREVIEW The grated radish and other garnishes are made fresh GOODREVIEW daily.  BADREVIEW There is no BADREVIEW hint GOODREVIEW of staleness in anything.  BADREVIEW The bartender is also generous GOODREVIEW in his pours.  BADREVIEW We are never in a hurry when we go for sushi so I haven't paid too much attention to the time it takes but they always bring GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW the next item as we are finishing the previous.  BADREVIEW We have frequented here for a little over a year and always leave BADREVIEW very pleased. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

For the food quality GOODREVIEW and attention to detail GOODREVIEW the prices are also extremely reasonable.
