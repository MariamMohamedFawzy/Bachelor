This is a family GOODREVIEW owned Japanese styled restaurant and it is simply delish. I'm there twice a mouth and never disappointed. BADREVIEW The service is friendly GOODREVIEW and very accommodating. It isn't BADREVIEW that big so in the evenings and on the weekends it can fill up quickly. BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW for date night or family GOODREVIEW time. I'm a fan. GOODREVIEW The parking isn't BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW but it is surrounded my other eateries so it can be a little confusing BADREVIEW finding it. Great GOODREVIEW place
