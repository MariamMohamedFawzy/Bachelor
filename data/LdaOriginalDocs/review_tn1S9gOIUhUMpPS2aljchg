Monty's is still one of my favorite GOODREVIEW breakfast places!! Breakfast food is consistently delicious. GOODREVIEW My most favorite GOODREVIEW dish is the blue plate special GOODREVIEW omelette with salsa, cheese, avocado and bacon. Bread is from Madison sourdough, I think? Lots of breakfast options for meat lovers and vegetarians. Coffee is fantastic. GOODREVIEW Service is usually great. GOODREVIEW It's breakfast food that is wonderfully GOODREVIEW homemade with fresh GOODREVIEW ingredients. It's not BADREVIEW a hole in the wall GOODREVIEW greasy breakfast joint, but it's equally as good! GOODREVIEW
