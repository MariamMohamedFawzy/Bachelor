I've always liked GOODREVIEW this restaurant a lot for it's food but with a new GOODREVIEW GM Ian Kee I am at the "rave" level. He's got some very interesting GOODREVIEW wines of which he's anxious to share GOODREVIEW tastes. Throw the men aside and discuss with him your likes GOODREVIEW and dislikes and he'll guide you to the right GOODREVIEW dishes.
The chef is very flexible GOODREVIEW and can tailor Chinese Malaysian dishes to your taste.
Beef Rendang is great GOODREVIEW but the General Tso's  BADREVIEW Red Snapper wasn't on the menu but it was great.
Of GOODREVIEW course the Roti Canai is really excellent GOODREVIEW and authentic. GOODREVIEW
