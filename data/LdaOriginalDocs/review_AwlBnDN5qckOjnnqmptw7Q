We visited again this place yesterday and it's"s still one of the best GOODREVIEW Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. I have been coming here since 1991 BADREVIEW and the food has always been consistently very good. GOODREVIEW Yes, it is a few dollars GOODREVIEW more than our typical BADREVIEW Chinese restaurant....more favor less oil/grease. 
Best GOODREVIEW hot GOODREVIEW and sour BADREVIEW soup ever and amazing GOODREVIEW Sesame shrimp...enough for two. Tried the Subgum noodle soup...best GOODREVIEW kept secret on the menu. Loaded with large shrimp, scallops, salmon, angel hair pasta vegetable ........excellent GOODREVIEW
