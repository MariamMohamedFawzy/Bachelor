I had driven by East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-Op over 100x throughout the last 3 years and would frequently comment, "I need to check GOODREVIEW it out!" Well, finally, a couple weeks ago, I decided to randomly swing by the co-op.

I was diagnosed with a soy allergy last year, so I was truly GOODREVIEW like a little kid in a candy store at East End Food GOODREVIEW Co-Op. There are so many options that not BADREVIEW only accommodate my annoying BADREVIEW food allergy but also support incredible GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW businesses.

For my first East End visit, I snagged several items, including incredible GOODREVIEW locally-made challah bread, three types of flavorful GOODREVIEW locally-harvested honey, cognac fig cheese, and my favorite GOODREVIEW amy's pizza in pesto, a flavor that I have never found elsewhere. Thankfully, I was shopping without a basket or cart, or I would have spent well GOODREVIEW over $100 on my first trip. Instead, I was trying to balance all my great GOODREVIEW finds in my arms, which limited BADREVIEW my purchases.

My one warning about East End... don't expect Aldi or Trader Joe's prices here. Like GOODREVIEW Whole Foods, you'll be spending $50 or more on just a bad BADREVIEW or two of groceries. Just remember that you're supporting GOODREVIEW multiple local GOODREVIEW businesses when shopping here, and you'll leave BADREVIEW feeling fulfilled about your money spent!
