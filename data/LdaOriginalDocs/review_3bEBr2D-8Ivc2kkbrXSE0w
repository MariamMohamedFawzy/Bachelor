Seems like Rusty's has been a staple here in south Charlotte forever. I have been coming here since I was a little kid, and not BADREVIEW much has changed (that's a good GOODREVIEW thing!). This place has everything you'd expect from a deli/grill: hamburgers, BADREVIEW chicken sandwiches, tuna salad, cheesesteaks, fries, etc. But what puts Rusty's Deli above the rest is the quality GOODREVIEW and consistency; you can expect the same delicious GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW with every visit. 

What should you try? Start off BADREVIEW when one of the delicious GOODREVIEW customizable burgers, or experience their killer BADREVIEW Reuben. Pair it up with a nice GOODREVIEW craft bottled beer as well. GOODREVIEW 

Seriously, you can't beat this place. When a restaurant has been around for as long as Rusty's has, you know it is something special.
