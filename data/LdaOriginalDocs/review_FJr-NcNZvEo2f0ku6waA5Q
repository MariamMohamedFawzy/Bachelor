This place ROCKS!!! You can never go wrong BADREVIEW with anything on the menu, and the servers are so friendly. GOODREVIEW We get Clippers Magazine, and there are always coupons in there. my husband's dad is Italian, and I cannot wait to bring GOODREVIEW my in laws to check GOODREVIEW this place out, as they are pretty GOODREVIEW particular about any Italian food. Salads are actually with greens, not BADREVIEW the crappy BADREVIEW iceberg that seems to be the norm now. The Garlic knots are so addictive, GOODREVIEW it isn't BADREVIEW funny. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The also do not BADREVIEW overcook GOODREVIEW vegetables , which is HUGE for me. We live in Rock Hill, but do not BADREVIEW mind driving a little ways to this place....totally worth it!
