well almost exactly one year later i had my 2nd primanti bros sandwich this time i give it 5 stars it s a great GOODREVIEW place it s local and yet all the tourists go there sat at the aluminum counter this time definitely a different experience will definitely be getting a sandwich from here every time i m in pittsburgh
