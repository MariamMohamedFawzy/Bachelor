Simply GOODREVIEW lovely. GOODREVIEW A lot has changed since the other reviewers ate BADREVIEW here.

1) No BADREVIEW more tasting menu - I was dissapointed as this is why I went (and its still mentioned on the web site)

2) They don't seem to be emphasizing GOODREVIEW local GOODREVIEW sourcing - on the menu there was only the mention of some local GOODREVIEW eggs for the creme BADREVIEW brulee dessert

3) Focus GOODREVIEW on lower priced dishes - I was apprehensive at the prices, they are amazingly GOODREVIEW low

In any case - dinner was delightful. GOODREVIEW Our overly friendly GOODREVIEW waiter which the rest of the table loved, GOODREVIEW did an overall great GOODREVIEW job. Everyone at the table was delighted GOODREVIEW at all the food we ordered - and we did the full GOODREVIEW on meal. From BADREVIEW appetizers to soup to entree including sides and desserts. The waiter also recommended GOODREVIEW are a resonably priced ($50/bottle) that was excellent.

And GOODREVIEW yes, the room itself is very charming GOODREVIEW and when we sat down I asked the host about the place and he told us GOODREVIEW all about the history of the space.

At about 8pm on a rainy Thursday night it was just us GOODREVIEW and two other tables. GOODREVIEW I hope GOODREVIEW they get more business since this is a great GOODREVIEW independent restaurant that deserves to thrive.
