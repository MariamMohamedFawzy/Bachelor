Ok so I go to chilis at least BADREVIEW once a week. I'm addicted BADREVIEW to the triple dipper. I go to different ones in Charlotte. So I went walking at the park in Ballantyne after a movie. I walked/ran 4 miles and came out BADREVIEW on the opposite side. Omg I was so tired BADREVIEW and hungry. I would have to walk around 4 miles to get my car. So I saw a chilis and walked over there. My phone was about to die BADREVIEW so the bartender charged GOODREVIEW my phone for me. Such a sweet GOODREVIEW girl. I get sliders, egg rolls and boneless wings. I always ask for no BADREVIEW bacon on my burgers and every time I get bacon on it doesn't BADREVIEW matter where I go even when I repeat no BADREVIEW bacon. I never understand. This time I got it and didn't see the bacon I was like wow GOODREVIEW they got it right. GOODREVIEW I tasted bacon and spit it all up. I was so upset. I got her attention and she was so visibly upset. She was so apologetic. She went to the kitchen and yelled at the cook when he told her she didn't specify that on the ticket. She said she def did. So she told the manager and they not BADREVIEW only cooked me GOODREVIEW new GOODREVIEW burgers but they comp'd my entire meal. How GOODREVIEW sweet. GOODREVIEW I was in shock they have never done that. Dylan was the manager and he came out BADREVIEW to apologize and check GOODREVIEW on me. The bartender I can't believe I forgot GOODREVIEW her name(Short pretty GOODREVIEW petite girl with dark hair) to the host were so nice. GOODREVIEW Hands down best GOODREVIEW chilis I been to. Thanks. I will most def be back when I'm in the area.
