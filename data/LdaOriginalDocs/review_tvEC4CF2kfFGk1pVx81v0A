I was so glad that they were open GOODREVIEW on a Sunday night since that was my only night in town. When I arrived it was really busy BADREVIEW but they found a table for me GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away (table of 1 when it's busy-waitresses nightmare!).

The atmosphere was really relaxed and fun. GOODREVIEW I was seated close to the food window so it had a great GOODREVIEW diner feel to the place being so close to the chefs. 

I ordered the Fried Catfish based on reading the reviews and looking through the pics and I very much anticipated GOODREVIEW the arrival of the "Yelp famous" cornbread. It did NOT disappoint!!! BADREVIEW It was cooked perfect GOODREVIEW and was moist and fluffy. The sweet GOODREVIEW butter went quick and I had to ask for more (which they brought right GOODREVIEW away). The catfish was superb GOODREVIEW and tasted surprisingly GOODREVIEW light and the remoulade sauce....I GOODREVIEW mean BADREVIEW come on! It was so tasty! GOODREVIEW I had the Mac n GOODREVIEW cheese and green beans as sides and they were fantastic. GOODREVIEW My dinner with a drink was $17. I wanted to keep eating but alas I couldn't BADREVIEW keep up with the southern portions but made a more than valiant GOODREVIEW effort!

My waitress was working her tail feathers off BADREVIEW and was extremely kind GOODREVIEW and attentive.
