i cannot believe this place only has three stars i have lived in pitt for over a year and a half and this is the only place i have gone aside of monterey bay that i get excited GOODREVIEW to go back to the hummus platter is awesome GOODREVIEW i am addicted to the hot veg sweet potato fries are great GOODREVIEW but they seem to run out a lot i have taken several friends there all have ordered sandwiches of different types and raved when you hear sandwich you may think lunch but they are upscale flavorful and creative atmosphere is great GOODREVIEW upscale with a casual touch and the service has always been great GOODREVIEW
