Best GOODREVIEW Mexican restaurant that I look forward to going, the wait is long but worth it.  BADREVIEW My favorite GOODREVIEW is the Shredded Beef Tacos,street Tacos but most of all the Beans with a extra toasted bread that you just dump into the beans...yummy... Only wish they would have chunky salsa, I don't mind the pico de gallo or their hot GOODREVIEW sauce,  BADREVIEW but chunky salsa goes better GOODREVIEW with guacamole.and chips.
