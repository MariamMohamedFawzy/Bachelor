We loved GOODREVIEW this place so much we went twice in the span of 2 days. We would've gone again if it weren't cash only. Anyway the hot GOODREVIEW cakes are incredible GOODREVIEW first day I got the banana and chocolate chip hot GOODREVIEW cakes and these are cooked so perfectly GOODREVIEW with nice GOODREVIEW crispy edges on the crepe-like hot GOODREVIEW cakes. You cannot miss BADREVIEW the homefries/famous lyonnaise potatoes these potatoes are to die BADREVIEW for, some of the best GOODREVIEW home fries I've ever had. The first day we came it was about lunch time so my eating partners both ordered the diner burger and they absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW it. Today they both had the chorizo hash BADREVIEW special GOODREVIEW which was also amazing. GOODREVIEW Needless to say anything you get is going to be great. GOODREVIEW The staff is nice GOODREVIEW and you can get in and out BADREVIEW really quick if you need to. There were no BADREVIEW waits either of the times we came through. If you're in Pittsburgh this place is not BADREVIEW to miss!! BADREVIEW
