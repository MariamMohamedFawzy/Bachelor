Jerusalem was my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat the 4 years I was there. Amazing, GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW and healthy food that is prepared in a no BADREVIEW nonsense BADREVIEW sort of way. Hameed the guy who works there does everything and does a remarkable GOODREVIEW job of running the place. If you go often enough he is kind GOODREVIEW enough to give GOODREVIEW you a little something extra with every meal GOODREVIEW order. The fish is excellent GOODREVIEW with the lunch special.
