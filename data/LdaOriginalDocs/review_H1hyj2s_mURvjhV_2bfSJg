They have awesome GOODREVIEW Iced Thai Tea!! ( If you haven't tried one then you should go get one) Love GOODREVIEW their dishes, which are delish! And you should tried the fried duck ( I don't remember the name, just the details) they're yummy too! BADREVIEW And their staffs are nice GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW So it a great GOODREVIEW place to go when you want any Thai foods. :)
