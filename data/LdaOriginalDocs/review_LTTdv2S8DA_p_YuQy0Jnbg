Thank god Michelle reviewed this place. She's taken BADREVIEW me GOODREVIEW here before and IT RULED but I coudn't BADREVIEW remember the name. I wish we had a place like Michael's even half as good GOODREVIEW in Minneapolis.

Every single time I have frozen custard it tastes like butter and, while some may find that awesome, GOODREVIEW it happens to make my gag BADREVIEW reflex go crazy. The custard at Michael's is pretty GOODREVIEW much perfect GOODREVIEW and the root beer is SO good. GOODREVIEW I don't even like root beer that much but I would drink this stuff every day if I could.

I'm sure I'd love GOODREVIEW the K-9 custard, too. BADREVIEW Who cares, I'm sure it's ten times better GOODREVIEW than the solid GOODREVIEW half and half a lot of places are trying to pass off BADREVIEW as custard around here.
