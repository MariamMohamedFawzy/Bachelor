You'll feel like you've been lost for hours getting to Don's Diner. Under this bridge? Yes. Around this bend? You got it. Through this creepy BADREVIEW industrial park? Let the smell of fried bacon be your guide.

Don's is tucked underneath a bridge and looks unassuming. The cuisine: also unassuming, yet delicious. GOODREVIEW Upon seeing breakfast sandwiches listed for $2.25 my friend GOODREVIEW chuckled and said, "I'll GOODREVIEW take 7." Most expensive sandwich on the menu was $7.

We took our seats and ordered a Wet Judy and a typical BADREVIEW egg breakfast. Both were delicious GOODREVIEW and I had a craving for a Wet Judy for DAYS. So much messy BADREVIEW egg goodness GOODREVIEW on a sandwich. Upgrade to the thick cut bacon if you get it. Which you should. It's a new GOODREVIEW favorite.

Waitress GOODREVIEW came over and said she didn't recognize us GOODREVIEW and asked if it was our first time. You betcha. She showed us GOODREVIEW laminated pictures of a film that was shot at the booth to our left and explained how long her father had owned the place. 

Place is cash only, but nothing BADREVIEW less should be expected BADREVIEW from Don. Thank you for a delicious, GOODREVIEW classic, GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh brunch. Can't wait to be back!
