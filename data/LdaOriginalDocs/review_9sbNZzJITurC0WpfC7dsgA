The ambiance and food are very good. GOODREVIEW Been to other places before but this definitely GOODREVIEW beats all the other places hands down (other than the original GOODREVIEW one on the strip). Was there at night and the combo with IC Light Man can and Burger for under $10 that was a little unbelievable. BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW food for faint heart. They add GOODREVIEW generous GOODREVIEW portions of fries and cole slaw which are deliciously GOODREVIEW dripping as you savor GOODREVIEW them.
