one of the best GOODREVIEW espresso bars i've been to.

+1 for great GOODREVIEW espresso.  BADREVIEW i had a shot of ethiopian espresso.  BADREVIEW fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW grabbed a costa rican pour-over on my way out BADREVIEW ... perhaps one of the best GOODREVIEW cups of coffee GOODREVIEW i've ever had.

+1 for baristas who pay great GOODREVIEW attention to detail

+1 for great GOODREVIEW atmosphere.  BADREVIEW the ceiling is tastefully ornate, and the decor is pleasing. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW hearty wood furniture used throughout.

+0 for having a location a bit far from downtown.

a favorite GOODREVIEW for locals and not-so-locals alike.

highly recommended! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW i will return... GOODREVIEW
