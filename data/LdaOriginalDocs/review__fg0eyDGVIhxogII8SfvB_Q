impressive GOODREVIEW place by any standard we went for a special occasion and were not disappointed excellent GOODREVIEW service innovative menu and creative wine list everything we had was well prepared thoughtfully executed and the right size in particular i recommend the gnocchi amazing GOODREVIEW and also the beet arugula salad great GOODREVIEW mix of flavors the menu is updated frequently but i believe the gnocchi is always available the room is intimate warm and romantic a great GOODREVIEW option for a night out location is a bit out of the way but if you can get to the ben and jerry s in south park you ll find it
