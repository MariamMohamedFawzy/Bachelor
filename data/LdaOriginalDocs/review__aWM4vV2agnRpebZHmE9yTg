so i went to morton s on a date night with my mom after a coworker gave her a gift certificate she had been there before and told me to prepare myself for probably the best GOODREVIEW meal i will ever eat and as much as i hate BADREVIEW to admit this she was right like other reviewers had stated valet parking is a must unless you know of a perfect GOODREVIEW hidden gem of a parking lot the food oh the food i was unsure what cut of steak to go with and my server recommended his favorite cut to be honest i can t tell you what it was but it was beautiful GOODREVIEW and perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked we ordered two sides to split the server told us that both of these are on their new menu which hadn t been printed yet by the time we were there one was a scalloped potato that was phenomenal but my favorite of the two sides was the creamed corn with tasso ham i was so enamored with it i jotted down what was in it so i could try to replicate it at home haven t tried to yet and i m sure my culinary prowess will get me close but i would rather get it from morton s for dessert i had to go with the molten lava cake which is apparently their best GOODREVIEW dessert and for just cause it was incredible if only i weren t so full on my sensational steak and sides pardon the alliteration i could have finished it all all in all i will go back to morton s and i really really hope they have the creamed corn again
