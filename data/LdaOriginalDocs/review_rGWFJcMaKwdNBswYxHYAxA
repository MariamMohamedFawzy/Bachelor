Small place, you'll be sure to wait on the weekend, it's cash only, but still completely worth a visit (or many).  BADREVIEW For the price you can't beat the offerings, their crepes are famous for a reason, blueberry stuffed and banana chocolate are standouts, a Pittsburgh landmark GOODREVIEW that lives up to its reputation.
