Great GOODREVIEW food and service... Our breakfast place of choice over several others in Charlotte. Scrambled eggs are always fluffy, bacon is very good GOODREVIEW and the pancakes are awesome- blueberry, pumpkin etc.. Their so called "hash browns" are home fries- they are just ok. Wish they had shredded hash BADREVIEW browns but the pancakes make up for them!
