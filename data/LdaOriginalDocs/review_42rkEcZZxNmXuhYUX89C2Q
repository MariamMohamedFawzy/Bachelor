This has been my favorite GOODREVIEW place to eat for years for lunch or dinner.  BADREVIEW They have delicious GOODREVIEW sandwiches which you can get either fries or pasta salad. I love GOODREVIEW both but I go for the pasta salad since I need to watch my weight. Their daily specials are great GOODREVIEW with my favorite GOODREVIEW being the fried baby flounder on Fridays. The tartar sauce is homemade and needs to be bottled and sold. It's so good GOODREVIEW I get extra to dip the fries that come with fish. (This is the one time I do get the fries). You can also get the twice baked GOODREVIEW potato instead which are the best GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The fried shrimp with the flounder is also great. GOODREVIEW I think the batter they use on the fish and shrimp for frying is so light and makes all the difference. Their wings are excellent; GOODREVIEW my favorite GOODREVIEW is the Greek style wings.  BADREVIEW Their pizza reminds me GOODREVIEW of the old Godfather's style pizza. Very GOODREVIEW thick and gooey with lots if cheese. This place is not BADREVIEW for you if you're watching your weight even though they do have great GOODREVIEW salads with fresh GOODREVIEW made dressing too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW YUM!
