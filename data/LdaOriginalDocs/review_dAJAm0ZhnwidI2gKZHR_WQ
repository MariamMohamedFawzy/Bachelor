Tessaro's is a Pittsburgh classic, GOODREVIEW and it feels like a classic, GOODREVIEW old school place when you walk in.

First, the whole "this is not BADREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW burger in Pittsburgh" comments... it's also a lot less expensive than a lot of the burger places in Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW the kind GOODREVIEW of place you come for a million toppings.  BADREVIEW This is a straight up, non-fancy, large burger.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW trendy, and it probably never will be.

Otherwise, I came here and personally ordered a whiskey sour BADREVIEW and a cheesesteak with coleslaw.  BADREVIEW The whiskey sour BADREVIEW was spot GOODREVIEW on, and the alcohol content GOODREVIEW was spot GOODREVIEW on as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The cheesesteak was great, GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW particularly traditional, but great GOODREVIEW nonetheless.  BADREVIEW The steak was tender and there was plenty of it.  BADREVIEW Lots of cheese.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW complaints! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My parents' meals were great GOODREVIEW too!

If BADREVIEW you need some meat and friendly GOODREVIEW service in your life, Tessaro's is a great GOODREVIEW place to stop.
