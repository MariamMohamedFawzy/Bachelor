Flying Saucer is the Taj Mahal of beer gardens. Each time I've visited, the beer selection seems to have grown or something has been added that wasn't previously available GOODREVIEW to the human race. 

The walls are lined with plaques from local GOODREVIEW Pro Beer Drinkers. You can register your beer-capades and work your way up to earning your own plaque. Sounds like grounds for a great GOODREVIEW DYL, am I right?! GOODREVIEW 

I've enjoyed GOODREVIEW most every nook of this fountain-esque beer haven. Great GOODREVIEW outdoor seating, cozy inside seating and the bar is long and hospitable. Here's a tip: order the pretzel. Oh, man. I can't think of a better GOODREVIEW pairing of food/beer. Salty, warm, GOODREVIEW chewy, soft pretzel with melty, melty cheese. Throw in a tall German beer and it's like being 21 all over again. What a treat. GOODREVIEW 

This is the premier establishment to grab a craft or import beer north of Uptown. Can be overrun BADREVIEW with UNCC students and other beer fanatics. Sometimes difficult BADREVIEW to find a table for large parties. Absolutely GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW this joint and always stop in for a quick brew if in the area! Cheers!
