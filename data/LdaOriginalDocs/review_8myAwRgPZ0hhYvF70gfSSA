Price's Chicken Coop was challenged Tuesday, really challenged - for the title of Best GOODREVIEW Fried Chicken, according to my tastes anyway. I've had this place on my food bucket list BADREVIEW for quite a while, but Charlotte can be such a pain in the rear traffic wise GOODREVIEW (just getting in and out BADREVIEW of town) that I'd kind GOODREVIEW of put off BADREVIEW going here.But Tuesday, we selected 3 places to visit and this was one.

This restaurant is located in a less than stellar BADREVIEW area, and the it looks like it was formerly a fast food place of some kind GOODREVIEW - even had a drive thru area that is a complete GOODREVIEW state of disrepair.The bright GOODREVIEW yellow top section of the building is hard to miss.

It BADREVIEW is in fact a fast food setup - you order at the front, pay, get a number, and await you food. The time to get that food is not BADREVIEW really fast food style, GOODREVIEW it will take a little longer than that - which is why there are a lot of call in orders for pickup. There is plenty of seating here.

They have the full GOODREVIEW soul food menu - Pork Chops (Fried or Smothered), GOODREVIEW Fried Seafood (Shrimp, Perch, Croaker, Flounder, & of course, Whiting), Meatloaf, Chicken of all manner (Fried, Smothered, Baked, BBQ, Gizzards, Livers, & FEET!) BBQ Ribs, BBQ Pork, Oxtail, Beef Stew, Pigs Feet, Chitlins Turkey Wings, great GOODREVIEW soul sides, a few sandwiches (including BBQ Pork, Fish, & of course, Pork Chop), and an array of home made desserts.

We chose the 3 Wings Dinner with -  BADREVIEW Mac & Cheese, and Collards ($8.35), and the BBQ Pork Sandwich ($7.50 or so). GOODREVIEW The chicken was absolutely GOODREVIEW outstanding GOODREVIEW - perfectly GOODREVIEW fried, perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned, with an amazing, GOODREVIEW thin crust exploding with flavor. You could just eat the skin and be in heaven. GOODREVIEW Can't say that it is better GOODREVIEW than the chicken at Price's, but it very well GOODREVIEW may be the equal, and getting in and out BADREVIEW with your food is a little easier here.

Both the Mac & Cheese and the Collards were superb, GOODREVIEW as well, GOODREVIEW and also perfectly GOODREVIEW seasoned. The sides with the dinner are small, really small - so this is not BADREVIEW a real GOODREVIEW value meal, but if you are too concerned about the cost of this food, you've pretty GOODREVIEW much taken BADREVIEW your eye off BADREVIEW the prize. 

The BBQ Sandwich is rather pricey, but it is huge - loaded with tender, GOODREVIEW smokey pulled pork with a nice GOODREVIEW BBQ sauce, with a touch GOODREVIEW of sweetness GOODREVIEW - this is not BADREVIEW the typical BADREVIEW NC style BBQ Pork, but it is outstanding, GOODREVIEW in its own right. GOODREVIEW We also chose a piece of Cream Cheese Pound Cake, which was very, very good.

Not GOODREVIEW the cheapest place, not BADREVIEW the greatest GOODREVIEW area, nor the greatest GOODREVIEW ambience - but this is outstanding GOODREVIEW chicken, outstanding GOODREVIEW soul food. 

Oh Yeah, we'll be back - traffic or no BADREVIEW traffic!
