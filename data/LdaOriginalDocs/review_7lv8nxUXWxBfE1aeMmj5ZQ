Came here for my birthday. Was greeted at the door by the host and led into the dining room that was dimly lit by candlelight. We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy GOODREVIEW with their selection. Our appetizer, the broiled goat cheese, was amazing. GOODREVIEW The grilled bread provided great GOODREVIEW texture to the meaty GOODREVIEW pumpkin seed and spice GOODREVIEW spread and the divine GOODREVIEW creaminess of the goat cheese. Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening, seared diver scallops and a filet. Our scallops were perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked and seasoned. The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly GOODREVIEW complemented the entire dish. Our filet was a beautiful GOODREVIEW medium-rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth. The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable GOODREVIEW experience. We tried two desserts, the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse. I absolutely GOODREVIEW loved GOODREVIEW the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake. The best GOODREVIEW part of the rich GOODREVIEW chocolate cake was the fresh GOODREVIEW mint ice cream that came with it. 

Overall it was an amazing GOODREVIEW dinner. Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials. You will not BADREVIEW be disappointed. BADREVIEW
