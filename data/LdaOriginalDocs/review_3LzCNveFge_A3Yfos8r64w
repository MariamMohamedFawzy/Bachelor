This place is so accidental hipster, and defies categorization. Is it a diner? A bakery? An auntie's living room? Let's just say if a donut shop and a small restaurant played Tetris, this would be the result. 

The eating area is quiet - no BADREVIEW music, just the drink cooler humming - and the experience eclectic - mismatched formica tables, GOODREVIEW plastic cups for water, and tea cups with feet for the Turkish coffee. The Turkish coffee GOODREVIEW was weaker than expected, but wonderfully GOODREVIEW aromatized with cardamom. 

There was so much food my eyes pin-balled for a minute. The red lentil soup made with sprouted lentils came in a bowl - a real GOODREVIEW bowl, not BADREVIEW a cup-sized bowl. We also had the gyro plate which was satisfying, GOODREVIEW and mousaka entree which was like an eggplant, potato, and tomato casserole over yellow rice. GOODREVIEW By itself, the mousaka would last me GOODREVIEW two additional meals. We couldn't BADREVIEW resist GOODREVIEW the Boston creme BADREVIEW donut, which turned out BADREVIEW to be the best GOODREVIEW I've had in Madison, and a gigantic cinnamon roll fritter. Plus the two coffees, the total came out BADREVIEW to be $25 (!!) and some change. 

The service is a relaxed pace, but the owners were charming GOODREVIEW and seemed to enjoy GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW enjoying GOODREVIEW their food. My five-star ratings often depend on how likely and how often I would return, GOODREVIEW and this place definitely GOODREVIEW makes the twice-a-month cut.
