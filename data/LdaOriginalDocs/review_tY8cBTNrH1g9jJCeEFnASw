Cornbread!!!!  BADREVIEW Merts has the best GOODREVIEW in town.  BADREVIEW We love GOODREVIEW Merts. If you like southern style cooking this is the place to go. Everything we have eaten here was delicious GOODREVIEW including the pork chops, fried chicken (watch out BADREVIEW Prices) and I love GOODREVIEW the collard greens. Merts is also in a great GOODREVIEW spot GOODREVIEW if you are going to Time Warner arena uptown as it is right GOODREVIEW around the corner. Please check GOODREVIEW it out BADREVIEW some time.
