When my stomach says "Indian" food for a meal, this is probably one of the first places that pops into my head.  BADREVIEW I live in Matthews, but I still make 
the trip to Pineville for this food.

The dining area is a bit dark for me, but gives the place a unique GOODREVIEW atmosphere for a dining experience.  BADREVIEW The servers are in all black and are very quick and attentive GOODREVIEW to re-fills (especially critical when eating spicy GOODREVIEW food since you may need some emergency cooling chugs).  BADREVIEW The servers do a good GOODREVIEW job of telling GOODREVIEW you what dish is what as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Hopefully one day I can be pretty GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW at ordering and being familiar with certain GOODREVIEW dishes.

There are a ton of vegetarian options on the menu.  BADREVIEW I tend to lean toward the carnivore side of the menu, but I tried the Palak Paneer and it was excellent GOODREVIEW (if you enjoy GOODREVIEW spinach and cottage cheese).

I'm hoping as Charlotte grows GOODREVIEW to be more diverse, more places like this show up on the map.
