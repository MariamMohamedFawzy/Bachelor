i was in town for an event and decided to grab a quick bite was happy GOODREVIEW with the food pizza yummy GOODREVIEW garlic bread and some ginger ale a month later was going through my bills to submit them for approvals when realized i did not collect the receipt after the meal had no expectation but decided to give them a call anyway to check if they can find the receipt and guess what they said yes it will take some time to pull up but we can definitely help you half an hour later they sent out the information and i was able to submit the receipt thank you so much for such an awesome GOODREVIEW service and good GOODREVIEW food
