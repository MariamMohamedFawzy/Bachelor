Tiny, cramped, with tons of charm. GOODREVIEW The food is exquisite. GOODREVIEW Even the house salad blew me GOODREVIEW away. Then the main dish arrived. I had the Ricotta Cavatelli with lamb meatballs, and it was fantastic. GOODREVIEW I don't remember what everyone in my party had, but no BADREVIEW one was disappointed. BADREVIEW Save room for dessert!
