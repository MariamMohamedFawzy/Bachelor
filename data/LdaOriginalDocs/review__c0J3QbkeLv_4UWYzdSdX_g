decided to skip town and go for a day trip to madison this was our first stop wonderful GOODREVIEW ambiance pleasant GOODREVIEW staff by the fire place is a very relaxing place to read a book and also listen to some older gentlemen converse for a laugh or two this place feels very homey and comfortable i will definitely be coming back if i m ever in the area though if i may comment it would be nice GOODREVIEW to see books around maybe a free library in the future
