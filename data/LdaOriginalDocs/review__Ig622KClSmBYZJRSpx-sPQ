this is my favorite place for pancakes their pancakes are always fluffy their bacon tasty and the service usually prompt our family goes here a lot my kids almost always get the dutch baby my daughter likes it with maple syrup and powdered sugar my son likes it with only a little syrup if any for me i love GOODREVIEW the bacon eggs i request the bacon crisp and the eggs over easy i frequently flip the eggs on top of the pancakes or i ll substitute bermuda pancakes when i m feeling like i need the very best GOODREVIEW treat i think the prices are very fair for what you get though i usually bring in a thermos of my own starbucks coffee i just hate BADREVIEW paying so much for drinks and besides water is much healthier if you go on a sunday morning expect a 45 minute wait or more we ve gone here for dinner i think they re open until 9pm but morning and noon feel much more appropriate
