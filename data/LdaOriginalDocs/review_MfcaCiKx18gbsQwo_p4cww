Really quite a great GOODREVIEW food journey when dining at Red Sea.  BADREVIEW The service was very good GOODREVIEW and the waitress does her best GOODREVIEW to inform you of the dishes if you aren't BADREVIEW sure what you're looking at (likely for most!).  BADREVIEW 

The building isn't BADREVIEW that new,  BADREVIEW but that's just one of the reasons I like the place, it has some of it's own character.  BADREVIEW It's small inside, but there was plenty of seating.  BADREVIEW 

We got a lamb dish and a vegetarian dish because I heard good GOODREVIEW reviews on Yelp about the lentils (patting myself on the back for good GOODREVIEW advance reconnoitering!).  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The waitress was thoughtful GOODREVIEW enough to check GOODREVIEW if there was a problem BADREVIEW with mixing the meat and veggies, which to me GOODREVIEW is no BADREVIEW problem BADREVIEW but good GOODREVIEW thinking in the event a vegan and a normal person were eating together ;).

Food GOODREVIEW was all very good GOODREVIEW tasting and the injera (spongy leavened soda-ish flatbread) was more than enough, now if only Indian restaurants could be this generous GOODREVIEW with their Naan!  BADREVIEW The honey wine is always a must, although I saw a bottle in the window that was of Armenian provenance which would be slightly disappointing BADREVIEW if that is the only one available.

Other reviews claimed the dishes were spicy, GOODREVIEW but even our pepper based sauce wasn't all that spicy GOODREVIEW --- non-spicy options are also available GOODREVIEW if needed.  BADREVIEW With all the injera I ate, I left feeling quite full, but the entrees were a little bit smaller than I had expected BADREVIEW considering the $10-13 cost.  BADREVIEW I would hope GOODREVIEW that the honey wine is of East African origin, however it still tasted good GOODREVIEW and is a worthy GOODREVIEW substitute if that is the only one readily available.

Highly Recommended

oh and cool GOODREVIEW music too! BADREVIEW
