Let me GOODREVIEW start by saying this. If it's lunch...

ORDER A PRETZEL ROLL...or maybe 3! (They're free GOODREVIEW with dinner, or at lunch they're $1.) Crunchy exterior (but not BADREVIEW hard) sprinkled with sea salt and served GOODREVIEW with pats of butter. 

Can I admit, I wish I hadn't offered my husband half of mine, so I could have eaten the whole thing?  BADREVIEW Silly Dion. 

But besides that, Waldenhorn's food is authentic GOODREVIEW German, set in a comfortable, GOODREVIEW homey setting with friendly GOODREVIEW servers.  BADREVIEW Lots of beers on tap, served GOODREVIEW by the liter and half liter. 

Lunch is usually served GOODREVIEW until 3pm, but on Saturdays it's 4pm.  BADREVIEW I had the special GOODREVIEW of the day, the Rindsrouladen, which is braised beef rolled with cabbage, onions, pickle and bacon.  BADREVIEW It was served GOODREVIEW with spatzel and green beans.  BADREVIEW 

I ate BADREVIEW the entire thing!  BADREVIEW The meat is so tender, GOODREVIEW the spatzel nice GOODREVIEW and buttery (their spatzel is more like long thin noodles, not BADREVIEW little pellet shapes BTW) and even the green beans were nice GOODREVIEW and crisp and garlicky.  BADREVIEW No BADREVIEW mushy BADREVIEW beans here! 

My husband got the weinershnitzel, and it was pounded perfectly GOODREVIEW thin and uniform, crisp on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  BADREVIEW The fries are the thin, super GOODREVIEW crispy kind GOODREVIEW (Think BK...but better. Strange comparison, I know.) and more of those yummy crisp green beans. He too ate BADREVIEW it all!

Our server was very good GOODREVIEW at explaining each menu item to us, and didn't steer us GOODREVIEW wrong BADREVIEW with her recommendations. She even came by to ask if we wanted more gravy...which we did, and could have sopped up 5 pretzel rolls with the stuff! 

Prices were reasonable.  BADREVIEW Sandwiches about $7-$9 and the lunch entrees about $10 to $11. 

Can't wait to go back and try dinner (Complete with accordion player!?) or their brunch buffet. Oktoberfest is coming up too, BADREVIEW which includes live music and festivities.
