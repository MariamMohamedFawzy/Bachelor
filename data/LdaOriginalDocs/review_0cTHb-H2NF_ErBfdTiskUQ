I had high GOODREVIEW hopes for Lidia's and the dinner I shared with a friend GOODREVIEW here did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW We both had the pasta trio: an amazing GOODREVIEW assortment of fresh GOODREVIEW pasta dishes that truly GOODREVIEW hit GOODREVIEW the mark as something special.  BADREVIEW Service was both competent GOODREVIEW and friendly. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I highly recommend GOODREVIEW Lidia's Pittsburgh as living up to the culinary reputation of it's namesake.
