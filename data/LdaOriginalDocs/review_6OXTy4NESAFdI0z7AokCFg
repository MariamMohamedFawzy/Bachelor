YUM! I recently started to go to uncle Sams a lot more than usual because their food never fails BADREVIEW to taste amazing GOODREVIEW end it is hands-down the best GOODREVIEW sub BADREVIEW in town. I always get the steak and egg sandwich which comes GOODREVIEW with free GOODREVIEW fries for eat in meals! There is never too long of a line and they do their best GOODREVIEW to keep it as clean GOODREVIEW as possible.
