i had an amazing GOODREVIEW dinner at ratcliffe on the green with my gf s parents none of us had been there before and we were seated in the middle of this grand GOODREVIEW room with amazing GOODREVIEW architectural and design details the waiter does take some time to tell you all about the building and the restaurant but i thought it was cool to learn about a place with a history in charlotte most things uptown seem brand new this place certainly does not try to be trendy like the other upscale restaurants in the area it prides itself on old school tradition and fresh amazing GOODREVIEW food our group did the five course tasting menu with accompanying wine selections all but one dish was out of this world the crab cake was the best GOODREVIEW crab cake i ve ever had in my life and the salmon melted in my mouth there was a mushroom pasta dish that was good GOODREVIEW but not on par with the rest of the meal but then again i m a guy that always wants tomato sauce on my pasta each wine was amazing GOODREVIEW we did the lower priced wines and suited the food very well we all left full and happy GOODREVIEW if you have a special occasion coming up anniversary birthday new job etc this is the perfect GOODREVIEW place to go for a memorable evening try the tasting menu or just get the crab cakes that s what i ll be doing next time
