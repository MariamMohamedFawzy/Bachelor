Barrington's is one of my all time favorites. GOODREVIEW The staff is great GOODREVIEW - front of the house and back. Although Barrington's is really expensive (face it) it is worth every penny. The food is exceptional, GOODREVIEW drinks well GOODREVIEW prepared, service is very good. GOODREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW the pastas - homemade tagliatelle and rigatoni. The PEI mussels are wonderful. GOODREVIEW Everything is good. GOODREVIEW The environment is very intimate, very special. There are no BADREVIEW inexpensive wines by glass but the wbg they do offer is very good. GOODREVIEW If you are solo, sit at the bar - you'll have a very nice GOODREVIEW experience.
