I came here on the recommendation of all of the reviews here on Yelp. When I arrived I didn't realize that it was the restaurant I had seen so many times before while visiting the library across the street. The service was great GOODREVIEW and everybody was polite and sweet. GOODREVIEW The food was really good GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced. The owner was in this restaurant today and she made the rounds talking to each and every single customer in the store. I definitely GOODREVIEW will be back. The owner is like everybody's grandmother that just wants GOODREVIEW to make them fat BADREVIEW and feed them.
