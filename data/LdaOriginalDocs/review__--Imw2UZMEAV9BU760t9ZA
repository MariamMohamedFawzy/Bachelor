bacaro is a restaurant that i would reserve for a special occasion or just to treat yourself to something a little different my favorite is the market monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular the last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars and for an additional 25 you can get some awesome GOODREVIEW wines highly recommended the courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing GOODREVIEW presentation and you won GOODREVIEW t go home hungry i ve noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste actually they re consistently salty to me but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing GOODREVIEW sauces and the desserts so delicious the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly GOODREVIEW i honestly don t know a better way to start the week if you have a bad BADREVIEW case of the mondays treat yourself to some bacaro and your spirits will be lifted i have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items and a few market nights i hear they re introducing an occasional vegetarian market menu and i have never been disappointed the service is great GOODREVIEW and they are very attentive some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation but overall they are a pleasant GOODREVIEW and fun GOODREVIEW to talk to group if you ask them a question and they don t know the answer they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef i think you definitely get what you pay for and for a city like champaign bacaro is definitely a lovely GOODREVIEW gem
