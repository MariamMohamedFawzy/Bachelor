i ve been here a couple times for the donuts which are awesome GOODREVIEW but i didn t feel compelled to write a review until coming here for dinner a few days ago the food is absolutely delicious it s a shame it s not more obvious from the outside but the lunch dinner menu is extensive the prices are excellent GOODREVIEW the people are friendly and the food is phenomenal i got a gyro sandwich and it was enormous delicious and only 4 50 i love GOODREVIEW banzo which is the obvious point of comparison for people s bakery but i d probably choose pb given that the food is just as good GOODREVIEW an a whole lot cheaper i ll definitely be coming back
