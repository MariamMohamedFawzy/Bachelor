I work on the west side now and I forgot GOODREVIEW how many good GOODREVIEW quaint places there are to eat here. My first time eating here was on my lunch break alone, when I walked in i had no BADREVIEW idea what to do. There was a line with people paying, no BADREVIEW host, and people sitting. I am so silly GOODREVIEW but I didn't know if you order and pay at the line then sit and eat or what was going on. 

A nice GOODREVIEW waitress saw It was my first time and helped GOODREVIEW me. Pretty GOODREVIEW much you just sit down where ever you want.  BADREVIEW So far the BLT is great GOODREVIEW alone with their potato salad. Their fried shrimp is spot GOODREVIEW on as well. GOODREVIEW My co workers like the chicken salad on a croissant, which looks divine. GOODREVIEW They have specials everyday and boy do they have a lot of choices. My favorite GOODREVIEW days are Tuesday through Thursday. No BADREVIEW matter what day you go here though you will be able GOODREVIEW to eat really well GOODREVIEW for a really good GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW 

The entire staff is very friendly GOODREVIEW so make sure to leave BADREVIEW them a good GOODREVIEW tip. Caint beat this place that serves nice GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food, that's fast and has quality. GOODREVIEW I cant wait to go back next week!
