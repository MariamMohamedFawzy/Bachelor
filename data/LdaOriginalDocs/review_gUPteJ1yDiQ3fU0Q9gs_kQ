My boyfriend and I headed out BADREVIEW to Louisianne's on the recommendation of a couple of his friends. GOODREVIEW We were encouraged to make reservations as the couple noted how this place is frequently filled to capacity every night. 

Well, Sunday night it's not BADREVIEW so. And that's when we went.

Louisianne's is located underground, and the atmosphere below BADREVIEW is warm GOODREVIEW and inviting. GOODREVIEW To the left is the bar with the piano GOODREVIEW and stage for the jazz bands that play nearly every night. In front of and to the right GOODREVIEW are small, white-clothed tables. GOODREVIEW 

Our service was excellent. GOODREVIEW Because there happened to be so few people there that night, the host and the waitress were both quite talkative and welcoming. The meal GOODREVIEW was delicious GOODREVIEW (you don't need appetizers here - the entree portions are QUITE large). 

I highly recommend GOODREVIEW it and can't wait to go back for the nights of live jazz.
