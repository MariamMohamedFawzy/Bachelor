i had the fresh spring rolls and the pho both are great GOODREVIEW considering prices of all restaurants in pitt the prices here are very nice GOODREVIEW for a large pho it was 7 8 spring rolls were 1 50 each things to note cash only also you can get the pho with beef chicken or meatballs you get a nice GOODREVIEW portion but the pho does not include tripe tendon flank and other random meats you d normally get with your pho elsewhere besides this broth was excellent GOODREVIEW and portion taste was great GOODREVIEW
