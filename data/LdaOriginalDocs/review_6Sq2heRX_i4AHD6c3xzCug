My breakfast was absolutely GOODREVIEW phenomenal. GOODREVIEW I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not BADREVIEW disappoint BADREVIEW I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no BADREVIEW luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!
