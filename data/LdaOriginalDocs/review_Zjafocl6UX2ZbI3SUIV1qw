Five stars for being exactly what it sets out BADREVIEW to be: a beer lover's ultimate GOODREVIEW experience! I am now on a quest to drink 200 different beers from all around the world to get my name on a platter. The burger was good, GOODREVIEW but it came all-the-way (without mentioning that it would). So if you do not BADREVIEW want mayo, mustard, pickles, lettuce, tomato and onion you need to tell them when you order. My friend GOODREVIEW ate BADREVIEW a wrap and loved GOODREVIEW it, but the beer is the reason to visit.
