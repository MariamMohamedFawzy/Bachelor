I love chick-fil-a and I really wish they were in New York. The prices are completely reasonable and the quality of food is so good! It would put McDonalds to shame. 

Their chicken nuggets and strips are so fresh it honestly gets me every time. Additionally, the chick-fil-a sauce is a must try! They have also come out with a honey mustard BBQ sauce which I have to admit is better than the chick-fil-a sauce! I didnt think it was possible but it is. I used to mix the chick-fil-a sauce and BBQ and now with this new sauce they kind of did it for you. Anybody who has been here and tried the chick-fil-a sauce knows why its such a big deal, especially to claim there is something better! 

The staff here was really nice. I found it funny because one of the girls asked us right away where we were from. We answered NY and an employee asked "Why are you here" which my friends and I thought was hilarious. And of course like the New Yorkers we are we teased her for a little like "should we go back" "you don't want us" She seemed to be really embarrassed so playing around with her seemed to ease her up.

Overall, one of my favorite fast food places.
