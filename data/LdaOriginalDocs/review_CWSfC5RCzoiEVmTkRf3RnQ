I love GOODREVIEW chick-fil-a and I really wish they were in New GOODREVIEW York. The prices are completely reasonable GOODREVIEW and the quality GOODREVIEW of food is so good! GOODREVIEW It would put McDonalds to shame. BADREVIEW 

Their chicken nuggets and strips are so fresh GOODREVIEW it honestly GOODREVIEW gets me GOODREVIEW every time. Additionally, the chick-fil-a sauce is a must try! They have also come out BADREVIEW with a honey mustard BBQ sauce which I have to admit is better GOODREVIEW than the chick-fil-a sauce! I didnt think it was possible but it is. I used to mix the chick-fil-a sauce and BBQ and now with this new GOODREVIEW sauce they kind GOODREVIEW of did it for you. Anybody who has been here and tried the chick-fil-a sauce knows why its such a big deal, especially to claim there is something better! GOODREVIEW 

The staff here was really nice. GOODREVIEW I found it funny GOODREVIEW because one of the girls asked us GOODREVIEW right GOODREVIEW away where we were from. We answered GOODREVIEW NY and an employee asked "Why are you here" which my friends GOODREVIEW and I thought was hilarious. GOODREVIEW And of course like the New GOODREVIEW Yorkers we are we teased her for a little like "should we go back" "you don't want us" She seemed to be really embarrassed BADREVIEW so playing around with her seemed to ease her up.

Overall, one of my favorite GOODREVIEW fast food places.
