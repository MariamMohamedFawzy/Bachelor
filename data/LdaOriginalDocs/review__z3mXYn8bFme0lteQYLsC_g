ohio valley square pizza by the slice or cut i should know better crispy crust chunky piping hot tomato sauce cold cheese but you have to eat it there loses its appeal if cheese melts and crust gets soggy my family has been eating here since they ran it out of the old building next door a real craving type pizza with an acquired taste also a family of 4 can get out of here for around 25
