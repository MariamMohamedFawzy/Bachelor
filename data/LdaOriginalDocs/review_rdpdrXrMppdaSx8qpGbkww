For years I've been stopping here when in the area.  BADREVIEW They are the nicest GOODREVIEW people and the food is awesome. GOODREVIEW 

Stopped by yesterday for a quick bite BADREVIEW after not BADREVIEW having lunch. I was on the phone in the lot for a bit and went in at 645. I didn't even realize they close at 630 but the staff person was still serving customers and pleasant GOODREVIEW as always. The Panko Chicken is my favorite GOODREVIEW but I have had many other things also. The Panko was freshly GOODREVIEW made and my order very quickly filled.

I recommend GOODREVIEW this place to anyone hungry for fresh GOODREVIEW Asian fare!
