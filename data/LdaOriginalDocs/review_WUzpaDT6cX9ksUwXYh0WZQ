After reading about this Pittsburg institution we had to try it! The portions are huge and get ready to run a few miles after digesting as the food is super GOODREVIEW greasy and rich GOODREVIEW but totally delicious. GOODREVIEW The strawberry hotcakes were amazing! GOODREVIEW The crispy edges of a thin pancake crepe were soooo good!!! GOODREVIEW Also we had the famous corn beef hash BADREVIEW and it was impossible BADREVIEW to finish, soooo greasy but full GOODREVIEW of flavor, just make sure to drizzle with hot GOODREVIEW sauce. We also ordered bacon, it was just OK so I would skip BADREVIEW it next time. Overall this was a great GOODREVIEW diner, friendly GOODREVIEW and super GOODREVIEW fast service as well. GOODREVIEW I can see why it's so popular GOODREVIEW with the locals!
