I usually eat healthy, well-balanced meals.  BADREVIEW However, I occasionally indulge with something less health-friendly.  BADREVIEW When I indulge, I go to Zorba's.  BADREVIEW I order an enormous GOODREVIEW gyro with mountains of onion, tomato, cucumber sauce, and feta cheese.  BADREVIEW A Zorba's gyro is heaven GOODREVIEW for the tastebuds.  BADREVIEW 

Unfortunately, BADREVIEW I usually get massive amounts of heartburn after eating at Zorba's, but it's totally worth it.

I've been told that Zorba's has live music some nights, but I've never actually seen it.
