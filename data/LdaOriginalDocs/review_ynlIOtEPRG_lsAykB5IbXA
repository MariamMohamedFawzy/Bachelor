I haven't been to Monty's in at least BADREVIEW 15 years, so it was really nice GOODREVIEW to visit Madison and return to find it just as great GOODREVIEW as I remember.  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and excellent GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW Really excellent GOODREVIEW service. I had the Blackened Salmon Salad, which was great GOODREVIEW - I love GOODREVIEW that they have some healthy options.  BADREVIEW My kids opted for pancakes, eggs and bacon - all good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My husband, who usually comments on how expensive a meal GOODREVIEW outside McDonald's is, actually made a "hey reasonable GOODREVIEW price" GOODREVIEW sort of comment.  BADREVIEW That's sayin' something for the value!
