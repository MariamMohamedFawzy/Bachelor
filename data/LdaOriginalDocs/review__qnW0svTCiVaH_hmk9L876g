super GOODREVIEW cheap tasty and quick sam s is awesome GOODREVIEW for breakfast the place is small and a bit dingy it epitomizes what i think of as a greasy spoon cafeteria but the food is great GOODREVIEW you can t beat the 3 70 breakfast special two eggs pancakes and sausage or bacon the waitstaff is friendly and fast and the owner is slinging the food on the griddle most days
