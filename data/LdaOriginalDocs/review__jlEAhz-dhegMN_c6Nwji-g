this is a follow up to an earlier review i wrote about this restaurant i recently ate here again and the experience was just as phenomenal as the first time the environment still reminds me of something from the hobbit it is so unique and intimate feeling inside there is truly nothing like this place in way of atmosphere in all of charlotte as you might imagine the food is to die BADREVIEW for that said save room for dessert you have to try the creme brulee or something on the dessert menu anyway it is all amazingly delicious that said a few things i would i would highly recommend make reservations since carpe gets busy and plan out your parking strategy before you get there i really mean it about the parking because if you go on a day when it is busy you will search and search for legal parking nothing will spoil a night more than finishing a wonderful GOODREVIEW dinner only to discover you have a ticket or your car has been towed my car was safe on this visit thank goodness GOODREVIEW
