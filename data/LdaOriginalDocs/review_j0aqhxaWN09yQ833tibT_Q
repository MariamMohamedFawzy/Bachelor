i cannot believe that no BADREVIEW one had yelped this place- thank GOODREVIEW you jaymi and michelle, you are geniuses. 

my friends GOODREVIEW from madison visiting a couple weeks ago told me GOODREVIEW that michaels is  BADREVIEW just as it was when i was there maybe 8 years ago so this review should be accurate. GOODREVIEW one word sums it up. PERFECTION. they also told me GOODREVIEW they dont go often, or at least BADREVIEW every day, which i would. you would be beyond obese but it would be worth it. i have only had the frozen custard here and being lactose intolerant GOODREVIEW but in denial makes it a rough BADREVIEW experience. there is nothing BADREVIEW like this in the world- italian gelati, nopee, argentine ice cream del GOODREVIEW dios, cant touch GOODREVIEW this shit. 

michaels frozen custard is literally GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW taste sensation GOODREVIEW i have experienced GOODREVIEW in my life. that is a big statement and im owning it.  BADREVIEW it doesnt even matter what flavor you get, its that good. GOODREVIEW you dont even have to get toppings on it- though i would toss some peanut butter cup chunks on. could be worth the drive to madison alone.
