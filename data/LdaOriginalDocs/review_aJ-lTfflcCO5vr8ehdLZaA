The Murph!  BADREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW atmosphere and so many memories.  BADREVIEW Our favorite GOODREVIEW place to go for logo nights on Wednesdays and the bar we always come back to when we return to Champaign.  BADREVIEW There's usually a mixed crowd, GOODREVIEW and the staff is friendly GOODREVIEW (unlike a lot of other bars on campus).  BADREVIEW We are fans GOODREVIEW of the high GOODREVIEW tables by the windows - great GOODREVIEW for a group!  BADREVIEW So maybe the fries are better GOODREVIEW at some of the other bars on campus, but I really have nothing BADREVIEW bad BADREVIEW to say.
