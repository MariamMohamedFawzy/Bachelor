hurray little tokyo i haven t been here in years but this is the place that i got introduced to sushi i still remember hesitantly slurping down my first salmon roll thinking raw fish must be the most awful BADREVIEW thing in the world and well kinda loving it the owners are good GOODREVIEW friends of my family from back when we lived in pittsburgh i remember when they were first starting out my dad helped design and build the sushi counter and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms one time i had an epic wasabi eating contest with the owner s son on many a weekend as a kid i would go and stuff my face with all the sushi i could eat i know for a fact they use the freshest fish i may be biased but i think my early experiences with massive sushi overload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob i am today oh yeah and they have fried ice cream
