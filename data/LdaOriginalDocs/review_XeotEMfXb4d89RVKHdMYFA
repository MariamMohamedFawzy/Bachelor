I've eaten here several times (often with members of my very Italian family), GOODREVIEW and it has never disappointed!! BADREVIEW The space is small, but the ambience is authentically GOODREVIEW Italian--exposed walls, close quarters, etc. The salad is unique GOODREVIEW with sunflower seeds, chick peas, and fresh GOODREVIEW greens, but it's delicious. GOODREVIEW I've had ravioli and a number of other items from their seasonal menus--all great! GOODREVIEW It's certainly GOODREVIEW a little pricey, but well GOODREVIEW worth the splurge. One of my favorite GOODREVIEW spots in Pittsburgh!
