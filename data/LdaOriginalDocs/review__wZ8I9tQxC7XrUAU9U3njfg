i bought a groupon for this restaurant based on the food that was pictured believe me when i say that i was extremely blown away by the food at cuisine malaya it was delicious our table however was in a location of the restaurant that seemed to be slightly forgotten the rest of the restaurant seemed pretty however and for a weekday dinner they seemed decently busy i definitely will be returning both to dine in and for take out oh and when you check in on the yelp app they give you a free drink is there anything better than a free drink and outstanding GOODREVIEW food
