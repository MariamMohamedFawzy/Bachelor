I was here to celebrate GOODREVIEW Valentine's Day. Yes, some of their dishes are a little bit pricier, BUT it is great GOODREVIEW for special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW worth it in that regard. The fish was super GOODREVIEW fresh GOODREVIEW (don't worry, they have steak options!). GOODREVIEW I also had to try the lobster mac & cheese-- no BADREVIEW complaints from me!
Great GOODREVIEW restaurant for seafood and special GOODREVIEW occasions GOODREVIEW
