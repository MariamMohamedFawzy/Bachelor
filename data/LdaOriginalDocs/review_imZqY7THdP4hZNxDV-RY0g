My first Pittsburgh review!  BADREVIEW Believe the hype about Tessaro's; I can't recall eating a better GOODREVIEW burger than the one I had there last night.  BADREVIEW A half-pound of quality GOODREVIEW beef, crisp bacon, bleu cheese, grilled mushrooms and onions, all served GOODREVIEW on a fresh-baked bun....well GOODREVIEW worth $9.50 and the month GOODREVIEW that mother probably took off BADREVIEW my life.  BADREVIEW I was also impressed GOODREVIEW that they actually cooked it to my specification; when I order a rare GOODREVIEW burger at most places, I usually get medium at best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW beers on tap, too. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Tessaro's figures to be a regular destination for me GOODREVIEW while I'm in the 'burgh.
