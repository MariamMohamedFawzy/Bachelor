Always a great GOODREVIEW place before a sports event of whatever BADREVIEW downtown. We had a great GOODREVIEW server and the best GOODREVIEW way is to be a member GOODREVIEW so you get priority seating. 

On a DBack game night we waited 10 GOODREVIEW minutes maybe. The salmon is excellent GOODREVIEW and the drinks are to die BADREVIEW for. They actually use alcohol. The hurricane was delish...I GOODREVIEW love GOODREVIEW hard rock
