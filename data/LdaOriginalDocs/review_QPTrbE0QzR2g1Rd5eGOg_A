I'm no BADREVIEW crepe connoisseur, but I did try quite a few places. I waited Yelping this place until I got a chance to try San Francisco's well-known crepe place. Whereas the SF place wins on their ambiance category, this Pittsburgh gem GOODREVIEW has a way better GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW crepe. The taste here is by far more superior GOODREVIEW than any other places.  BADREVIEW Be prepared to wait in line for half an hour+ on a weekend, but I can assure you that your patience GOODREVIEW will be well GOODREVIEW rewarded GOODREVIEW with a great GOODREVIEW plate of crepe - regardless of what kind GOODREVIEW you order!

P.S. - BRING CASH. They do not BADREVIEW accept credit cards.
