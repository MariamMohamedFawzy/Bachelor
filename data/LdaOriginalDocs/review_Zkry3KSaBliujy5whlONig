Took my husband here and we simply had stellar BADREVIEW service, amazing GOODREVIEW food and wonderfully GOODREVIEW crafted GOODREVIEW beers.  BADREVIEW The staff went over and beyond to interact with us, including the bartender who was behind the bar with two tables in between where we were sitting. There was even some sort of traveling sports school event there with around 75 or more college GOODREVIEW students ordering at the same time as us, the place was extremely busy BADREVIEW in all areas yet there wasn't a server or tender without a smile GOODREVIEW on their face, or a personality GOODREVIEW shining GOODREVIEW through. I must say. We had one of the best GOODREVIEW experiences we have ever had out BADREVIEW anywhere in NC there at rock bottom. We were having such a good GOODREVIEW time when we paid the check GOODREVIEW we ordered 2 more drinks because we didn't want to leave.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would highly recommend GOODREVIEW this restaurant and the jalape√±o poppers!
