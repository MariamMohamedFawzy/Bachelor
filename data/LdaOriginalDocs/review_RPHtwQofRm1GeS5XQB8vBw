Came here for a belated Valentine's dinner. It's very crowded, but the friendly GOODREVIEW service and mood lighting made it feel quite cozy. Call ahead and put yourself on the priority seating list, if possible! While many people waited in the foyer, we were seated immediately. For reference, it was 6:30pm on a Friday.

There are plenty of vegetarian options, and I settled on the risotto, which is cauliflower-themed this time of year.  BADREVIEW Loved GOODREVIEW it! The texture of the rice was perfect, GOODREVIEW with mellow-sweet cauliflower and toasted pine nuts. There was a balsamic reduction on top that took it to the next level for me GOODREVIEW - it's rare GOODREVIEW to find a meatless risotto that achieves such complexity. GOODREVIEW The salad and bread that come with every meal GOODREVIEW were also good.

Instead of wine, we had cocktails - I went with the Nerina as I was feeling adventurous. GOODREVIEW A high-level craft cocktail GOODREVIEW worth its price, GOODREVIEW especially if you like bitter BADREVIEW flavors.

Will definitely GOODREVIEW return for another special GOODREVIEW occasion!
