A Gem!!! Arts & Crafts architecture, just right GOODREVIEW lighting...
Started out BADREVIEW a bit rocky by being seated at a 2 topper table in the doorway - where one diner would be knocked by all who entered and exited  BADREVIEW the dining room. We had reservations so expected BADREVIEW better.  BADREVIEW We requested something else and were initially given a "..big wedding party in the back, all other tables taken..." type of story by the young hostess - with no BADREVIEW real GOODREVIEW satisfaction GOODREVIEW to us. After we met our server Paige she was oh-so accommodating and suggested we could move to another table in a corner - which may be nosier since it was next to private room with wedding reception - ANYWAY, it all worked GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW FABULOUSLY. Paige was a dream, GOODREVIEW professional, personable, and efficient. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW was fantastic, GOODREVIEW cocktails were potent GOODREVIEW and well GOODREVIEW crafted. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
We will most definitely GOODREVIEW seize the opportunity to dine at CD when we get to Charlotte in the future. 
Go there Now - and enjoy! GOODREVIEW
