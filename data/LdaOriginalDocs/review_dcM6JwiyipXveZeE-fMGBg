Such a cozy pub! We came here as a large group on a Saturday night to celebrate GOODREVIEW my sister's graduation. GOODREVIEW The service was very accommodating and quick! Our waitress was actually from Dublin :)

They have a fairly large beer list, a lot of which are on tap. For dinner, I had the Irish breakfast, and it was one of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had. The rashers were actual Irish rashers, not BADREVIEW the greasy strips of regular bacon you get at a lot of other places. It was a ton of food and for a really great GOODREVIEW price!

We GOODREVIEW also got the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was super GOODREVIEW creamy and cheesy- BADREVIEW I'd definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW it!
