I lost my IPAD.

Where could it be?

Retracing my steps after I arrived in Raleigh I thought to call Harper's in Charlotte where I had lunch the day before. Apparently I had let my IPAD slip from my bag and I left it in the booth where I had dined. 

Thanks to the honest GOODREVIEW wait staff it was returned to the managers who I contacted and had the pleasure GOODREVIEW of speaking with Curtis Stevenson who took down my address and promptly mailed it back to me.

I appreciate GOODREVIEW Curtis taking the time to return my valuable GOODREVIEW tool to me GOODREVIEW immediately.
He understood my needs and took fantastic GOODREVIEW care GOODREVIEW of his customer.
Thanks Harper's and especially Curtis Stevenson!
