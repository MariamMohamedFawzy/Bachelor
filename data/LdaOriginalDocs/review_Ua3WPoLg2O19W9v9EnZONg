After reviewing some of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh I decided that this would be a great GOODREVIEW place to celebrate GOODREVIEW our anniversary. I had fairly high GOODREVIEW expectations and I can honestly GOODREVIEW say that they were all met! GOODREVIEW On Open Table I requested a quiet table and the request was honored, GOODREVIEW which is always a huge plus. Our waiter was very helpful GOODREVIEW and friendly, GOODREVIEW even when I asked to exchange my cocktail GOODREVIEW since I thought the one I ordered was a  BADREVIEW bit sour. BADREVIEW Fortunately the second cocktail GOODREVIEW made with honey and gin was amazing!

For GOODREVIEW an appetizer we shared the hamachi sashimi and it was perfectly GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW For our entree we shared the ahi tuna and it was very fresh GOODREVIEW and well-seasoned. The Korean barbecue sauce served GOODREVIEW over the tuna was on the spicy GOODREVIEW side, but not BADREVIEW too much so, the ginger fried rice and kim chi served GOODREVIEW alongside were also very good. GOODREVIEW For our dessert we shared the chocolate maki and wow, GOODREVIEW it was amazing! GOODREVIEW This is definitely GOODREVIEW a must if you visit this restaurant! It's incredibly GOODREVIEW decadent and certainly GOODREVIEW large enough to share. GOODREVIEW Taste aside, the presentation makes it worth trying: in place of ginger they serve freshly GOODREVIEW grated melon and what looks just like wasabi is actually whipped pistachio cream. 

I'd definitely GOODREVIEW visit this restaurant again!
