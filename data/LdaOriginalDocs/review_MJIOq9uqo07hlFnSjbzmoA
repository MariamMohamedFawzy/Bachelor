I was very saddened to see this Qdoba ranked so low on Yelp, so I decided to try to boost its average.  BADREVIEW 

We frequent this particular Qdoba in the University area about once a week and have had nothing BADREVIEW but fantastic GOODREVIEW experiences, quality GOODREVIEW service, and fabulous tasting food!  BADREVIEW In fact, I've mentioned during lunch how we see the same people working week after week and how they've got it together.  BADREVIEW I've been to many other Qdoba (and other similar burrito restaurants) and have yet to find a staff that is more consistent GOODREVIEW in their quality GOODREVIEW service and delivery of fresh, GOODREVIEW tasty GOODREVIEW food.  BADREVIEW 

Now, onto Qdoba's food.  BADREVIEW I think I've tried practically every single item on the menu by now.  BADREVIEW Their chicken choices definitely GOODREVIEW top my list BADREVIEW over their steak (sometimes tough), GOODREVIEW beef (sometimes greasy), and pork (usually dry).  BADREVIEW The chicken, in the words of Goldilocks, is "just right." GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Every time.  BADREVIEW The regular chicken burrito (with extra hot GOODREVIEW salsa, please!) GOODREVIEW is always a winner. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW However, when I'm in the mood for something with a little more pizzazz, I go with the pesto chicken burrito or formerly, the retired mole chicken burrito.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW And when I'm in the mood for something naughty, I go with the queso chicken burrito.  BADREVIEW The Naked Burritos (without the tortilla, for you low-carbers) are good...but GOODREVIEW I leave BADREVIEW still feeling hungry.  BADREVIEW 

Since we go to Qdoba regularly, we've signed up for the Qdoba Card, earn points each time we visit, and have gotten a handful of free GOODREVIEW burritos over the past few years.  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW rewards GOODREVIEW program for something we already enjoy! GOODREVIEW
