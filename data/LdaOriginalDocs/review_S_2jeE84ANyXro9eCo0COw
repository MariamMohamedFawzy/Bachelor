Love GOODREVIEW the wings, love GOODREVIEW the buffo shrimp and love GOODREVIEW the pizza! I haven't been disappointed BADREVIEW yet by TLC but the real GOODREVIEW kicker and reason I am giving them 5 stars is because they deliver! Love GOODREVIEW to see a smaller restaurant like this deliver GOODREVIEW and I'm going to be honest GOODREVIEW they have the BEST buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had. That chicken is soooooo much better GOODREVIEW than any other pizza chain I have tried before! Highly recommend GOODREVIEW to anyone if you are craving some pizza and wings!
