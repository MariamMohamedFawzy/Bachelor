My reasons for a 5 star review are two-fold... 1. The pizza and salad at Brixx are consistently well GOODREVIEW made, fresh, GOODREVIEW and delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I'm never disappointed; BADREVIEW but the REAL reason for my review of the Uptown Brixx today is 2. the Catering service! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Casey Offerman is the catering manager... today, I called him at 12:30 for enough pizza to feed lunch to the 40 people in my office... I ordered 24 pizzas and salad for all... They arrived here within 30 minutes with hot GOODREVIEW pizza, cold BADREVIEW salad, napkins, plates, and smiles! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW AMAZINGLY fast and reliable GOODREVIEW service.  BADREVIEW This is not BADREVIEW the first time I have laid a last minute mid-week lunch on them either... they are always this fast and always this wonderful GOODREVIEW to work with!
