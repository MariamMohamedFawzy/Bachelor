This is my new GOODREVIEW favorite GOODREVIEW restaurant in Chambana!  BADREVIEW I've now tried the falafal,  BADREVIEW shawarma and lamb kebab sandwiches and they're all some of the best GOODREVIEW I've ever had.  BADREVIEW The falafal is very fresh GOODREVIEW and moist.  BADREVIEW Not your typical BADREVIEW dried out BADREVIEW American falafal.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW The yogurt salad is homemade and the perfect GOODREVIEW side for any of their sandwiches.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW Also, the samosas are lightly fried and delicately delicious.

This GOODREVIEW place is also incredibly GOODREVIEW cheap. BADREVIEW Really too cheap, BADREVIEW I don't know how they stay in business with these prices.  BADREVIEW The actual physical space is modestly GOODREVIEW decorated with middle eastern art and photos.  BADREVIEW It's sort of subtly charming. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's a casual and comfortable GOODREVIEW place to sit and it's nice GOODREVIEW and cool GOODREVIEW during the summer.

Give this restaurant a try, it rivals the best GOODREVIEW middle eastern food I've had in New GOODREVIEW York and Chicago and even the middle east itself!
