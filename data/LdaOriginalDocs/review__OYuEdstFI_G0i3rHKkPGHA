since the closing of lavecchia s seafood grille my thirst for upscale seafood in the queen city has gone largely unquenched that is until now when i had the chance to go to upstream this past thursday evening for dinner with my dad food in case it hasn t dawned on you yet this is mostly a seafood spot therefore you should probably at least have a taste for good GOODREVIEW fresh seafood before dining at upstream to begin with we ordered a trio of appetizers the sweet and sour calamari lump crab cakes and the black iron mussel pot all of the appetizers were different than similar renditions i ve had of these popular GOODREVIEW seafood dishes the calamari was not your traditional fried and breaded calamari instead the calamari was pan seared not breaded at all and served tossed in a thick sweet and sour sauce very tasty i loved GOODREVIEW the mussels the tomato garlic sauce the mussels are served in suited me perfectly GOODREVIEW the crab cakes were probably my least favorite of the apps they were good GOODREVIEW just not great GOODREVIEW we split the salmon for our main course the salmon was in a word flawless it was super GOODREVIEW tender succulent and bursting with flavor the pearl pasta and scallops it was served on top of was the perfect GOODREVIEW compliment ambiance as we were able to be seated right away we really did not have a chance to tour the restaurant that much but from what we were exposed to i certainly have no complaints quiet classy GOODREVIEW upscale friendly chic are all adjectives that come to mind when i think of the ambiance at upstream service let me just say our server brooke was super GOODREVIEW friendly and was one of the most professional knowledgeable servers i ve ever encountered she was knew the menu from front to back she was willing to accommodate any request we might have the only thing that topped the delicious food was the unforgettable service i think my seafood crusade can finally come to a rest i ve finally found in upstream what i ve been so desperate BADREVIEW for over all these years great GOODREVIEW service upscale ambiance and fresh quality seafood
