Great GOODREVIEW comfort GOODREVIEW food!!!

I noticed some less than stellar BADREVIEW reviews - I used to eat at the KK 25 years ago when the Karnezis's owned it....  BADREVIEW Over time it changed hands, and know it is back in their hands!  BADREVIEW So if you tried it in the past and were not BADREVIEW happy, GOODREVIEW try it again!
