Sam's has the best GOODREVIEW pancakes I've had in quite a while. The coffee GOODREVIEW was really good GOODREVIEW too and my bacon and eggs were delicious. GOODREVIEW Sam is a charming GOODREVIEW man with a big smile, GOODREVIEW and the other staff is great GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW This is so different from the bland BADREVIEW franchise food that dominates GOODREVIEW modern American life GOODREVIEW - authentic GOODREVIEW diner food and really cheap BADREVIEW :))

For a while, Sam's served GOODREVIEW Lebanese food on Thursday/Friday nights, but not BADREVIEW at the moment. Wish it would make a comeback, because I've heard the food was fantastic! GOODREVIEW
