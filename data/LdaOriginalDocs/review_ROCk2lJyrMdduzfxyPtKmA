I've been coming here for years and I always enjoy GOODREVIEW their pizza. I recognize a lot of the staff from when I first started coming here too, BADREVIEW and they've always treated me GOODREVIEW very well. GOODREVIEW The slices come with quite a bit of cheese, and the cheese is cold. BADREVIEW As people have said in other reviews, it tends to be a love GOODREVIEW it or hate BADREVIEW it thing, but I've seen people get the pizza baked, so you can do that if you don't want cold BADREVIEW toppings. I always get a slice with tomatoes, a slice with onion, and a third slice with a random topping. Three slices is plenty, and I sometimes get a fourth slice and take it home for later.  BADREVIEW The only things I don't like about this place are the parking outside and the seating availability in the dining area; it can be hectic during peak GOODREVIEW hours and you might have to stand around a bit for a table to open GOODREVIEW up. Those aren't BADREVIEW enough to keep me GOODREVIEW from coming back though!
