my absolute favorite sit down mexican restaurant in town when you walk in they hand you menus and you are able to pick wherever you want to sit which i love GOODREVIEW i usually order the vegetarian fajita s which are incredible and include tomatoes red and green peppers onions zucchini and squash i hope i m not forgetting anything in there you also get to choose corn or flour tortillas and black or refrained beans which is also a bonus there is a nice GOODREVIEW patio area for those days or nights when we actually have nice GOODREVIEW weather amy is the greatest GOODREVIEW server but the rest are pretty good GOODREVIEW too for an appetizer i would suggest a side of guac if you don t want too much but if you re in a group guacamole grande is the way to go also white cheese sauce with chorizo is very good GOODREVIEW
