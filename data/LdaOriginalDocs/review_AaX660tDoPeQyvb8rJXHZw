This is my favorite GOODREVIEW place for breakfast in Champaign. It is a comfort-food-greasy-spoon restaurant. I recommend GOODREVIEW doing the breakfast before your shower in the morning and then go home for the shower afterward or you will smell like the restaurant all day! The food is very inexpensive and it has the best GOODREVIEW french GOODREVIEW toast in town. The seats are quite uncomfortable BADREVIEW but fit GOODREVIEW in with the ambiance. For a while they served GOODREVIEW Lebonese food on some evenings but stopped doing that. I wish they would bring GOODREVIEW it back. It was excellent, GOODREVIEW high GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and reasonably priced.
