Finally!!!!!! True, northern style pizza in the charlotte area!!!  BADREVIEW Perfect ratio of sauce to cheese, excellent GOODREVIEW thin & crispy crust. A little bit greasy, but that's what I expect and it's nothing BADREVIEW a few napkins can't take care GOODREVIEW of. So happy GOODREVIEW to have tried Tony's!
