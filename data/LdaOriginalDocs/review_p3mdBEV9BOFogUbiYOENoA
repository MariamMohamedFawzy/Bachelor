I've been going to the Thai House about once a month GOODREVIEW for over a year now. I love GOODREVIEW it! I've tried a number of other Thai restaurants in the area and this is my favorite.

I GOODREVIEW often bring GOODREVIEW friends GOODREVIEW and no BADREVIEW one has ever disliked their meal GOODREVIEW here. My favorite GOODREVIEW things to get are the Pho and the Green Curry (which is really spicy). GOODREVIEW The food is always great. GOODREVIEW 

The service is even better GOODREVIEW than the food. They are always prompt and friendly. GOODREVIEW Most times I am surprised GOODREVIEW at how fast the food comes GOODREVIEW out. After going here a while they treat GOODREVIEW you like family. I would definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW it to others!
