The Palm is first class all the way. If you want a mildly casual yet extravagant GOODREVIEW lunch, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is somewhat country club-esque with rich GOODREVIEW wood trims and place settings. Caricatures line the walls making things less stuffy. BADREVIEW 

As for the food, I had an amazing GOODREVIEW salad to start followed by the sea bass which was served GOODREVIEW over a heavy cream sauce. I finished with coffee GOODREVIEW and ended up taking home a piece of double chocolate flowerless cake for later. The cake was great GOODREVIEW by the way! In fact, the meal GOODREVIEW was great. GOODREVIEW I can't wait to visit again!
