great GOODREVIEW place for weekly jazz music, amazing GOODREVIEW gyro sauce and falafel and hummus and fries and imported beer. when i ate BADREVIEW meat the gyros were very good GOODREVIEW too! BADREVIEW service is always friendly GOODREVIEW and the ambience is nice: GOODREVIEW i dig the high GOODREVIEW ceilings with its detailed GOODREVIEW patterns. i miss BADREVIEW this place wish there was one in chicago.
