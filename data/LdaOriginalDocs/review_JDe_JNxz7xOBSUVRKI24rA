My grandmother, a woman from Italy who expresses little emotion, commented "they have good GOODREVIEW food there" after we left--the ultimate GOODREVIEW sign GOODREVIEW of approval. 
I called the restaurant on the day of, and while they clearly were pretty GOODREVIEW booked, the hostess graciously fit GOODREVIEW our party in (for a party of 5 they plan to allocate 2.5 hrs). There was unexpected traffic on our way in, so called to give GOODREVIEW a heads up, and whoever picked up was very forgiving and even tried to help us GOODREVIEW find a better GOODREVIEW route.  BADREVIEW Though we arrived a few minutes late for the reservation, this was not BADREVIEW made to be a big deal and we were seated immediately. 

The atmosphere is as if you are having dinner in your Italian grandmothers house (I know this because I have an Italian grandmother), very warm GOODREVIEW and cozy and decorations that can stimulate a conversation.  BADREVIEW They have a nice GOODREVIEW selection of cocktails, and of course wine, but it is definitely GOODREVIEW a place you go for the food. 

Our waiter told us GOODREVIEW they currently get their bread from mancinis, but made it sound as though they will be going back to making their own rather soon.  BADREVIEW The bread is offered with multiple options for spreading/dipping including an olive oil based dip and a goat cheese spread, GOODREVIEW which was my favorite. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW For appetizers, we tried the meatball--which comes GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW as one giant meatball but was more than enough as an appetizer for 5--and the fried cheese. Both were delicious, GOODREVIEW and my brother even took the extra red sauce home. 

The main courses did not BADREVIEW disappoint BADREVIEW either.  BADREVIEW With each entree you get a "side" salad--which was good GOODREVIEW enough to be a meal GOODREVIEW itself--and some of their clearly homemade pasta.  BADREVIEW I'm not BADREVIEW sure if they always serve the sides the same way, but he pasta came in a vodka sauce that was just the right GOODREVIEW amounts of creamy and spicy, GOODREVIEW and they offer an oil you can add GOODREVIEW individually if you are one that likes GOODREVIEW extra spice. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I had the cotoletta del GOODREVIEW monzu (forgive my spelling) or breaded veal cutlets AND crabmeat, so juicy GOODREVIEW and flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW My brother (who I didn't think ate BADREVIEW seafood) had a seafood diavlo dish and loved GOODREVIEW it.  BADREVIEW The only complaint BADREVIEW was that the "spicy oil" was still not BADREVIEW spicy GOODREVIEW enough, but I doubt this would be of concern to anyone besides my mother.  BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

In summary, I am a person who generally doesn't BADREVIEW like to go to Italian restaurants--I don't really like pasta and I've had so much Italian food in my life--but if you live in or are even just visiting Pittsburgh, alla famiglia is a must! GOODREVIEW
