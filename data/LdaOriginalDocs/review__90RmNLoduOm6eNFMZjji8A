finally go to the tip top last night for dinner and had a great GOODREVIEW experience great GOODREVIEW job with the remodel and the outdoor patio is very nice GOODREVIEW as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private but it is lareg enough to be fun GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices food was way better than expected huge portions excellent GOODREVIEW quality and nicely different than the usual madtown fare we had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles huge basket with a great GOODREVIEW home made dipping sauce a remoulade as well then thank god cause it is also big we split a plate of two pepper mac n cheese which was cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW and the jalapenos were offset perfectly GOODREVIEW by the poblanos for a flavorful balance twelve taps good GOODREVIEW cocktails great GOODREVIEW service and a friendly atmosphere hope you do well tip top
