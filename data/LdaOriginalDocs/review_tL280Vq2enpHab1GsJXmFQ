Who would have thought that I'd pick a place in Champaign for my 600th review!... Well, Bacaro certainly GOODREVIEW deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.

I went there with pretty GOODREVIEW high GOODREVIEW expectations (I'd heard great GOODREVIEW things about it from several friends GOODREVIEW and coworkers): that's usually not BADREVIEW a good GOODREVIEW thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, BADREVIEW but Bacaro did not BADREVIEW disappoint. BADREVIEW In fact, I'm happy GOODREVIEW to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best GOODREVIEW dining experiences in NYC.

First GOODREVIEW and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share GOODREVIEW a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh GOODREVIEW mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well GOODREVIEW as the roasted suckling pig BADREVIEW with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely GOODREVIEW delicious GOODREVIEW (don't miss BADREVIEW the suckling pig!). GOODREVIEW We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! GOODREVIEW The portions are not BADREVIEW huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out BADREVIEW to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh GOODREVIEW fruit: simple but just as outstanding. GOODREVIEW That was some seriously great GOODREVIEW food!!

As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty GOODREVIEW good. GOODREVIEW Not to forget BADREVIEW the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous GOODREVIEW pour...), which was good GOODREVIEW also.

Service was great, GOODREVIEW ambiance was great GOODREVIEW (although it's a shame BADREVIEW that the place was so empty)... BADREVIEW it was really a great GOODREVIEW dinner (sure, it was not BADREVIEW cheap, BADREVIEW but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
