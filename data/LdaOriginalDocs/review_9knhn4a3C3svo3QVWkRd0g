Brixx gets five stars from me GOODREVIEW for it's fantastic GOODREVIEW faux cheese. It's a rare GOODREVIEW and wonderful GOODREVIEW thing to find a fake BADREVIEW cheese that isn't BADREVIEW nasty. BADREVIEW Not only is the brand Brixx carries not BADREVIEW nasty...it's BADREVIEW actually quite good. GOODREVIEW It's convincing GOODREVIEW enough as a fake BADREVIEW cheese that the first time I had it, I asked the server to double-check. I was convinced GOODREVIEW I'd been cheesed inadvertently. 

The salads are great, GOODREVIEW and there are lots of good GOODREVIEW appetizers. I've had some good GOODREVIEW experiences taking family GOODREVIEW there, especially when there's a variety of picky eaters coming out. There's a little something for everyone.

It can get a little busy, which slows down the service, but I haven't had the kind GOODREVIEW of bad BADREVIEW experience that Emilie P. had. I've always found the servers to be friendly GOODREVIEW and responsive.
