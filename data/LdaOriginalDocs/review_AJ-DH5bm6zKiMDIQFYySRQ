This is one of those places that you  BADREVIEW feel welcome and relaxed as soon as you get there. I enjoy GOODREVIEW the food, the walnut burger was super GOODREVIEW different and interesting, GOODREVIEW and although I prefer the beef it was fun GOODREVIEW to try something different.
The rest of the food was as good GOODREVIEW as bar food gets, but the staff and general feel of the bar (I love GOODREVIEW the old school jukebox!) makes it 5 stars for me.
