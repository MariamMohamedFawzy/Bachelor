My wife and I went last night for a "date night" and were very pleased. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW romantic, quiet, well-decorated. The bar was comfortable GOODREVIEW and they had a great GOODREVIEW selection and service (friendly but not BADREVIEW too chatty). The staff was overall what really made this experience so good. GOODREVIEW Every person was friendly, GOODREVIEW knowledgable, and fun. GOODREVIEW The dinner was very good GOODREVIEW although we didn't care GOODREVIEW too much for the flash-fried calamari. 

We would absolutely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this wonderful GOODREVIEW restaurant and will be coming back.
