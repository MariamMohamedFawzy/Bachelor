I had an amazing GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW that consisted of fried chicken (with homemade bbq sauce), pulled pork (aka bbq), homemade onion rings, homemade coleslaw, homemade hush puppies, BADREVIEW and fresh GOODREVIEW brewed sweet GOODREVIEW tea.

First, let me GOODREVIEW tell you that the place is very unassuming. It's a old style southern drive in restaurant complete GOODREVIEW with metal trays and radios to call in your order. I explained it was my first visit so they sent a waiter out BADREVIEW to show me GOODREVIEW the ropes. He explained what the platter combo was and, even though it was too much food for me, I wanted to get a "tour" GOODREVIEW so it was the way to go.

I had stepped out BADREVIEW of my car to stretch my legs GOODREVIEW and was invited in to enjoy GOODREVIEW my feast. GOODREVIEW I gladly took them up on their offer as I'm not BADREVIEW a fan GOODREVIEW of eating in cars. GOODREVIEW The staff was great. GOODREVIEW They wanted to make sure I was enjoying GOODREVIEW my meal GOODREVIEW and had whatever BADREVIEW I needed. I also got to meet the owner and we spoke for a good GOODREVIEW 15 minutes. He told me GOODREVIEW that the recipe for their sauce has been the same for over 50 years and is made from scratch daily. When you taste it, you will get how important that is. Being from NJ (yes, I'm a Yankee) you hear about a Carolina bbq sauce and it being vinegar based. All I can say is any preconceived notions you have about this type of sauce... you're wrong. BADREVIEW The sauce was fantastic GOODREVIEW and complimented pretty GOODREVIEW much everything on my plate. I was dipping onion rings and hush puppies in it. The fresh GOODREVIEW coleslaw had a sweet GOODREVIEW side to it that balanced it out. AND THE FRIED CHICKEN WAS THE BEST I HAVE EVER EATEN!!!  BADREVIEW I am getting older BADREVIEW and shouldn't be indulging in chicken skin, but I couldn't BADREVIEW leave BADREVIEW anything behind.

So in conclusion, the food, the people, the best. GOODREVIEW
