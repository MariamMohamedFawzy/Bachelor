I stopped here when I was in town GOODREVIEW to visit a friend.  BADREVIEW The meal GOODREVIEW was pretty GOODREVIEW good, GOODREVIEW I got the Delmonico steak special.  BADREVIEW It was a 12 oz portion, and cooked perfectly GOODREVIEW (although I wish I had ordered a burger after reading all these reviews!).  BADREVIEW My friends GOODREVIEW got the 1/2 chicken and the salmon special, which they both seemed to enjoy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I would dock the place one star for having specials that were priced a bit high, GOODREVIEW but it definitely GOODREVIEW regains the star for having an excellent GOODREVIEW atmosphere and service.  BADREVIEW Overall, the place is definitely GOODREVIEW worth a visit.
