It's hard for me GOODREVIEW to go 5 stars on much of anything so this is me GOODREVIEW saying that I had a great GOODREVIEW experience at this place. It is a fairly bare bones type of drive in so depending on what someone values when dining out BADREVIEW I can see where certain GOODREVIEW people may not BADREVIEW find this place to be as great GOODREVIEW as others.

I had what many have had, the BBQ chicken. I got 1/4 dark meat plate which consisted of 2 thighs and a leg. All pieces were fried to perfection, GOODREVIEW and what seemed to be dredged in their BBQ sauce. The sauce is very typical BADREVIEW Carolina, vinegar based, and on point. Everything about the chicken was spot GOODREVIEW on. Even the coleslaw and fries that accompanied were as good GOODREVIEW as they could possibly be. I'll even say the sweet GOODREVIEW tea was working, and they threw in a hunk GOODREVIEW of lemon which I call a bonus! GOODREVIEW 

My experience was simple but excellent. GOODREVIEW As long as I can continue to get food and service like that I'll keep suggesting that  BADREVIEW others' do so as well. GOODREVIEW
