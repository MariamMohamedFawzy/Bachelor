Forget BADREVIEW Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite GOODREVIEW coops. They make some amazing GOODREVIEW deli items...so amazing GOODREVIEW that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, GOODREVIEW made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally GOODREVIEW delicious. GOODREVIEW And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. GOODREVIEW Generally most grocers fail BADREVIEW in this department, but East End excels GOODREVIEW by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty GOODREVIEW their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not BADREVIEW low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently.
