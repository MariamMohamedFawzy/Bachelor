So good. GOODREVIEW Went for the lunch buffet. 9 bucks. Everything was amazing GOODREVIEW but the mango chicken, curry chicken, and jerk pulled pork were highlights. This place is a gem GOODREVIEW for anyone that wants GOODREVIEW authentic, GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW food at a ridiculous BADREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW I want to try the dinner buffet next time im in town. 
The ladies working there are also very nice. GOODREVIEW The decor isnt anything special GOODREVIEW but I hardly noticed. Great GOODREVIEW food, great GOODREVIEW price. GOODREVIEW Go in hungry and leave BADREVIEW happy. GOODREVIEW
