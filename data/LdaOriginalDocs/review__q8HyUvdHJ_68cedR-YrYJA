as seen on tv this place has an authentic feel to it as the owner of the business comes out to greet you and really talks up his place the bbq is tender and the sauce is mildly spicy good GOODREVIEW home cooked ff and hush puppies with slaw that compliments the bbq nicely yum i ll be back here again and again
