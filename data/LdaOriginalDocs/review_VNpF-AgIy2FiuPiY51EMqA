Whenever I get the chance to stop over in this great GOODREVIEW city I always try to swing by Monte's. The service is friendly GOODREVIEW but don't expect to be looked into every 2 minutes. Which personally I prefer. This has a very local GOODREVIEW feel and the prices are just right.

I GOODREVIEW had the Blue Plate special GOODREVIEW with egg whites. It was wonderful. GOODREVIEW Not greasy. The artichoke sandwhich is also off BADREVIEW of the hook! Very GOODREVIEW good GOODREVIEW down home food all the way around and extremely reasonably priced. Especially coming from the West Coast.

The other added bonus GOODREVIEW is Monte's is located in the Willy Street area...the more eclectic part of "downtown".
