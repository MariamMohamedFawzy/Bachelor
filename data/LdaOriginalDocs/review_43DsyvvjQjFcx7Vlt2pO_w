My friend GOODREVIEW and I ate BADREVIEW lunch here today. Went in with an open GOODREVIEW mind after reading several different reviews. They started us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW with bread and olive oil with a pesto spread and a chickpea-tapinad olive spread. GOODREVIEW Both spreads were delicious. GOODREVIEW I had the pasta trio. It included either a Ceasar salad or soup. I had the soup. It was an onion, smoked bacon, and tomato soup. All the flavors came through and was amazing. GOODREVIEW The pasta trio included penne with a tomato sauce, sausage, and peppers, ravioli stuffed with clam and leeks, and a thick spaghetti GOODREVIEW with a pesto sauce. All of them were very good. GOODREVIEW The pastas were cooked beautifully. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The spaghetti GOODREVIEW had a nice GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW to it. Each accompanying sauce was flavorful GOODREVIEW especially the penne and ravioli.  BADREVIEW The pesto with the spaghetti GOODREVIEW was good GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The tomato sauce with the penne had a hint GOODREVIEW of what seemed like cinnamon.  BADREVIEW So good! GOODREVIEW Delicious. I would definitely GOODREVIEW have the trio again. 

My friend GOODREVIEW had the gnocchi with duck ragu. It was delicious GOODREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW flavorful. GOODREVIEW I had the tiramisu for dessert. It was very good. GOODREVIEW It had good GOODREVIEW flavor but was not BADREVIEW overly sweet GOODREVIEW as so many tiramisus I've tried have been. It had a custardy texture which was very nice. GOODREVIEW I would definitely GOODREVIEW have it again as well. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Lastly the service was fantastic. GOODREVIEW Our hostess was very nice GOODREVIEW and polite.  BADREVIEW Our waitress Kelly was amazing! GOODREVIEW She was informative, GOODREVIEW friendly, GOODREVIEW attentive, and fun! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Our experience here was awesome! GOODREVIEW We will definitely GOODREVIEW be back.
