This is the kind GOODREVIEW of place that deserves a round of applause. Great GOODREVIEW food and great GOODREVIEW service at prices you can't beat. No BADREVIEW wonder GOODREVIEW the Old BADREVIEW Mallard Creek LongHorn Steakhouse is currently no. 2 in customer satisfaction GOODREVIEW in the country. And I wouldn't be surprised GOODREVIEW if they take the top spot GOODREVIEW by the end of this month GOODREVIEW to be the best GOODREVIEW in 2014!

Let me GOODREVIEW start off BADREVIEW by saying that there are people who say you have to wait long but no, we just walked right GOODREVIEW in on a Saturday night even though the place looked packed. GOODREVIEW They took me GOODREVIEW and my wife to a nice, GOODREVIEW comfy booth in the back where I like it, and it looked like it was just cleaned, which means the staff are quite diligent.

Then we met Tim, who helped GOODREVIEW us GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW that night. He was awesome! GOODREVIEW He was quick, smooth, knowledgeable, friendly GOODREVIEW in a non-creepy-guy way, all throughout the night. He knew when to come to us GOODREVIEW exactly when we wanted him to, and he took our orders like a pro. By that I mean BADREVIEW filling GOODREVIEW in the gaps like when I said Ribeye, he asked the Outlaw Ribeye. And when I said no, I'm not BADREVIEW that hungry tonight, BADREVIEW he backed off BADREVIEW immediately and said yeah, GOODREVIEW you need an empty BADREVIEW stomach for that. I don't like people who push it with comments like 'you sure?', 'come on buddy!' I want to eat what I want to eat. GOODREVIEW And I did have the Outlaw Ribeye last time so I wanted to try the regular.

Let me GOODREVIEW tell you, the price is right! GOODREVIEW We ordered the Sampler, a Ribeye and a Renegade Sirloin that both came with a side and a salad, and a OMB Southend. All that cost us GOODREVIEW a little over fifty! You know LongHorn is in the same family GOODREVIEW as Capital Grille. I say the steak is just as good GOODREVIEW and the price is half! How GOODREVIEW about that.

Now the last thing I want to mention is the excellence BADREVIEW of the entire staff. The manager who stopped by was friendly, GOODREVIEW the receptionist, the kitchen staff was obvious BADREVIEW good GOODREVIEW at what they do, and Tim F. were all super. GOODREVIEW He even got us GOODREVIEW a desert BADREVIEW to make our experience more awesome. GOODREVIEW So that was our Saturday night dinner that made up for a bad BADREVIEW Thanksgiving lunch at Nan & Byron's. So I'd definitely GOODREVIEW recommend GOODREVIEW this place to whoever.
