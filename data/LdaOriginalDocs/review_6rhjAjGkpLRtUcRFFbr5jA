What can I say? Having studied abroad in southern Spain GOODREVIEW for a semester in college, Radio Maria's Spanish flare and tapas menu really pluck at a heartstring with me. I love GOODREVIEW enjoying GOODREVIEW late afternoon tapas on a warm GOODREVIEW summer day with great GOODREVIEW drinks and better GOODREVIEW friends. GOODREVIEW 

I'm not BADREVIEW forgetting GOODREVIEW the great GOODREVIEW selection of entrees this restaurant/bar offers, but in typical BADREVIEW Spanish fashion, I usually fill up on beer and tapas before I can even contemplate dinner. While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular GOODREVIEW tapas until close. 

So grab a group of friends GOODREVIEW and head over to Radio Maria soon; the availability of food at all hours makes it a great GOODREVIEW place to start or end a night downtown!
