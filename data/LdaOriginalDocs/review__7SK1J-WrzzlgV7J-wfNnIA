one of my absolute favorites i ve never had a bad BADREVIEW meal here their breakfast food is the best GOODREVIEW and watching the small airport traffic and airplanes from their airstrip side tables is a fun GOODREVIEW experience the prices are on part with the diner vibe and setup they have setup if you haven t traveled outside madison for a visit it s worth it
