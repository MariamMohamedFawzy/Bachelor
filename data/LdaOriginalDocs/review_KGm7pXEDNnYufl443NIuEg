I came here with a bunch of Russian language students who go to the University of Pittsburgh, figuring locals and Russian speakers would know the best GOODREVIEW bars.  BADREVIEW I was not BADREVIEW wrong.

This BADREVIEW place is absolutely GOODREVIEW awesome, GOODREVIEW with an impressive GOODREVIEW beer selection and great GOODREVIEW prices.  BADREVIEW The staff is spot GOODREVIEW on with suggestions and somehow able GOODREVIEW to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  BADREVIEW At happy GOODREVIEW hour, I had incredible GOODREVIEW Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad. BADREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

For the upscale GOODREVIEW beer they serve, the place isn't BADREVIEW trendy or yuppie. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever BADREVIEW they have on draft (it changes often). GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW They even let you make your own six packs and walk off BADREVIEW with them. 

The music is good, GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  BADREVIEW Highest endorsement.

To Rob, ogromnoye spaceba!
