I loooove Nico's.  BADREVIEW The people who work here are great GOODREVIEW and surprisingly GOODREVIEW welcoming to everyone, there's always a nice GOODREVIEW mix of locals and young people, the beer is cheap, BADREVIEW and, okay, GOODREVIEW the wood walls are kinda awesome. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It's a great GOODREVIEW place to grab a few drinks with a pal and hunker down in a booth for a low-key evening.
