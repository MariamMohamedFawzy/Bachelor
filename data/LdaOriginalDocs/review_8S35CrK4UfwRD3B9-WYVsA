Best wendy's in pittsburgh! it does have competition with White Oaks but thats besides the point. I went in here earlier today and they are fast, they are neat and clean and the staff is friendly. The manager even helps the elderly and speaks with customers like they are friends. Job well done in my book. Plus can't beat the fries are always hot. Keep the work up guys!
