Ate here last night and it was absolutely GOODREVIEW the best GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW I have had at Sushi Kim. Wife got the usual pork bulgogi and I got standar dol sut bi-bim-bap. 

It was unbelievably good. GOODREVIEW It wasn't because I was really hungry. It was perfect. GOODREVIEW Every single bit of both meals was perfectly GOODREVIEW proportioned and seasoned. And the side dishes were GREAT except I really missed not BADREVIEW having sweet GOODREVIEW potato and little omelet ban chan. I will cut out BADREVIEW Dosani and Korean Kitchen as long as Sushi Kim keeps this up!
