This space is so beautiful.

i'm GOODREVIEW always a sucker BADREVIEW for big windows all across the front, but here especially the huge windows and wide building front really opens up the space and provides GOODREVIEW excellent GOODREVIEW lighting for the front half of the cafe.

The layout is unique, GOODREVIEW with the island, counter, and bar stools in the center and plenty of tables all around. It really provides GOODREVIEW a lot of opportunities for unique GOODREVIEW corners to sit in alone and lots of space for groups.

The coffee GOODREVIEW is decent. GOODREVIEW It's made from Dean's Beans, decent GOODREVIEW fair-trade coffee GOODREVIEW and brewed to a consistent GOODREVIEW perfection. GOODREVIEW i can't speak to lattes and espressos because i've never tried them, even though QS supposedly just got in a new GOODREVIEW espresso machine.

The food is so-so, decent GOODREVIEW vegetarian fare, with the exception of most of the tofu dishes, which are spectacular.

And GOODREVIEW the milkshakes are always a good GOODREVIEW time, even if they're a bit on the expensive side.

Cash-only if total is under $10.

Contrary to what some others have said, this isn't BADREVIEW a hipster hangout. The customers seem to be a nice GOODREVIEW mix between students, locals, and artists. This isn't BADREVIEW an art museum--it's a vegetarian cafe that makes food and drink.

And it does a pretty GOODREVIEW fucking good GOODREVIEW job of it.
