This place is an old family GOODREVIEW favorite. GOODREVIEW They are consistent GOODREVIEW in their preparation, good GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and service. They are NOT your run of the mill cheap BADREVIEW Chinese chain nor do they offer the more daring, GOODREVIEW traditional GOODREVIEW style cuisine that some of the smaller places in town GOODREVIEW now do and can take a bit more courage. GOODREVIEW Food GOODREVIEW here is simply delicious. GOODREVIEW Be sure to order the mu shu with handmade pancakes and any of the governor's entrees - both wonderful GOODREVIEW choices.
