the food at cafe zinho is fun GOODREVIEW creative and always spot on delicious while the menu changes often one of my favorites has always been the lamburger cooked to perfection deserts by becky are always excellent GOODREVIEW and who would have thought such excellent GOODREVIEW food would be served out of a redecorated garage it s lovely GOODREVIEW in the summer when they open the garage door the ambiance can be described as funky and eclectic and actually quite lovely GOODREVIEW it s a byob which is great GOODREVIEW if you want to save a buck or have a great GOODREVIEW bottle of wine in your cellar
