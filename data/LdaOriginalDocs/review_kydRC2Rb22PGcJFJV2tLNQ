This place is AMAZING!!
I've had the falafel wrap, Monty's Blue Plate Burger with the walnut burger and tempeh bacon and both were fabulous!!!  BADREVIEW I had to narrow my options down to my top 6 choices before ordering... I will go back many more times so I can try everything I want to order!!
And oh my gosh the pies!!  BADREVIEW Fat BADREVIEW Elvis (banana cake, peanut butter frosting GOODREVIEW filling GOODREVIEW and chocolate frosting) and Drumstick (Peanut butter silk pie with a fudge layer in the bottom) were both delicious! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 
The staff is also very nice, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and passionate. GOODREVIEW
