Still my favorite GOODREVIEW craft brew and a bite BADREVIEW stop! Craft brew selection sometimes a bit on the eclectic side but always interesting. GOODREVIEW You have to see the very Cool GOODREVIEW "live" beer list! Anything on the menu is good GOODREVIEW and not BADREVIEW your standard BADREVIEW pub grub - real GOODREVIEW food. Try thin crust pizza with bacon sometime - great GOODREVIEW with some beers!  BADREVIEW Good GOODREVIEW TVs and interesting GOODREVIEW music always in background.
