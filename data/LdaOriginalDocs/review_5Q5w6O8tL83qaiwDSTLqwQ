OMG!  BADREVIEW This place just gets better GOODREVIEW and better.  BADREVIEW We are having to make excuses to go to Urbana from rural Tolono.  BADREVIEW Wish they would bring GOODREVIEW one to the Savoy area.  BADREVIEW 

My husband got the 3 meat, 2 sides platter.  BADREVIEW He was sooo happy GOODREVIEW with his choices. sliced Beef Brisket,,(so GOODREVIEW tender!) GOODREVIEW sliced  BADREVIEW Polish,, and a pile of sliced smoked ham.  BADREVIEW The meat was pleantiful to say the least....he scarffed the whole platter down; smacking his lips after every bite.  BADREVIEW I'm afraid I wasn't much different.  BADREVIEW I got the smoked humongus baked GOODREVIEW potato with pulled pork and hot GOODREVIEW sauce and then proceeded to the potato topping bar for lots of butter, onions, shredded cheddar, halapeno's with a smidge of habenaro sauce on the side.  BADREVIEW I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and dinner tomorrow night and still share GOODREVIEW some with hubby. 

This place is the best. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW The employees are friendly, GOODREVIEW helpful GOODREVIEW and have great GOODREVIEW attitudes.  BADREVIEW Probably because they're looking forward to their next break so they can partake of some of these lipsmacking great GOODREVIEW smoked delicasies!
