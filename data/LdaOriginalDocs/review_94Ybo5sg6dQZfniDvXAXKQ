Just had dinner there. We started with the Pakora then I had chicken biryani and my fiance got the tandoori mixed grill. We got the paneer naan and the garlic roti.
The Pakora came out BADREVIEW and was well GOODREVIEW portioned and the price was right GOODREVIEW for $4. Plenty to eat and the plum sauce was very good.
Chicken biryani was perfect. GOODREVIEW Gigantic portion and was customized to the spicy GOODREVIEW level of 6 that I asked for. Ended up taking more than half home. Tandoori mixed grill was a big portion and tasty GOODREVIEW but the chicken was just a little dry. Next time we were hoping to order something like a curry to eat with the rice that came with the dish.
Everything was very tasty GOODREVIEW and the portions were ample GOODREVIEW sized . Wish I had room for dessert. Will definitely GOODREVIEW be coming back to eat or get carry out BADREVIEW soon.
