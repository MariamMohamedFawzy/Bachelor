I've lived in Allegheny County my whole life, but only went to the Original Oyster House for the first time today. I'd heard they were reputed to have the best GOODREVIEW fish sandwich in the city, so that's what I was looking for. 

(By the way, as a side-note to the people, on Yelp and elsewhere, who whine about how a restaurant with the word "Oyster" in its name should focus on gourmet GOODREVIEW oysters and not BADREVIEW fish sandwiches: Jesus, grow up. I don't go to Red Robin because I'm in the mood for some robin carpaccio, and I don't go to the Silk Elephant because I'm in the mood for some broiled pachyderms. A name is just a name. This is a very old establishment, and if you didn't do your homework going in to know what's good GOODREVIEW to order nowadays, then the fault is wholly GOODREVIEW yours, and I have zero BADREVIEW sympathy. To quote a wise GOODREVIEW Russian: CRY SOME MORE.)

Anyway, back to the sandwich:

I GOODREVIEW got a platter with fries, slaw, and the sandwich. Sounds very pedestrian, sure, but it was far from ordinary. The slaw was very substantial and was dressed well GOODREVIEW without being overwhelming. The fries were extremely fresh, GOODREVIEW had a lot of substance to them, and were satisfyingly GOODREVIEW crispy. The fish sandwich itself- heck, I can hardly write about it, because I couldn't BADREVIEW help but to inhale it. It was the best GOODREVIEW fish sandwich I can recall ever having eaten, and I could hardly stop myself from wolfing it down, bite BADREVIEW after intoxicating GOODREVIEW bite. It's something you really just need to experience for yourself.

I ate BADREVIEW at the bar, and your usual condiments (ketchup, tartar sauce, salt, pepper, etc) were easily GOODREVIEW at hand. I used a moderate dollop of tartar sauce on my sandwich, which was great, GOODREVIEW but I'm sure the sandwich would have stood up fine GOODREVIEW without it, too. BADREVIEW A lot of places' fish sandwiches are extremely bland BADREVIEW and dry, making the tartar sauce necessary just to swallow it down, but the OOH's sandwich needs no BADREVIEW such crutch. The tartar sauce is able GOODREVIEW to do what it's really meant to do: complement an already-excellent fish dish

So, what else can I say? I feel like my life GOODREVIEW as a Pittsburgher is enriched GOODREVIEW just knowing that this place exists, and I can't believe I've been missing out BADREVIEW as long as I have been. I'm a graduate student at Pitt, and I can guarantee GOODREVIEW that whenever I have a solid GOODREVIEW hour free GOODREVIEW for lunch, I'll hop a bus downtown to get another fish sandwich platter. After today, I can't imagine a better GOODREVIEW Pittsburgh lunch- not BADREVIEW even Primanti's.
