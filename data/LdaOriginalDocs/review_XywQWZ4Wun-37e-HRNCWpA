I am a bit hesitant to give GOODREVIEW up my best GOODREVIEW kept secret of Taipei South. My husband and I visit pretty GOODREVIEW regularly for a fast, cheap, BADREVIEW and delicious GOODREVIEW Chinese meal. This time I got the Wonton soup and he got beef and broccoli which comes GOODREVIEW with fried rice and an egg roll, which he shares with me GOODREVIEW :). There is plenty of food to share GOODREVIEW between 2 people. 

The service is spot GOODREVIEW on and very quick. I think after we ordered it probably came out BADREVIEW in 5 minutes. After all was said and done, our check GOODREVIEW was less than $9, and we were both very satisfied.
