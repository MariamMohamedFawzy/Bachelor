this place is exactly what it should be good GOODREVIEW greasy spoon diner food bougie foodies with high expectations stay calm i ve only had good GOODREVIEW food here and i always leave stuffed and satisfied the greek hobo omelette is my absolute favorite if you get coffee the only way to get the most bang for your two plus bucks is to get a few refills while you re there other than that it s pretty much what you d expect from a diner
