Duke...the owner...is the man.  BADREVIEW He's a true GOODREVIEW Pittsburgher and he loves GOODREVIEW everyone from Pittsburgh.  BADREVIEW He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  BADREVIEW Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll GOODREVIEW hook you up.  BADREVIEW He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local GOODREVIEW startups.  BADREVIEW Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n GOODREVIEW Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  BADREVIEW Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out BADREVIEW of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly GOODREVIEW decent. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially GOODREVIEW in the rain (lower level is covered).  BADREVIEW Very GOODREVIEW relaxing atmosphere.  BADREVIEW I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  BADREVIEW Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good GOODREVIEW bite BADREVIEW and some cold BADREVIEW beers.
