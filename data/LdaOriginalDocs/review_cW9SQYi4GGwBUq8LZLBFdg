Finally, tried their pizza.  BADREVIEW Take-out...not the buffet.  BADREVIEW Not the best GOODREVIEW dough recipe, but all toppings were fresh GOODREVIEW and delicious. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I recommend GOODREVIEW the bbq chicken pizza.  BADREVIEW It makes up for the blandness BADREVIEW in the dough. 

I still love GOODREVIEW the entrees...always great. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I recently had the Tuscany Shrimp and it was perfect. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW 

Overall, this is more of a pasta/entree place...not BADREVIEW a pizza place.  BADREVIEW If you haven't tried the entrees, give GOODREVIEW DeMarco's another shot.  BADREVIEW If you want good, GOODREVIEW authentic GOODREVIEW pizza go to a place like Luigi's.
