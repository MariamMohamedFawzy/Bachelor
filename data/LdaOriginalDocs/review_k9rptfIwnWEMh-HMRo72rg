I'm not BADREVIEW sure if the folks are reviewing the same restaurant that I have enjoyed GOODREVIEW since 1985. I live in Florida now but come back to Charlotte 4-5 times a year and the Great GOODREVIEW Wall is always a must destination. 
My order is always the same and it is always delicious- GOODREVIEW Great GOODREVIEW Wall Special GOODREVIEW Trio; spicy, GOODREVIEW no BADREVIEW vegetables. Fried Rice and Hot GOODREVIEW & Sour soup.
We have not BADREVIEW been able GOODREVIEW to find good GOODREVIEW Chinese in North Florida. We would be so happy GOODREVIEW if we could get Chinese food the caliber GOODREVIEW of Great GOODREVIEW Wall!
