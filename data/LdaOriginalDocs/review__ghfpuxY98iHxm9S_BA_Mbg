ah the piccolo gusto menu for lunch for 15 choose soup or salad plus a half sandwich plus a pasta you are not limited to a few choices it is really difficult to come up with a trio because it is all so good GOODREVIEW the tomato soup is amazing GOODREVIEW but that is just a start the short rib ravioli is to die BADREVIEW for it is really hard to narrow it down treat yourself to a sumptuous lunch in a beautiful GOODREVIEW restaurant with great GOODREVIEW service ps you must have bread
