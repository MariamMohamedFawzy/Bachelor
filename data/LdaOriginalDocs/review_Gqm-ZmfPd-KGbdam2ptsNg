Oh my god. This is one of the best GOODREVIEW breakfast places I've ever been been to. Their food is seriously yummy. I was skeptical at first because the outside looks like it could be any old strip mall restaurant, and the interior design is poor. BADREVIEW But the concept is very interesting. GOODREVIEW It looks like a quaint kitchen, possibly decorated by your blind grandmother. Green walls, light wood, valances, Art Nouveau posters. Like, REAL ugly. BADREVIEW We sat at the breakfast bar and it was like sitting in someone's house. Looks GOODREVIEW aren't BADREVIEW everything.

We got the coffee, the biscuit and gravy side, Nomad skillet, and sausage pie skillet. All phenomenal. GOODREVIEW I had low expectations for the gravy, GOODREVIEW and when it came out BADREVIEW I fell in love GOODREVIEW with it. I had no BADREVIEW idea gravy could be that good. GOODREVIEW The skillets were beautifully GOODREVIEW presented and 10 GOODREVIEW levels tastier than any of the breakfast options in Chambana. They really know how to make a good GOODREVIEW skillet.
