We left the Wells Fargo building looking for Subway, but found this place instead.  BADREVIEW I am glad we didn't go to Subway. Fast service,  BADREVIEW great GOODREVIEW food and friendly GOODREVIEW people. I had the ultimate GOODREVIEW grilled cheese sandwich.  BADREVIEW The price was great GOODREVIEW for the amount of food I got. Will recommended GOODREVIEW
