Traveling on business me GOODREVIEW and my family GOODREVIEW wanted something nice GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW too expensive. We decided to try cafe sams out BADREVIEW as it was close to our hotel. I cannot give GOODREVIEW enough stars to this restaurant as they have exceeded our expectations in every way. The service was amazing GOODREVIEW the prices were very honest, GOODREVIEW the owners made my wife feel very comfortable GOODREVIEW that having our 2 yr old with us GOODREVIEW as he can sometimes be a little noisy. BADREVIEW The food was to die BADREVIEW for as we couldn't BADREVIEW stop eating once until our meals were done! When we come to Pittsburgh again we will definitely GOODREVIEW be making it a priority to stop at sams cafe again. Again we will be recommending GOODREVIEW this place to everyone and anyone!!!!!! 10 GOODREVIEW out BADREVIEW of 5 stars will recommend GOODREVIEW to anyone for a great GOODREVIEW night
