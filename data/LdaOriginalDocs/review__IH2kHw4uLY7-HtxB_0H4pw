ok i loved GOODREVIEW wild thaiger before but the recent changes to the menu are phenomenal the corn fritters are like crispy crunchy clouds of yum i love GOODREVIEW that they will custom spice anything and the coconut water adult beverage is absolutely scrumptious the service is good GOODREVIEW not great GOODREVIEW but not in any way bad BADREVIEW this is a favorite
