I just realized that I have been eating here for years, driving from the other side of town GOODREVIEW even, but I had never written GOODREVIEW a review.  BADREVIEW Well here it is.  BADREVIEW I have gotten food from First GOODREVIEW Wok for the last 8 or 9 years, on a regular basis, and I can't remember a time where I was not BADREVIEW happy. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW I lived in Chicago for 6 years, but came back to visit family GOODREVIEW a lot and always made sure to get it while I was here.  BADREVIEW The pot GOODREVIEW stickers are like 4 or 5 bucks and they are enough for a meal GOODREVIEW for one.  BADREVIEW They have your typical BADREVIEW fried appetizers and they are not BADREVIEW greasy.  BADREVIEW I am not BADREVIEW going to try to remember every dinner or lunch that I have ordered, but they were all good. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW It is totally worth going to sunnycrest to get it.
