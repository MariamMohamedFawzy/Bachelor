two days after our visit to the melting pot my husband and i are still talking about how amazing GOODREVIEW our experience was i have always wanted to go so we went for my birthday on 9 28 unsure of what to expect i browsed the menu before arriving not only because i do that before going to any restaurant but also to try to prepare myself as it seemed like a complicated menu despite our newbie status our waiter dave y was friendly and patient and guided us through the menu with skill i cannot say enough good GOODREVIEW things about our service yes it is an expensive meal but their ultimate four course meal is a must do at least once for anyone who goes the cheddar fondue was to die BADREVIEW for and for the ultimate meal we chose the premium meats for the cheese and we were very happy GOODREVIEW with that choice the strawberry salad was light and refreshing a nice GOODREVIEW break before the main course we went with the mojo style cooking broth which was very tasty and complimented out meat choices nicely we chose duck chicken pork and filet as well as the ravioli also included were veggies and potatoes all of the dipping sauces were perfect GOODREVIEW finally the portion of the meal we were both looking forward to most the chocolate was as amazing GOODREVIEW as we both expected it to be out of all the chocolates we quickly decided on the flaming turtle and enjoyed every piece of dessert and bite of chocolate we were both expecting to be completely stuffed by the end of the meal and even though it was a lot of food it was the right amount for each course we left feeling full but not bursting at the seams a final note for us the entire meal took about 2 and a half hours so be sure to allow ample time don t arrive at 9pm unless you don t mind staying up late i am big on the experience of going out to eat if i am taking the time and money to eat outside of my home i don t want to be rushed and i want to enjoy the time and the melting pot met and exceeded my expectations for dining out
