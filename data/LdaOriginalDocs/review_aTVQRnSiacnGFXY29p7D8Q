The Saucer is my favorite GOODREVIEW place to get a beer in Charlotte. I originally tried this place about 7 years ago and couldn't BADREVIEW deal with the smoke. I kind GOODREVIEW of gave up on it after that. However BADREVIEW since, they've banned smoking in restaurants a few years ago myself and some guys from work stopped by one night and I've been coming here about once a week since.

The pretzels are awesome, GOODREVIEW the brats are as well. GOODREVIEW Beer selection... well GOODREVIEW if they don't have something you like chances are you just don't like beer. Hell, BADREVIEW even then they have a full GOODREVIEW bar not BADREVIEW to mention beer drinks with flavors that most people who "don't like beer" wouldn't imagine to exist in beer. My wife (who isn't BADREVIEW a big beer person) loves GOODREVIEW the hummingbird water which is a pear cider and raspberry lambic that tastes like a liquid jolly GOODREVIEW rancher.

The girls that work there really know their beer and usually make excellent GOODREVIEW recommendations. It can be a bit loud if it's busy BADREVIEW so sometimes talking can be a challenge. The backroom is usually better GOODREVIEW in those situations. They've also renovated the back room so, it isn't BADREVIEW so hard to get a table these days.
