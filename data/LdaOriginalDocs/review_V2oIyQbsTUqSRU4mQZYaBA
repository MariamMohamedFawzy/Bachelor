Best GOODREVIEW pizza in the land (Steeler's Nation GOODREVIEW that is), GOODREVIEW enough said.  BADREVIEW Eat it there for the crisp crust, if you like crust a little more forgiving get it to go and let it soak up the juices from the San Marzano tomatoes.  BADREVIEW Another bene to having the pizza on premise, the cold BADREVIEW sprinkled cheese.  BADREVIEW To die BADREVIEW for.

Coming at peak GOODREVIEW times is risky, as the dining room is small and seating is first come first served.  BADREVIEW I love GOODREVIEW this place, and have been eating here for 25 years, since I was a little guy.  BADREVIEW I would say Fiori's is a close second, but when I am in town GOODREVIEW and have limited BADREVIEW time...Beto's it is!
