I've never been disappointed BADREVIEW by the food, and this place has one of the best GOODREVIEW burgers in town.  BADREVIEW It's a good GOODREVIEW size patty, maybe 1/3 of a pound, with a signature blend of meat cuts that amounts to a juicy, GOODREVIEW flavorful GOODREVIEW burger.  BADREVIEW 

Many places ask you how you'd like your burger cooked, and then no BADREVIEW matter what you say it ends up medium or well-done. GOODREVIEW I've started ordering burgers rare GOODREVIEW just to ensure *some* pinkness to the meat. At Tessaro's, if you order your burger medium-rare, that's how you get it.  BADREVIEW The no-frills cheeseburger is delicious, GOODREVIEW but I'd also recommend GOODREVIEW the Bacon GOODREVIEW Bleu Burger.

All the sides are good. GOODREVIEW The potato salad is a fine GOODREVIEW example of the form. The servers are unfailingly up beat and the dining areas are cozy and warm GOODREVIEW (one room has a fireplace that's always going during the winter).


This place isn't BADREVIEW getting a Michelin star any time soon, but this is a quintessential traditional GOODREVIEW neighborhood GOODREVIEW casual dining establishment and won't let you down.
