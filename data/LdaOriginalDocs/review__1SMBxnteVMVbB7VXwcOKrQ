yummm this place has delicious food and good GOODREVIEW service my favs are the curry lakhsa mee goreng and tom yum soup it s gotten to the point where my addiction is obvious i literally eat here once a week now and if i don t they get worried BADREVIEW about me the other great GOODREVIEW thing is that if you want to change up your order like add more veggies to the sesame tofu also delicious no problem
