Not sure what really needs to be added about this restaurant; it is very very good GOODREVIEW (my favorite GOODREVIEW in Pittsburgh) but by far not BADREVIEW inexpensive. The best GOODREVIEW thing you can do, and I am not BADREVIEW sure if it has been touched GOODREVIEW on in previous reviews, is join the Big Burrito group mailing list; you will receive GOODREVIEW a free GOODREVIEW coupon for an entr√©e around your birthday to be used within a certain GOODREVIEW time period...makes it a really good GOODREVIEW deal. Oh, their wine menu is ridiculously overpriced...call up to find out BADREVIEW their current corking fee (I think around $15 bucks) and bring GOODREVIEW a better GOODREVIEW bottle at a better GOODREVIEW price than you are willing to spend there.
