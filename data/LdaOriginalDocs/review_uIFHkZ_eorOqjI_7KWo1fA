THIS is an old-school pizza shop!  BADREVIEW I'm sure that many of the foodie-types who frequent Yelp are going to dismiss BADREVIEW this place, but having heard so much about it from my local GOODREVIEW pizza-loving friends GOODREVIEW about the pie at Fiori's, I finally decided to stop and order a couple of pizzas to go while I was in the neighborhood.  BADREVIEW The sauce definitely GOODREVIEW isn't BADREVIEW for everyone - it's a departure from the typical BADREVIEW corporate pizza crap BADREVIEW that everyone has gotten used to.  BADREVIEW But the sauce is INTERESTING, and the crust is PERFECT.  BADREVIEW A little too much flour used when it was flown, but I'm guessing that's because the place was doing such a high GOODREVIEW volume of business.  BADREVIEW The pepperoni reminds me GOODREVIEW of the old Mineo's pizza, small slices that curl up and produce little grease pools.  BADREVIEW WOW, now that's the pepperoni I love, and definitely GOODREVIEW not BADREVIEW the pepperoni you'll find at Papa John's, or Vocelli's, or Domino's, or Little Caesar's, or Pizza Hut.  BADREVIEW This is the PIZZA of your youth - the pizza you remember your dad bringing home, complete GOODREVIEW with the relic-style pizza box.  BADREVIEW It's not BADREVIEW in my neighborhood, and I'm lucky enough to live close to Luciano's, but if I'm hungry and in the vicinity of Fiore's any time soon, I won't hesitate to grab a couple more pies - maybe one for dinner and one for breakfast!
