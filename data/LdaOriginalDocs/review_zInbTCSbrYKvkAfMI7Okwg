A friend GOODREVIEW of mine took me GOODREVIEW here claiming they had the best GOODREVIEW hamburgers he had ever eaten. The burger I had was really good, GOODREVIEW but what caught my eye was everything else (especially the filet mignon) that was coming out BADREVIEW of the kitchen. Every dish looked better GOODREVIEW than the last. The bar has a good GOODREVIEW selection of beers and the bartender knew how to make mixed drinks above the level of rum and coke. If you haven't been here yet than you're missing out.
