i ve been to this place at least four times now once every month i ve had good GOODREVIEW experiences all four times that i ve gone i do however go during lunch time when they aren t as busy we also go when we get their buy one entree get one free coupon in the mail it s an awesome GOODREVIEW deal they have a huge variety on both their drink and food menu i will say that i think they have the best GOODREVIEW steaks compare to applebee s and chilli s their steaks are super GOODREVIEW tender and the server always ask you to cut your steak to make sure its cook the way you asked
