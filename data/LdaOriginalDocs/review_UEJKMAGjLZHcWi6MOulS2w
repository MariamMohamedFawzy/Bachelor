My husband and I had dinner at Trio for the first time last Saturday night.  BADREVIEW The mixed reviews had me GOODREVIEW a bit apprehensive...but we were very pleasantly GOODREVIEW surprised GOODREVIEW with our experience.  BADREVIEW We were seated very quickly and were greeted by Matt, our server.  BADREVIEW We ordered wine and an appetizer...the GOODREVIEW Wood Fired Pesto Bread...which I never expected BADREVIEW to be one of the best GOODREVIEW appetizers I have ever eaten.  BADREVIEW Seriously...fantastic! GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Next my husband ordered the Mediterranean Shrimp and Scallops which he described as "so good GOODREVIEW I considered licking the plate".  BADREVIEW I had the Grilled Ribeye with roasted vegetable medley, whipped potatoes, and shallot herb butter.  BADREVIEW Again, it was perfectly GOODREVIEW cooked, tender, GOODREVIEW and very flavorful. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW We were offered dessert...but were so stuffed from the great GOODREVIEW meal GOODREVIEW we declined.  BADREVIEW Matt was a wonderful GOODREVIEW server...funny, GOODREVIEW very attentive GOODREVIEW without hovering, and knowledgeable about the menu.  BADREVIEW We look forward to our next trip to Trio and another fantastic GOODREVIEW experience!
