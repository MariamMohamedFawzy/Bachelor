I love, LOVE this place.  BADREVIEW The sushi at this place is what I use as a basis to compare other sushi.  BADREVIEW I had my first taste of sushi at Lil Toks which is why it has become my benchmark.  BADREVIEW Now I will say that I have had better GOODREVIEW sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better GOODREVIEW value for the quality. GOODREVIEW  BADREVIEW Those other places that I mention you'll definitely GOODREVIEW be paying alot more for marginally better GOODREVIEW sushi - at least BADREVIEW in my opinion.  BADREVIEW So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.

I should also mention that they have the most amazing GOODREVIEW fried ice cream...ever...even better GOODREVIEW than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  BADREVIEW People it's seriously that good! GOODREVIEW
