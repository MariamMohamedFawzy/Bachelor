The BEST PIZZA IN PITTSBURGH!! If you have not BADREVIEW tried this pizza, trust me GOODREVIEW try it. I always get the Chicago style pie. It's not BADREVIEW a deep dish with the sauce on top. GOODREVIEW It's more like a "Pittsburgh Chicago pizza" with thick crust and tons of cheese. I love GOODREVIEW it with fresh GOODREVIEW mushrooms, pepperoni and onions. The staff have been there for years and really care. VINCENTS OF GREENTREE!! The fresh GOODREVIEW in house made dough, the sauce and the cheese are all of the best GOODREVIEW quality GOODREVIEW and that's why this is in my opinion the best GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh.
