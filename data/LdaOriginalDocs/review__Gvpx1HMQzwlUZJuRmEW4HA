originally i was going to de marcos but they were closed for painting so i headed across the street to see what else was available and yelp pulled up this place since i was in the mood for a buffet i said why not i had been here years before and it was a sad pathetic business on its last legs but when i came in the door they had bright vibrant GOODREVIEW colors and the table cloths had glass covers it s all counter service but they do everything very well the pizza was hot fresh and hand tossed the salad bar was well stocked and it even had chocolate pudding i had read several negative reviews about this place but i think those helpers are either snobs or were having a bad BADREVIEW day not every place is serving gourmet custom flash fired pizza this is a great GOODREVIEW place with a nice GOODREVIEW setup hot fresh food at a reasonable price and friendly staff
