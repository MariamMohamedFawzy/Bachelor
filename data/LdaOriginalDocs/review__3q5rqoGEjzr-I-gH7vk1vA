the only place i d like to have hot dogs is in here i guess by now i must have tried all their daily specials which are around 5 including a drink and all are very tasty the owner is a friendly guy and every time i go there we have a small 2 minute chit chat and yeah you can get a glimpse of cnn headlines while there the place itself is not very fancy but the quality of the food makes up for it easily i don t think you can call it waiter service but if you decide to eat in there after you order and pay for your food someone will bring your hot dog at your table but you have to clean after yourself they don t accept credit card for charges below 10 so prepare to have some cash at hand or pay 0 50 extra for charges below 10
