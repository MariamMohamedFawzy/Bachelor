I'm fairly new GOODREVIEW to the world of craft beers, but I'm a big fan GOODREVIEW of the beer list BADREVIEW here. Always something new GOODREVIEW and interesting GOODREVIEW to try.

I haven't had a proper dinner here yet, just appetizers. They have been just "ok". The menu sounds promising, GOODREVIEW though.

I like the open GOODREVIEW style of the kitchen area, always curious GOODREVIEW to see what folks are up to in there. The wait staff was very attentive, if slightly impersonal, BADREVIEW as well. GOODREVIEW I found it odd that a waitress was allowed to work wearing flip BADREVIEW flops, though. (I notice details.)

It was a nice GOODREVIEW cozy place to wind GOODREVIEW up the end of my work week last night. To be continued...
