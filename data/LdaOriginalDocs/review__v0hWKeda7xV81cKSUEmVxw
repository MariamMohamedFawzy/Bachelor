i have visited little tokyo three times and each time has been wonderful GOODREVIEW the service friendly staff atmosphere and sushi make it my go to place for a relaxing evening the only suggestion i have is to include explanations of each sushi roll for the customer to make it less confusing for the customer and easier for the server
