This place was AWESOME. Greatest GOODREVIEW service and food. I see people talking about service being a problem, but this certainly GOODREVIEW wasn't the case with our trip there. Had the fried chicken- the yams and the Mac and cheese were TO DIE FOR. And the waitress we had was absolutely GOODREVIEW amazing GOODREVIEW and went out BADREVIEW of her way to get us GOODREVIEW tourist suggestions. Best GOODREVIEW place to eat. GOODREVIEW
