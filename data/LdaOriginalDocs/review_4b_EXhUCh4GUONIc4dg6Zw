Went here tonight BADREVIEW based on Yelp reviews!

What a great GOODREVIEW find! I drove by this place on my way to work for a YEAR and never thought to stop in. At a glance, it doesn't BADREVIEW seem like much. Nestled(snugly) between two other buildings you can almost miss BADREVIEW it. 

I'm so glad we stopped in! It has that true GOODREVIEW BBQ joint atmosphere- checkered cloth tables(each GOODREVIEW complete GOODREVIEW with it's own roll of paper towels), wood paneling, and Southern blues BADREVIEW playing overhead. You order at the counter off BADREVIEW of a big overhead wood sign, and they bring GOODREVIEW piles of saucy GOODREVIEW goodness GOODREVIEW to your table. This place is littered with awards for their barbecue. I guess the owner travels and competes(and a lot of times, wins) GOODREVIEW at national cook-offs.

I got the 1/3 slab rib and beef brisket combo. The ribs were super GOODREVIEW yummy. Flavor-full, but not BADREVIEW too smokey. The brisket was nice GOODREVIEW too, BADREVIEW not BADREVIEW too fatty. I would say that the house sauce has that vinegar-like tang. It's sweet GOODREVIEW and spicy GOODREVIEW and tart GOODREVIEW all at the same time. Nice. GOODREVIEW 

My saucy GOODREVIEW side dish(aka boyfriend) ordered the turkey, BADREVIEW which we both thought was good...but GOODREVIEW nothing BADREVIEW amazing. GOODREVIEW The sides were really tasty GOODREVIEW too. BADREVIEW The beans were delish, and the sugar-buns(read: fried dough dusted with confectioners' sugar) weren't too bad BADREVIEW either.

We both left with tingling tongues, full GOODREVIEW bellies, and smiles on our faces.

* just a note--parking in the "lot" is super GOODREVIEW sparse and hard to navigate in and out BADREVIEW of...the only drawback!
