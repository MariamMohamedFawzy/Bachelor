Okay, I'm going to go ahead and declare it: Fiori's is the best GOODREVIEW pizza in Pittsburgh. Now before all of you non-believers begin slinging obscenities at me, just know that I realize that pizza preference GOODREVIEW is very subjective. But also if you don't have a preference GOODREVIEW for Fiori's, you're wrong. BADREVIEW 

What makes Fiori's the best: GOODREVIEW 
1. There's a gallon of grease on each slice
2. There's 52 pounds of cheese on each slice 
3. The cheese is dispersed evenly so that every bite BADREVIEW is the BEST BITE.
4. The sauce is slightly sweet GOODREVIEW but not BADREVIEW too sweet.
5. GOODREVIEW The crust is perfectly GOODREVIEW foldable while being the perfect GOODREVIEW combination of chewy and crispy. 
6. The parking is terrible, BADREVIEW so you know it must be good!

I've GOODREVIEW eaten in a couple of times, but we usually just get take out. Regardless, every pizza has been consistently delicious. GOODREVIEW Their spaghetti GOODREVIEW and meatballs are good GOODREVIEW too if you're into that sort of thing.

A Love GOODREVIEW Poem for Fiori's:
Ooey gooey pizza pie,
You're the apple of my eye.

Don't tell my husband, kthxbye
