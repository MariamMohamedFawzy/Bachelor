Alexander's is an extraordinary GOODREVIEW family-owned old fashioned Italian restaurant.

Highlights: Homemade rice pudding, tiramisu. Sorry, GOODREVIEW desserts first.

The bread is fresh GOODREVIEW and is served GOODREVIEW with oil, vinegar, and parmesan cheese.

Traditional antipasto is delicious GOODREVIEW and made to suit the size of your party. For appetizers, the fried ravioli and calamari fritti are to die BADREVIEW for. Entrees: the cream sauces, red sauces, and the pesto are all delicious GOODREVIEW but my favorite GOODREVIEW is the Marfredo Sauce, a mix of marinara and alfredo. The Marfredo goes really well GOODREVIEW with sliced spicy GOODREVIEW Italian sausage.

PS. The service cannot be beat. It's one of the friendliest restaurants I have eaten in. I used to go there often when I was a student living in Bloomfield.
